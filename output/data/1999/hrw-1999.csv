But that fact is barely acknowledged in Proposition 21, the juvenile crime initiative on the March 7 ballot. The proposition would expand the number of children tried as adults in order to combat what it calls the """"larger and more ominous threat"""" of crime by youth. This """"threat"""" is rhetorical smoke and mirrors. Proposition 21 is an objectionable, unnecessary measure that deserves to be defeated. One of Proposition 21's harshest aspects is its provision requiring an adult prison term for anyone sixteen years of age or older who is convicted in adult court. Adult facilities are not equipped to address the needs of youth. They often lack adequate education, medical services, or mental health care. In some cases they pose serious threats to the personal safety of young detainees. Human Rights Watch's research has documented these risks in investigations around the country. Last year I spoke with seventeen-year-old Joey N. at the Baltimore City Detention Center, where he had spent more than six months. He reported that the adult detainees continually harassed him by throwing excrement and urine in his cell. In desperation, he resorted to telling the guards that he was suicidal, and they moved him to the psychiatric wing for several days. When Joey returned to the section, he asked the guards to place him in an isolation cell. Heavy metal sheets completely covered the bars, preventing other detainees from throwing feces into the cell but also blocking all natural light. There is no evidence that treating children as adults reduces crime. A study comparing Connecticut, which had the highest juvenile-to-adult transfer rate in the United States, with Colorado, the state with the lowest rate of such transfers, found that the youth crime rate was the same in each state. Similarly, studies of violent juvenile crime in Idaho, Florida, and New York have found that making it easier to try youth as adults does not deter violent juvenile crime. In fact, California already has the option of transferring the most serious offenders to adult court. Transfers now take place in court, in front of a judge, with the opportunity for a fair hearing. Proposition 21 would make such transfers mandatory in some cases and give prosecutors the final word in many others. Giving prosecutors unfettered discretion over who is charged as an adult is particularly unwise. Without clear standards or judicial oversight, prosecutors' decisions will vary from county to county—creating """"justice by geography,"""" in the words of legal scholar Barry Feld. These overly broad powers can easily lead to other abuses of discretion, particularly when prosecutors charge youth of color. In Minneapolis and its suburbs, for example, only 28 percent of youth charged as adults are white—even though white youth make up 55 percent of violent youthful offenders. Minority youth constitute less than one-fifth of the area's population but 72 percent of all youth charged as adults. Even with the procedural safeguards of the current judicial transfer system, minority youth in California are significantly more likely to be sent to adult courts than their white counterparts. A study released this month by the Justice Policy Institute found that compared with white youth, children of color are 2.8 times more likely to be charged with violent crimes, 6.2 times more likely to be tried in adult court, and 7 times more likely to be sentenced to prison when they are tried as adults. These stark disparities suggest that Proposition 21 will hit minority youth the hardest, resulting in even greater numbers of children of color behind bars in adult prisons. Sending children to adult courts and locking them up with hardened offenders will not reduce crime. Nor will it help these youth become productive members of society. As James S., a seventeen-year-old held in Rockville, Maryland, said to me, """"Being here with adults, that ain't going to rehabilitate me, it's just teaching me to be a better criminal.""""","United States","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Following a summary trial on Sunday in Beijing, Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen, Ji Liewu, and Yao Jie were given sentences ranging from seven to eighteen years in prison. """"These Falun Gong members should never have been arrested, much less given heavy sentences,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"If freedom of association and assembly mean anything in China, then Falun Gong members should be free to recruit others, to practice their exercises and meditation in public, and to protest their own persecution.""""   Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to publicly censure the Chinese government at the next meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva for the suppression of Falun Gong, imprisonment of pro-democracy activists, widespread torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and other violations of international human rights standards.   """"Any hope that China's signature on two U.N. human rights treaties signaled a commitment by China to change its practices is just about gone,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. In October 1998, Beijing signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guaranteeing freedom of expression, belief, and association, but China has not yet ratified it.   The verdicts in the Falun Gong trials came just days after a China-European Union (E.U.) summit during which Premier Zhu Rongji called again for dialogue, not confrontation, on human rights. At the same time, China deflected all calls for change on specific human rights issues. Other human rights dialogues with the E.U., the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Australia, among others, have had disappointing results, but no government has yet decided to press for China's censure at the next regular session of the U.N. Commission which convenes in March.   By the Chinese government's own count, some 150 members of Falun Gong have been formally arrested; many others have been sent to labor camps after being administratively sentenced without trial. """"We call on the Chinese government to immediately make public the names of all those formally arrested, where they are being held, and what they are being charged with,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"They should all be promptly released.""""   Since its decision on July 22 to ban Falun Gong, the Chinese leadership has made clear its intention to smash the fast-growing movement. First the authorities banned it, then later extended the reach of China's criminal law to justify the severe measures it has been taking.

We further request access to Chechnya—in particular to the village of Alkhan-Yurt—to continue our investigation.  There can be no doubt that Russian troops committed serious crimes in Alkhan Yurt after December 1. As you know, Russian forces took control of Alkhan-Yurt on December 1, after intense shelling and after encountering strong Chechen resistance, and began mop-up operations in the village. Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than two dozen witnesses to the events that transpired in Alkhan-Yurt after December 1. Nearly all witnesses were interviewed separately and at great length, and their testimonies were consistent, credible, and mutually confirming. On the basis of these interviews, we have found that after December 1 Russian soldiers murdered at least 17 civilians, engaged in widespread looting, and burned down a number of homes. Among the civilians murdered in Alkhan-Yurt after Russian forces took control of the village were the following seventeen people: Nabitst Kornukayeva, aged over 100, and her son Arbi Kornukayev, aged 65. A neighbor heard several shots at about 3:30 p.m. on December 2, coming from the Kornukayev residence. On December 4, Zara, a distant relative, found the two bodies close to the door. Both had several automatic gunshot wounds across their chest, and Nabitst was still holding the cane she used to walk. The gates to the home were broken, and tracks of armored personnel carriers could be seen in the yard.The house was burned down, and is believed to have been looted. Maret Pashayeva, aged 65, Deti Temirsultanova, aged 70, and her daughter Sordat, aged 35. The three women were hiding in their neighbor's basement on Suvorov Street. They were killed on December 1 when Russian soldiers threw a grenade into their cellar. The three women were buried in Goyty. Mamed Zanaraliyev and Alimkhan Dalakov, both aged 37. They are believed to have been shot by Russian soldiers during the first days of December, and their bodies were placed under a tractor which was covered with wooden planks and set afire. The homestead where they were killed was looted and torched. Their bodies were discovered under the rubble almost two weeks later, and were buried on December 16. Khamid Khazuyev, 57 years old, was killed on December 3. Before they fled, other villagers had given Mr. Khazuyev, a former police lieutenant, their household valuables for safe keeping. According to his wife, Zura, early on the morning of December 3 Mr. Khazuyev emerged from his cellar to feed his livestock and was shot by Russian soldiers. Mrs.Khazuyeva's neighbor reportedly told her that he saw an armored personnel carrier and two cars drive up to Khazuyev's house; twenty minutes later the neighbor heard gunshots. When another villager went to find out what had happened, he found Khazuyev's body with bullet wounds. The raiding soldiers thoroughly looted Khazuyev's house and set the house on fire. Neighbors and other villagers reported to Human Rights Watch that they saw smoke emerge from Khazuyev's house. On December 15, Mrs. Khazuyeva saw the charred remains of her house. Akhanpasha Dudayev, 63 years old, was murdered on December 4. Dudayev had spent the night in his basement, together with his younger caretaker, """"Akhmed Akhmedov"""" (not the man's true name). According to """"Yakha Yakhayev"""" (not the man's true name),"""" who spoke to Akhmedov, soldiers came to Dudayev's house and threw two hand grenades into the cellar. Akhmed and Dudayev survived the blast. When the soldiers came down to the cellar, Dudayev reportedly pleaded with the soldiers, saying """"I'm an old man, don't shoot."""" Soldiers then reportedly shot Dudayev and burned his body using a gas canister. His house was looted and burned. His neighbors later collected his remains and buried them in the yard.  Kh. M. Nunayeva, age unknown, was reportedly shot by soldiers on December 4. Human Rights Watch is investigating the circumstances of his death. Isa Muradov, aged 42. He was shot on the night of December 8. According to Muradov's father, Waha (who is Alkhan-Yurt's imam), that evening he and his son were in the cellar. Isa went to the veranda, but Waha remained in the cellar, where he had been staying for the past few weeks. When Isa did not return to the cellar, his father assumed that he would see him in the morning. The next day, Waha found his son's body in the courtyard. He told Human Rights Watch that Isa's left eye was destroyed, that half of his nose had been blown off, and that he had about 30 bullets lodged in his stomach. Muradov recalled hearing a gunshot around 11:00 p.m. on the night of December 8, but feared the consequences of leaving his cellar. Isa Muradov's body lay in the courtyard for five days, as the commander of the 15th regiment, deployed in Alkhan-Yurt, at first denied Waha Muradov permission to bury his son. Musa Gilkayev, aged between 28 and 38, from Demilkhanov Street, was reportedly shot around December 8 by looting soldiers. Human Rights Watch is investigating the circumstances of his death. Ibrahim Hankurnanov, aged between 20 and 22, was reportedly killed by soldiers, although it is unclear whether he was shot or run over by an APC. Human Rights Watch is investigating the circumstances of his death.  Taus Sultanov, aged 49, was killed on the night of December 8. He wasshot by soldiers in the cellar where he was hiding with other members of his family. He was shot in the thigh and the stomach. The soldiers remained in the cellar for several hours, and Sultanov died due to lack of medical attention and blood loss. The soldiers asked demanded gold and money from the women in the cellar. Alimpasha Asuyev and Ibrahim Usmanov, aged 25 and 34. They were killed at Pushkina Streetnumber 5 on December 9. A retired policeman from the village told Human Rights Watch that he visited the scene and found the body of Usmanov lying in the courtyard just by the entrance, and Asuyev's body close behind it. But had multiple bullet wounds to the body and face. A boiled chicken was waiting on the table, suggesting the two were killed as they were preparing to eat. The retired policeman believed that the two were killed by looting soldiers.  Sultanov was buried on December 13, together in the village cemetarywith Isa Muradov, Ibrahim Usmanov, Alimpasha Asuyev and Nabitst and Arbi Kornukayeva. Military officials had refused daily requests from the villagers to bury the bodies earlier, as required by Islamic tradition.  Aindi Altimirov, aged 38, was killed on December 18 when he went out looking for a missing cow. His father recovered his beheaded body on December 19 near a just-abandoned Russian position next to the Sunzha river. His father told Human Rights Watch what he saw when he arrived at the river: """"There I saw the headless body of my son, I recognized him by his clothes. The head was found down by the river by the boys, about three meters away. There were traces at his feet, when the soldiers cut off his head he was shuffling his feet up and down [struggling] and we could see the traces in the grass. In his hand, there was grass which he had pulled out."""" Human Rights Watch has obtained photographs of the body of Altimirov which confirm he was beheaded. He was buried only on December 21, because military officials refused to allow an earlier burial as required by Islamic tradition. Nearly every Alkhan-Yurt villager interviewed by Human Rights Watch was either a victim of looting by Russian soldiers, knew of other victims, or witnessed the looting of other villagers' homes. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they watched as soldiers loaded household goods뾣urniture, clothing, refrigerators, televisions, and the like뾬nto trucks and armored personnel carriers. Many witnesses also told Human Rights Watch that Russian troops blocked access to Alkhan-Yurt and prevented villagers from leaving the village.Villagers who had fled Alkhan-Yurt prior to December 1 subsequently pleaded with the Russian command for access to the village to inspect their homes and bury their dead. One woman described how a group of villagers attempted to meet with General Vladimir Shamanov around December 11 between Kulary and Alkhan-Yurt in order to request access; Gen.Shamanov, however, chased them off the premises, reportedly threatening to shoot them should they step nearer. Other villagers were able to gain access only if they bribed Russian checkpoint soldiers.  Russian soldiers' conduct in Alkhan-Yurt violates Protocol II additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which protects, among other things, civilian immunity in internal armed conflicts. Article 4(2) forbids, inter alia, """"violence to the life, health and physical or mental well- being of persons, in particular murder. . .,"""" pillage, and """"outrages upon personal dignity."""" Human Rights Watch welcomed earlier reports tha tthe military procuracy had begun to investigate the crimes that have plainly been committed in Alkhan-Yurt. Several days ago, however, Acting Procurator General Vladimir Ustinov reported to you that no crimes had been committed in Alkhan Yurt. On Saturday, General Shamanov strenuously denied that soldiers under his command committed any wrongdoing, and made veiled threats to journalists and others who pursue the matter.  We are therefore deeply concerned that the military will not undertake an exhaustive, truly objective investigation into the crimes committed in the village and will not pursue justice against the perpetrators. We therefore urge you to allow international bodies뾦ntergovernmental and nongovernmental alike뾲o investigate the events and to grant them unfettered access to Chechnya, in particular to Alkhan-Yurt. We take this opportunity to respectfully renew our own request, lodged in November, for access to Chechnya.

A copy of the letter is below. OPEN LETTER December 22, 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Government Offices Krasnopresnenskaya Moscow, Russia Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu Ministry for Emergency Situations Teatralny Proyezd 3 Moscow, Russia Dear Sirs, I am writing to urge an immediate end to the forcible repatriation of internally displaced persons to Chechnya. Federal authorities are clearly pressuring displaced persons in Ingushetia to return to certain areas of Chechnya by denying them shelter and food. This is a serious abrogation of Russia's obligations under international law to protect civilians displaced by internal armed conflict. Human Rights Watch, a privately funded international non-governmental human rights organization, has been monitoring the human rights situation in Chechnya since before the 1994-1996 war. Since October 1999, Human Rights Watch researchers in the northern Caucasus have interviewed hundreds of civilians fleeing Chechnya. As you are no doubt aware, Russia's Northern Caucasus military command has compiled a list of twenty-four towns and villages that are under Russian control and """"safe"""" areas for the return of displaced persons. The list, undated, was signed by General V. Kazantsev, commander of the United Group of Forces for the Northern Caucasus, three other military commanders (Generals Babichev, Chaikalin, and Pankov) and Minister of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation (EMERCOM-RF) Gen. Bayramov. The events of the past week clearly demonstrate, however, that the armed conflict in Chechnya continues. Until it ends conclusively, any district could feasibly become the site of military engagement and thus endanger the lives of civilians. Civilians also face real threats to their security posed by the undisciplined and criminal conduct of some Russian troops in areas under federal control. For example, we have documented fourteen cases of summary executions of civilians by Russian soldiers in Alkhan-Yurt, and numerous cases of looting and threats of physical violence in Alkhan-Yurt and other villages in Russian-controlled Chechnya. Disregarding a principal tenet of international law governing the protection of displaced persons, beginning last week EMERCOM-RF authorities began pressuring displaced persons to return to their homes in Sernovodsk, Assinovskaya, and Achkoi-Martan. In the past few days, they began coercing displaced persons living in the Sleptsovsk-North railway car camp to relocate to the Sernovodsk displaced persons facility. Ten displaced persons in the Sletptsovsk-North railway car camp reported to Human Rights Watch researchers that on December 17, with no advance warning, the train was split into three sections and sent in three separate directions. Khamza Bekov, an EMERCOM-RF, told those living in the train who had been sent to the Sleptovsk railway station that their train would depart that day to transport them to Sernovodsk. People objected vigorously to being relocated to a war zone and removed their belongings, intending to remain in Ingushetia. In response to their protests (several women physically lay on the railroad tracks), OMON troops called by Mr. Bekov fired several shots in the air and Mr. Bekov threatened to call in Russian troops to force the civilians back on the train. On December 18, thirty-six railway cars, many of them empty, left from the Sleptovsk train station for Sernovodsk. Some of the displaced persons evicted from these wagons because they did not want to be sent to Sernovodsk were forced to sleep outside, as they have no other lodgings. Many displaced persons living in other trains in Ingushetia have told Human Rights Watch that they continue to receive notice from Russian authorities that all the trains will soon be moved to Chechnya. Also, beginning last week, many people from the towns of Sernovodsk, Assinovskaya, Achkoi Martan, and Samashki who are currently living in the Sputnik camp were told to prepare to return to Chechnya and were removed from ration lists. Human Rights Watch interviewed more than two dozen internally displaced persons in the camp whose rations had already been discontinued or would be discontinued imminently. Most of them were heads of families with children who were surviving only because of the generosity of their neighbors and camp leaders, who gave them food informally. The actions depicted above can be described only as attempts forcibly to repatriate individuals displaced by the Chechen conflict, in egregious contempt for international standards and for the dignity of displaced persons. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the principle standards governing the protection and treatment of internally displaced persons, expressly forbid forced repatriation. Principle 15 states that internally displaced persons have: (a) The right to seek safety in another part of the country; (b) the right to leave their country; (c) The right to seek asylum in another country; and (d) The right to be protected against forcible return to or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/or health would be at risk. The Guiding Principles also guarantee those displaced by the Chechen conflict the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to essential food and potable water, basic shelter and housing, appropriate clothing, essential medical services and sanitation (principle 18); and the right to access to national and international humanitarian assistance and protection (principles 24-27). In addition, articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural, to which Russia is a party, guarantee the rights to adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical care. And, Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which Russia is a party, provides for the humane treatment of all persons who do not, or no longer take an active part in the hostilities, which includes internally displaced persons. Human Rights Watch calls on your government to cease forcible returns to Chechnya and to cease using the denial of food and housing as a means to pressure displaced persons to return. No organized return of any kind should take place while the conflict is on-going inside Chechnya. We further respectfully remind your government of its international commitments to allow people safe passage to flee Chechnya, and to provide adequate humanitarian assistance in Ingushetia and neighboring republics. In the event that the Russian government is unable to provide sufficient assistance, it must accept international offers of help. It should allow international humanitarian agencies immediate, full, and unimpeded access to persons displaced from the Chechen conflict, with full security guarantees. I thank you for your attention to these concerns and welcome your response.

""""It looks like the new civilian government in Nigeria is using the same methods as the old military governments,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The new regime has made progress in some areas of human rights, but these latest events in the delta cast doubt on President Obasanjo's real intentions.""""   On November 20, at least several hundred soldiers were deployed to Odi, where a gang of armed youths had killed a dozen policemen in recent weeks. The soldiers made no apparent attempt to arrest the suspected perpetrators, and instead systematically destroyed the village over the next two weeks, leaving only three buildings undamaged. At least several dozen unarmed civilians were killed in the army operation, possibly several hundred.   In Choba, in Rivers State, on October 28 soldiers dispersed demonstrators outside the premises of Willbros Nigeria Ltd, a subsidiary of an American contractor to the oil and gas industry, based in Oklahoma. The soldiers killed four people and raped a number of women from the community. The Nigerian federal government dismissed the reports of rapes, asserting that photographs alleged to show the soldiers assaulting the women were staged, and the police have refused to investigate. Human Rights Watch found the women's claims of rape to be fully credible, and believes that contesting the accuracy of the photographic evidence is an inappropriate response by the government to serious allegations of human rights violations.   There has been increasing unrest in the Niger Delta in recent years, as local people have demanded greater control over the natural resources, chiefly oil, found beneath their land.   """"The government and oil companies have legitimate concerns over protest when it takes criminal forms. Hostage-taking or the killing of security officers deserve a serious response,"""" said Takirambudde. """"But this kind of brutality from the army is certain to make the situation worse.

The letter stated that federal authorities are denying them shelter and food as a means of pressuring displaced persons to return to Chechnya. Human Rights Watch called this a serious violation of international humanitarian law. A copy of the letter is below. OPEN LETTER December 22, 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Government Offices Krasnopresnenskaya Moscow, Russia  Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu Ministry for Emergency Situations Teatralny Proyezd 3 Moscow, Russia Dear Sirs, I am writing to urge an immediate end to the forcible repatriation of internally displaced persons to Chechnya. Federal authorities are clearly pressuring displaced persons in Ingushetia to return to certain areas of Chechnya by denying them shelter and food. This is a serious abrogation of Russia's obligations under international law to protect civilians displaced by internal armed conflict. Human Rights Watch, a privately funded international non-governmental human rights organization, has been monitoring the human rights situation in Chechnya since before the 1994-1996 war. Since October 1999, Human Rights Watch researchers in the northern Caucasus have interviewed hundreds of civilians fleeing Chechnya.  As you are no doubt aware, Russia's Northern Caucasus military command has compiled a list of twenty-four towns and villages that are under Russian control and """"safe"""" areas for the return of displaced persons. The list, undated, was signed by General V. Kazantsev, commander of the United Group of Forces for the Northern Caucasus, three other military commanders (Generals Babichev, Chaikalin, and Pankov) and Minister of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation (EMERCOM-RF) Gen. Bayramov. The events of the past week clearly demonstrate, however, that the armed conflict in Chechnya continues. Until it ends conclusively, any district could feasibly become the site of military engagement and thus endanger the lives of civilians. Civilians also face real threats to their security posed by the undisciplined and criminal conduct of some Russian troops in areas under federal control. For example, we have documented fourteen cases of summary executions of civilians by Russian soldiers in Alkhan-Yurt, and numerous cases of looting and threats of physical violence in Alkhan-Yurt and other villages in Russian-controlled Chechnya. Disregarding a principal tenet of international law governing the protection of displaced persons, beginning last week EMERCOM-RF authorities began pressuring displaced persons to return to their homes in Sernovodsk, Assinovskaya, and Achkoi-Martan. In the past few days, they began coercing displaced persons living in the Sleptsovsk-North railway car camp to relocate to the Sernovodsk displaced persons facility. Ten displaced persons in the Sletptsovsk-North railway car camp reported to Human Rights Watch researchers that on December 17, with no advance warning, the train was split into three sections and sent in three separate directions. Khamza Bekov, an EMERCOM-RF, told those living in the train who had been sent to the Sleptovsk railway station that their train would depart that day to transport them to Sernovodsk. People objected vigorously to being relocated to a war zone and removed their belongings, intending to remain in Ingushetia. In response to their protests (several women physically lay on the railroad tracks), OMON troops called by Mr. Bekov fired several shots in the air and Mr. Bekov threatened to call in Russian troops to force the civilians back on the train. On December 18, thirty-six railway cars, many of them empty, left from the Sleptovsk train station for Sernovodsk. Some of the displaced persons evicted from these wagons because they did not want to be sent to Sernovodsk were forced to sleep outside, as they have no other lodgings. Many displaced persons living in other trains in Ingushetia have told Human Rights Watch that they continue to receive notice from Russian authorities that all the trains will soon be moved to Chechnya. Also, beginning last week, many people from the towns of Sernovodsk, Assinovskaya, Achkoi Martan, and Samashki who are currently living in the Sputnik camp were told to prepare to return to Chechnya and were removed from ration lists. Human Rights Watch interviewed more than two dozen internally displaced persons in the camp whose rations had already been discontinued or would be discontinued imminently. Most of them were heads of families with children who were surviving only because of the generosity of their neighbors and camp leaders, who gave them food informally. The actions depicted above can be described only as attempts forcibly to repatriate individuals displaced by the Chechen conflict, in egregious contempt for international standards and for the dignity of displaced persons. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the principle standards governing the protection and treatment of internally displaced persons, expressly forbid forced repatriation. Principle 15 states that internally displaced persons have: (a) The right to seek safety in another part of the country; (b) the right to leave their country; (c) The right to seek asylum in another country; and (d) The right to be protected against forcible return to or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/or health would be at risk. The Guiding Principles also guarantee those displaced by the Chechen conflict the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to essential food and potable water, basic shelter and housing, appropriate clothing, essential medical services and sanitation (principle 18); and the right to access to national and international humanitarian assistance and protection (principles 24-27). In addition, articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural, to which Russia is a party, guarantee the rights to adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical care. And, Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which Russia is a party, provides for the humane treatment of all persons who do not, or no longer take an active part in the hostilities, which includes internally displaced persons. Human Rights Watch calls on your government to cease forcible returns to Chechnya and to cease using the denial of food and housing as a means to pressure displaced persons to return. No organized return of any kind should take place while the conflict is on-going inside Chechnya. We further respectfully remind your government of its international commitments to allow people safe passage to flee Chechnya, and to provide adequate humanitarian assistance in Ingushetia and neighboring republics. In the event that the Russian government is unable to provide sufficient assistance, it must accept international offers of help. It should allow international humanitarian agencies immediate, full, and unimpeded access to persons displaced from the Chechen conflict, with full security guarantees. I thank you for your attention to these concerns and welcome your response.

""""The European Union must couple its efforts to make China a more reliable trading partner with serious parallel pressure for significant improvements in human rights,"""" said Lotte Leicht, Brussels Office director of Human Rights Watch. """"China must go beyond opening its markets to opening its jails, easing restrictions on the press and the Internet, and protecting the rights of workers. The dialogue can be most beneficial for human rights in China if it is combined with effective, sustained pressure for greater political as well as economic freedoms in the country.""""   The summit is expected to focus on the EU's negotiations with China on its membership in the World Trade Organizatin (WTO). But Human Rights Watch noted that there has been a serious deterioration in human rights conditions in China since the last EU-China summit, including an intensified crackdown on pro-democracy activists, the banning of the Falun Gong movement, and repression in Tibet and Xinjiang.   The international human rights monitor called on the EU to insist that Chinese leaders take concrete, meaningful steps to improve human rights. At a minimum, the Chinese should:   ratify the two United Nations human rights treaties it has signed, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; begin the process of dismantling the huge system of """"reeducation through labor"""" which allows officials to sentence thousands of citizens to labor camps each year for up to three years without judicial review; open up Tibet and Xinjiang to regular, unhindered access by U.N. human rights and humanitarian agencies, foreign press, and independent monitors; review the sentences of more than 2,000 """"counter-revolutionaries"""" convicted under a provision repealed in 1997, with a view towards releasing most of them. lift the official ban on Falun Gong and release all those members of Falun Gong who have been arbitrarily detained or sentenced to labor camps. A critical source of external pressure on Beijing is the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which convenes in Geneva for its next session on March 20, 2000. In the past, China has shown that it can be extraordinarily sensitive to possible condemnation by the Commission. In 1995, a resolution on China came within one vote of passing, and since then Beijing has expended major effort worldwide to keep any critical resolution off the Commission's agenda -- including by threatening to cut off trade deals or investment opportunities to governments that might support action.   Human Rights Watch called on the EU to join the U.S. and other major trading partners in sponsoring a resolution on China at next year's U.N. meeting. But if action in Geneva is to have any chance of success next year, a decision to sponsor a resolution and begin high-level lobbying to line up support is needed now.   """"Beijing's chief trading partners must insist that China's compliance with international trade rules be accompanied by respect for international human rights rules,"""" said Ms. Leicht.

Human Rights Watch has had a team of researchers interviewing Chechen refugees in Ingushetia since early November.   The letter to the U.N. Security Council is below.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   OPEN LETTER   December 20, 1999   H.E. Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock President of U.N. Security Council Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom to the U.N. 885 Second Avenue New York, NY 10017   Your Excellency Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock:   We call on the Security Council as a matter of urgency to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate violations of the laws of war by Russian forces operating in Chechnya. In light of growing reports of indiscriminate and disproportionate fire endangering the lives of civilians, as well as reports of summary executions and other serious human rights violations, we believe that the United Nations has a duty to send a clear signal that those responsible for such violations will be brought to justice and must act to preserve a record of the violations for future prosecution. To do anything less is to condemn the Caucasus region to a perpetual cycle of violence as each new generation of victims seeks its own form of justice. Because we believe that investigations of this sort should examine the conduct of all waring parties, we urge you to include Chechen forces within the scope of the inquiry.   Human Rights Watch, a privately funded international non-governmental human rights organization, has been monitoring the human rights situation in Chechnya since before the 1994-1996 war. Since October 1999, Human Rights Watch researchers in the northern Caucasus have interviewed hundreds of civilians fleeing Chechnya. Our findings confirm that the conduct of Russia's military campaign in Chechnya continues to take a terrible toll on civilians. Russian forces have bombed and shelled dozens of towns and villages still inhabited by civilians, actions that have killed and maimed untold numbers of people and shown contempt for international humanitarian law. Civilians able to reach the Ingush border faced long waits—sometimes for days—in freezing weather while Russian border police """"process."""" Currently, border closures at times appear entirely arbitrary, and some border police continue to extort bribes as a condition for permission to cross. Russian authorities are also denying food and shelter to displaced persons in Ingushetia to pressure them to return to certain Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya. Russian forces have consistently failed to provide civilians safe exit routes out of the conflict zones, despite their claims to the contrary, forcing them either to remain in villages under siege or risk getting shot as they flee.   Soldiers in Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya apparently have carte blanche to loot and pillage; many people have returned briefly to their homes to find them stripped bare of household goods and other valuables. Displaced persons also reported summary executions by Russian soliders after the capture of the town of Alkhan-Yurt. Our information indicates that at least seventeen persons, and possibly many more, were killed—many of them summarily executed—between December 1-9, 1999.   Human Rights Watch has urged a number of steps by the international community to bring pressure on the Russian government to comply with its international commitments in its conduct in Chechnya, including by calling on international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to withhold disbursement of upcoming loan tranches and to link future disbursement to the Russian government's conduct in Chechnya.   However, we believe that the United Nations has a distinctive role to play not only in bringing an end to the current violence but beginning the process of truth and justice that is a prerequisite for long-term peace in the region. To date, the international community has refused to insist on accountability for serious human rights violations committed in Chechnya. During the 1994-96 war, the international community, including the U.N., repeatedly condemned the atrocities committed by Russian forces in Chechnya, but remained silent when the Russian government refused to investigate or prosecute those responsible. This failure of international policy helped to perpetuate an environment of impunity that facilitates abuses in the current conflict.   We believe that the United Nations has a unique opportunity to end the pervading sense of impunity for war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law that exists among Russian forces operating in Chechnya. The United Nations has a duty at a minimum to send a clear message to the Russian government and armed forces that they are bound to comply with international humanitarian law and that the United Nation will respond with more than rhetorical condemnation of those who violate these obligations. The establishment of an international commission of inquiry to examine and analyse the evidence of violations of the laws of war is a particularly important step because it may deter at least some of the atrocities and thereby save the lives of innocent civilians, as well as preserve the historical record to facilitate the future prosecution of those who have already committed serious violations.   At the opening of the current session of the General Assembly, Secretary General Kofi Annan challenged the Security Council and the U.N. as a whole not to allow massive and systematic violations of human rights—regardless of where they occurr. We hope that the Council will now take on this challenge in Chechnya. We recognize that establishing a commission of inquiry by the Security Council would require the Russian government to abstain from voting on such a resolution, and we are calling on the Russian government to do so (see attached letter). We trust, however, that the other members of the Council will support this move and that no permanent member will use its veto power for parochial reasons. Should the Security Council be unable to fulfill the most basic of the U.N.'s founding principles—to save generations from the scourge of war, reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, and establish conditions under which justice can prevail—we will call on the General Assembly to create a commission of inquiry to examine and evaluate the evidence of serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law during the conflict in Chechnya.

Yet many people told Human Rights Watch that they fear bombardment and undisciplined conduct by Russian soldiers in their towns. They also lack the materials to repair homes damaged by war. In some cases, their homes have also been thoroughly looted.

Beginning last week, thousands of people from the towns of Sernovodsk, Assinovskaya, and Achkoi Martan -- in the flatlands of Russian-controlled northern Chechnya -- were told to prepare to return, and were removed from government ration lists. Yet many people told Human Rights Watch that they fear bombardment and undisciplined conduct by Russian soldiers in their towns. They also lack the materials to repair homes damaged by war. In some cases, their homes have also been thoroughly looted. """"To forcibly repatriate people back to a war zone is a serious violation of their rights,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The displaced people in Ingushetia must be allowed to make their own decisions about going home."""" Russia's Northern Caucasus military command has compiled a list of twenty-four towns and villages that are under Russian control and """"safe"""" areas for the return of displaced persons. The list, undated, was signed by General V. Kazantsev, commander of the United Group of Forces for the Northern Caucasus and by four other top commanders. Human Rights Watch researchers working in Ingushetia have seen a copy of the document. Sharvani Khuchbarov, the head of the Sputnik camp for displaced person in Ingushetia, explained to Human Rights Watch that Russian generals were guaranteeing the security of these towns. """"We're proposing to [the refugees] that they go back to their homes. It's not a matter of whether they want or don't want to go back -- why wouldn't you want to go back to your very own home?"""" Asked why camp administrators were discontinuing the food rations of some displaced persons, Khuchbarov, whose camp currently houses about 9,000 people, told Human Rights Watch, """"Why should we continue to feed them?

Between February 1998 and April 1999, they are alleged to have collected money from ethnic Albanians in Belgrade to purchase weapons, ammunition, and propagandistic material for the KLA.

The refugees should also be allowed to choose freely whether to return from the camps in West Timor, the report said. An estimated 75,000 to 110,000 refugees are still in the camps, three months after most were forcibly expelled following a ballot on self-determination in East Timor. """"Thousands of East Timorese are effectively being held hostage by the very same militias that drove them from their homes in the first place,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch.   International donors will be attending a World Bank-convened meeting in Tokyo on December 17 to discuss the future development of an independent East Timor. Saunders urged the donors to put the refugees at the top of their agenda. """"Now is the time for concerted international pressure on Indonesia to get the militias out and allow the civilian refugees to return,"""" said Saunders. Many of those who will be present at the meeting are also major donors to Indonesia.   The 19-page report, East Timor: Forced Expulsions to West Timor and the Refugee Crisis, is based on interviews with more than one hundred East Timorese returnees in transit centers in Dili, the capital of East Timor. It documents the continuing obstacles to return for East Timorese refugees in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia. The obstacles include death threats against families seeking to leave, attacks on convoys heading back for East Timor, militia-spread disinformation portraying East Timor as a desperate and dangerous place, and the presence in the camps of militia leaders believed to be responsible for attacks on civilians earlier in the year.   In the report, Human Rights Watch also sets forth new testimonial and documentary evidence that the expulsions were the result of a planned, systematic campaign coordinated by the Indonesian military. The report notes that the process of expulsion was highly similar from one end of East Timor to the other, and draws on eyewitness accounts of direct military involvement in the expulsions and military facilitation of militia campaigns of terror and intimidation of East Timorese. In many cases, district military command posts served as way stations for East Timorese civilians forced from their homes and subsequently transported to West Timor. This was not a case of evacuation of selected loyalists.   Human Rights Watch urged that international investigators preparing for a possible international tribunal should undertake more intensive gathering of evidence, including investigation of militia leaders whose whereabouts in the camps is known. The tribunal would prosecute crimes against humanity committed in the run-up to and immediately following the vote in East Timor.   On August 30, almost 80 percent of East Timor's eligible voters chose independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored referendum. Within days, the tiny half-island had become what one diplomat described as a """"living hell."""" Army-backed militia members, armed with automatic weapons, launched a scorched-earth policy, targeting independence supporters for death; looting and burning homes, clinics, churches, and stores; and forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. U.N. agencies estimated that three-quarters of the population was displaced, including an estimated 200,000 people to West Timor, most of whom had been forcibly expelled from East Timor by militia members who have continued to terrorize and target them there.   Although more than 100,000 refugees have already returned and many of those still left may be associated with Indonesian rule and may not wish to return, there are likely thousands of others who have not yet been able to make a free and informed choice.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/12/16/cluster-bombs-memorandum-convention-conventional-weapons-ccw-delegates","Cluster Bombs- Memorandum For Convention on Conventional Weapons CCW Delegates","Cluster Bombs: Memorandum For Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) Delegates","","12/16/1999","Human Rights Watch is calling for a global moratorium on the use of cluster bombs(1) until humanitarian concerns can be adequately addressed. The conflict in Kosovo earlier this year has drawn unprecedented attention to the dangers posed to civilians by cluster bombs. On 11 May 1999, Human Rights Watch called for a halt to use of cluster bombs by NATO forces (see, HRW report, """"Ticking Time Bombs: NATO's Use of Cluster Munitions in Yugoslavia""""). When the submunitions contained inside cluster bombs fail to explode as intended, they become in effect antipersonnel landmines. Because of the high """"dud,"""" or failure, rate of the submunitions, and because of the large number typically dispersed over large areas, they have proven to be a serious and long-lasting threat to civilians, soldiers, peacekeepers, and even clearance experts. Since the conflict ended, it is estimated that more than 100 civilians have been killed or injured by the cluster bomb duds dropped by U.S. and U.K. aircraft. Ten days after the KFOR multinational force deployed to Kosovo, two British soldiers were killed by cluster bomb duds while engaged in clearance operations. Some 600 cluster bomb sites have been identified across Kosovo. U.S. and U.K. cluster bomb duds have been as much a problem for civilians and clearance specialists as landmines laid by Yugoslav forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. During Operation Allied Force, the U.S. dropped about 1,100 CBU-87 cluster bombs (each containing 202 submunitions) and the U.K. dropped about 500 RBL-755 cluster bombs (each containing 147 submunitions). Using a very conservative estimate of 5% failure rate, NATO forces left behind nearly 15,000 duds, waiting, like antipersonnel mines, to take lives and limbs during peacetime. In addition to the post-conflict casualties, Human Rights Watch believes there were nine to fourteen cluster bomb attacks resulting in civilian casualties during the conflict, causing an estimated 90-150 civilian deaths, or 15-26% of all civilian deaths, even though the 1,600 cluster bombs dropped represented just 6% of weapons expended in the air war. A NATO airstrike involving cluster bombs on an airfield in Nis on 7 May went off target, hitting a hospital complex and adjoining civilian areas. On 24 April , five boys were reported to have been killed and two injured when what was evidently a cluster bomb submunition exploded near the village of Daganovic. Human Rights Watch has learned that in mid-May, President Clinton issued a directive prohibiting further cluster bomb use in the conflict -- indicating perhaps both a recognition of the humanitarian impact, and the lack of necessity to use the weapon to accomplish the military objectives. In doing so, the president has set a precedent for restricting cluster bomb use. Indeed, recognizing the danger to civilians, air combat commander Maj. Gen. Michael Ryan (now U.S. Air Force chief of staff) decided during Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia in 1995 to prohibit cluster bomb use. Human Rights Watch previously documented that about 1,220 Kuwaiti and 400 Iraqi civilians were killed by an estimated 1.2 million cluster bomb duds following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, which saw the most extensive use of cluster bombs in history. It is clear that at the present time, the use of even the most sophisticated cluster bombs poses grave and unacceptable dangers to civilian populations. There should be no further use until governments can establish either that a technical solution is possible or that new restrictions and requirements regarding use can be effective. There should be no use of cluster bombs by any nation until: a definitive study is made of various ways of minimizing the impact of cluster bombs on civilian populations . This should include an examination of technical possibilities and options related to use and targeting. there is adequate research and analysis of past use of cluster bombs, including military usefulness, civilian impact, safety and overall effects. there is a serious legal review of cluster bombs and their consistency with international humanitarian law. This should include an assessment of whether they are inherently indiscriminate, prone to indiscriminate use, excessively injurious, cause unnecessary suffering, have a disproportionate impact on civilians compared to their military utility, or violate the dictates of public conscience. On the technical side, HRW believes cluster bombs should not be used until it can be demonstrated that the failure rate of cluster bombs can be reduced to a tolerable level from a humanitarian perspective. That level should be determined by humanitarian and military experts, but should certainly be less than 1%. As part of the research effort, there needs to be: a realistic assessment of the failure rate of existing cluster bombs, which is often estimated anywhere from 2%-30%. There should also be an assessment if cluster bombs have a higher failure rate than other weapons that become unexploded ordnance, and if unexploded cluster bomblets are more volatile or dangerous than other UXO. an examination of options to improve the reliability and safety of cluster bombs, and of the factors that affect cluster bomb reliability and safety (including fuses and secondary fuses, number of bomblets, area coverage, dispersal pattern, method and circumstances of delivery, special features (like incendiary rings), characteristics of the target area, age and design). an assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of putting self-destruct, self-neutralizing and/or self-deactivating mechanisms on all cluster bombs, both new production and existing stocks. On the use side, HRW believes there needs to be: an identification of what constitutes a proper and effective use of cluster bombs. a prohibition on use in populated or urban areas. an assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of various other potential restrictions on use aimed at avoiding collateral damage, including target limitations and high-altitude delivery. a requirement for accurate recording and mapping of cluster bomb use. post-use requirements such as marking, warnings to civilians, and clearance. Human Rights Watch asks that governments address this urgent humanitarian issue both domestically and at the international level. Consideration should be given to utilizing the Convention on Conventional Weapons as a means of establishing rules, restrictions, requirements, and/or prohibitions with respect to cluster bombs and their use that would minimize the dangers to and impact on civilian populations. 1. 1 For the purposes of this memorandum, HRW is using """"cluster bomb"""" as a short-hand, catch-all term for air- and surface-delivered dispensers containing unguided explosive submunitions.","","Arms"

In a letter to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Human Rights Watch called on the Bank to withhold a pending $100 million payment under a structural adjustment loan to the Russian Federation. Describing indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing, looting, and extrajudicial executions committed by Russian forces in Chechnya, the letter states that if the Bank made the payment to the Russian Central Bank for general budgetary spending, it would be implicated in these abuses.

The International Monetary Fund recently delayed payment of $640 million to Russia. Officially, the decision was based on economic factors, but widely believed to be linked to the Chechnya conflict.

They are facing the Russian forces' ultimatum that they leave the city or face imminent """"destruction"""" together with Chechen rebels, yet they have not been able to flee due to on-going aerial bombardment and limited means of transportation. The current lull in the shelling has allowed some Grozny residents to flee to safety. However, hanging in the balance is the fate of those who remain and may be unable to leave due to their personal circumstances --- the elderly, the infirm, and the poor. The Russian government maintains that it is conducting an """"anti-terrorist"""" operation in Chechnya, prompted by the terrorist bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, and incursions by Chechen militants into Dagestan. Of course, the aspiration of fearing no one belongs to Russian citizens of Moscow, Volgodonsk and Dagestan, as well as those of Chechnya. No one doubts the right, and indeed responsibility, of the Russian government to protect its citizens from terrorism. But the actions of Russian forces in Chechnya have gone far beyond anti-terrorist measures and have had a severe impact on the civilian population of Chechnya. Russia is today a party to an internal armed conflict, and must observe its obligations under the Geneva Conventions and other international humanitarian law that regulates such conflicts. To date, in Chechnya, Russian forces have flouted these standards. Human Rights Watch researchers in the northern Caucasus have interviewed hundreds of civilians fleeing Chechnya. Our findings confirm that the conduct of Russia's military campaign in Chechnya continues to take a terrible toll on civilians. Russian forces have bombed and shelled dozens of towns and villages still inhabited by civilians, actions that have killed and maimed untold numbers of people and shown contempt for international humanitarian law. They have consistently failed to provide civilians safe exit routes out of the conflict zones, forcing them either to remain in villages under siege or risk getting shot on the road. Civilians able to reach the border crossings often face long waits, sometimes up to days, in freezing weather while Russian border police """"process"""" them and extort bribes as a condition for permitting them to cross. Displaced persons in Ingushetia face serious protection problems and acute, sometimes life-threatening, lack of basic humanitarian assistance.  Soldiers in Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya apparently have carte blanche to strip homes of household goods and valuables; many people have returned briefly to their homes to find them looted bare. In the village of Alkan-Yurt, Russian forces went on a rampage, killing several of the homeowners who resisted the looting and burning some homes in the village after looting them. The testimony of displaced persons from the town summarized in the attached statement indicates that at least twenty-three persons, and possibly many more, were summarily executed in the town between December 1-9, 1999. The Russian military authorities appear to have little interest in stopping abuses by their forces, and have allowed a culture of impunity to develop in Chechnya. If the Bank pays the forthcoming installment on its structural adjustment loan, it will be implicated in this human suffering and held accountable by citizens of the world who are in fact its ultimate shareholders. As a direct payment to the Russian Central Bank for purposes of general budgetary spending, there is a clear danger that World Bank funds will fuel the military engine at work in Chechnya. Even were there agreed restrictions imposed on the use of Bank funds in order to safeguard against such allocation, the Bank would nonetheless be complicit in abuses in Chechnya, as its support would free up other Russian government resources to fund the war effort. For this reason alone, the Bank must refuse payment on the loan. Moreover, the Bank should withhold payment and press the Russian government to cease the violations in Chechnya, because they only serve to exacerbate the already considerable development challenges facing the country. As you have frequently recognized, achieving sustainable economic development is only more complicated and difficult in a post-conflict situation. The current conflict in Chechnya is at least in part a function of the failure of post-conflict reconstruction in the province following the 1994-96 war. As the current Russian assault escalates, the prospective cost of physically rebuilding Chechnya, not to mention creating credible and effective governmental structures capable of assuring good governance and security to its citizens, mounts to staggering proportions. Finally, the Bank should take a stand against the Russian government's actions in Chechnya, because they violate international humanitarian law and reflect a broader disrespect for Russia's international commitments. A government should not be considered a reliable investment partner if it undertakes specific commitments and then blatantly abrogates them, as the Russian government has done at the OSCE summit in Istanbul and in subsequent weeks, with respect to the promised visit of the Chairman-in-office to Chechnya and the role of the OSCE Assistance Group. There is a global system of international law that encompasses the Geneva Conventions and other humanitarian norms as well as international financial agreements; the Russian Federation should not be allowed to pick and choose among its commitments. The Bank's Articles of Agreement and its loan agreement with Russia must be interpreted in the context of this broader international legal framework. Given the Bank's origins and purposes, there must be an implied understanding in any Bank undertaking that it cannot be allowed through its financing to become complicit in the kinds of violations of international law being perpetrated by Russian armed forces in Chechnya, nor for that matter, to underwrite conduct that is so contrary to its fundamental development goals. Put another way, the Bank is required to weigh only """"economic considerations,"""" but it is further required to do so in a manner consistent with its core purpose. Much has been made of the risk of alienating the Russian government from western institutions if a strong stand is taken against the violence in Chechnya. As we emphasized at the outset, however, a stand can be taken against the methods used in Chechnya, without objecting to the legitimate and politically popular goal of eliminating the scourge of terrorism.  Moreover, allow us to observe in closing that the Russian misperception that they are being treated unfairly by the international community is only likely to be worsened by obvious obfuscation such as that undertaken recently by the IMF, which withheld funds for one set of stated reasons when everyone including the Russian people knows well that it is another. The more credible and effective course is to clearly articulate the real conditions for continued financial support, which should in this case be a clear and verifiable commitment on the part of the Russian government to abide by international law in Chechnya, specifically desisting from attacks on heavily populated areas; implementing well-publicized cease-fires along exit routes to allow civilians to flee; and allowing unfettered access and necessary security for international observers and that of humanitarian organizations seeking to provide relief in Chechnya.

In a letter to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Human Rights Watch called on the Bank to withhold a pending $100 million payment under a structural adjustment loan to the Russian Federation. Describing indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing, looting, and extrajudicial executions committed by Russian forces in Chechnya, the letter states that if the Bank made the payment to the Russian Central Bank for general budgetary spending, it would be implicated in these abuses.   """"The bank shouldn't finance the abusive and destructive conduct we are seeing in Chechnya,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Russia's campaign in Chechnya violates international law and undermines development, and the Bank should have no part of it.""""   Roth said Human Rights Watch was equally concerned about another $100 million pending for payment from the Japanese government, as well as the prospect of private financing for Russia's campaign.   The International Monetary Fund recently delayed payment of $640 million to Russia. Officially, the decision was based on economic factors, but widely believed to be linked to the Chechnya conflict. In the wake of the IMF decision, news sources reported the Russian government was considering alternative funding sources, including a bond issue targeting foreign investors.   A copy of the letter from Human Rights Watch to World Bank President James Wolfensohn is attached.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   December 14, 1999   OPEN LETTER   Mr. James Wolfensohn President The World Bank 1818 H Street, NW Washington, DC 20433   Re: Structural Adjustment Loan Disbursement to Russia in Light of Conduct of Russian Forces in Chechnya   Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:   We are writing to you with the utmost urgency to ask you to withhold payment of the forthcoming $100 million disbursement under the Bank's structural adjustment loan to the Russian Federation, and to use your relationship with representatives of the Russian government to press for an end to the abuses being committed in Chechnya, making clear that any future disbursements will be linked to the Russian government's compliance with its international commitments in its conduct in Chechnya.   We understand of course that the Bank is constrained by its Articles of Agreement, as well as its loan agreement with the Russian Federation. As is elaborated below, however, we cannot accept that these restrictions could be read to require the Bank to finance a government engaged in activities that so clearly violate international law and undermine the Bank's fundamental development goals as is currently the case in Russia.   We have welcomed your leadership in recent years in guiding the Bank toward full appreciation of the important """"human aspects"""" of development.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/12/15/remarks-kenneth-roth-executive-director-human-rights-watch-introducing-hrws-world","Remarks of Kenneth Roth Executive Director of Human Rights Watch introducing HRWs World Report 1999","Remarks of Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, introducing HRW's World Report 1999","","12/15/1999","This year's World Report marks Human Rights Watch's 20th anniversary. It reviews developments in 68 countries. I will highlight a few of the trends of the last year. In addition, because this is the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I will look at some of the remarkable developments of the past half century. How does one celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration in a decade marked by genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda? Progress is obvious in much of Latin America, the former Soviet bloc, southern Africa, and in parts of Asia. But how can we open the champagne bottles when terrible abuses persists in so many countries? What can be acclaimed in this anniversary year is the emergence of a powerful movement to deter such abuses -- a movement that makes it far more likely that human rights abuse will be identified, written about in the press, criticized, cited as a justification for cutting off aid or trade, and possibly used as evidence in an international criminal trial. This movement has produced a dramatic transformation in the way that governments treat their citizens and each other. First of all, for years, dictatorial governments regularly rejected criticism of their human rights records as """"interference"""" in their """"internal affairs."""" Pressure from other governments to end abuse was rare. Today, human rights are well established as the legitimate concern of all humanity. Governments regularly comment on each other's rights practices and make respect for rights an important factor in their aid relationships. Even China, one of the last holdouts, has accepted the legitimacy of international scrutiny by signing two major rights treaties and, this year, even protesting human rights abuses against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Second, the Universal Declaration has come to protect a far broader range of people. For many years, it was applied primarily for the benefit of political dissidents and opponents. Today, it is widely understood to benefit not only political activists but also women facing discrimination or violence, refugees, civilians caught in conflict, children, common prisoners, gays and lesbians, religious minorities, workers, as well as those seeking economic, social and cultural rights. Third, driving these developments has been a veritable explosion in the size and strength of the human rights movement. The Helsinki accords of 1975 affirmed """"the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights,"""" and helped launch the human rights movement in the Soviet bloc. Also in the 1970s, human rights groups emerged in Asia and Latin America to challenge abuses by authoritarian governments. Today, human rights organizations have established a firm presence in all but the most repressive countries. Fourth, moving to the current year, the most dramatic change has been a substantial strengthening of the international system for bringing the most heinous human rights criminals to justice. Key developments include the arrest of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet, the enthusiastic adoption of a treaty to establish an International Criminal Court, and the substantial progress made by the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Both the Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals seem to have overcome their early problems. Each has numerous defendants in custody and several trials underway, including yesterday's arrest of Bosnian Serb General Krstic, who is accused of playing a major role in the Srebrenica massacre. The main obstacle to the success of the Yugoslav tribunal remains NATO's unwillingness to arrest former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. It is time for NATO to act. The International Criminal Court, which will provide a forum to prosecute the world's worst human rights offenders, will be weaker than it might have been because of opposition from the United States, China, India and others. But it still will have considerable power to bring to justice those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. Today, the biggest challenge is to hold the line in the face of Washington's continuing efforts to undermine the agreement reached in July in Rome. The ICC will assume jurisdiction only if national courts are unable or unwilling to try the most serious human rights offenders. So, the United States, with its strong justice system, has little to fear. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has been determined to oppose a court with even a theoretical possibility of prosecuting an American. Its vision of partial justice is, for most of the world, injustice. The arrest and proposed extradition of Pinochet is a tremendously important step which has broken the ice and may finally make powerful governments willing to break the cycle of impunity that so frequently encourages atrocities. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration, through its prolonged silence followed by its misguided plea for deference to Pinochet's self-granted amnesty, is increasingly seen as opposing justice. Justice will not disrupt transitions to democracy or make it more difficult to encourage abusive officials to relinquish power. Chile's current president felt so confident in the strength of Chilean democracy that at the height of the Pinochet drama he left the country for nine days on a trade mission. Dictators give up power not because they are born-again democrats but because their domestic and international support has waned. Prosecutions, by delegitimizing tyrants, can hasten that process. International justice will also not, as some fear, endanger democratic leaders with a few human rights peccadillos to their record. The concept of universal jurisdiction that lies behind the Pinochet prosecution applies only to the most severe human rights offenses - genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. With so much renewed interest in justice for the atrocities of the past, it will only be a matter of time before other tyrants face their day in court. That will be an important step toward preventing such crimes in the future. Let me turn to our evaluation of U.S. policy on human rights. The Clinton administration's efforts to promote human rights around the world were subject to large blind spots. Major parts of the globe never made it onto the administration's human rights agenda. The administration did best with the pariah countries -- Burma, Belarus, Sierra Leone, Sudan. It also performed well on some more pivotal countries, such as Croatia, Malaysia, Algeria, and Indonesia. In some countries, the administration's record was mixed. It waited far too long as Yugoslav forces battered ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo. But then, it brought NATO military pressure to bear until Yugoslav President Milosevic agreed, at least for the time being, to stop the attacks, withdraw some troops, and permit international monitoring. In Bosnia, U.S. troops helped NATO to arrest lesser war crimes suspects but, to our continuing disappointment, not the leaders of the genocide. In Colombia, the administration openly acknowledged the close working relationship between the army and murderous paramilitary forces. But the new U.S. ambassador has been silent on human rights. And the administration implemented half-heartedly and with no transparency the Leahy Amendment which requires it to withhold assistance from forces involved in abuse until they bring those responsible to justice. In Cuba, while ostensibly concerned about human rights, the U.S. government pursued an embargo that itself violated the rights to freedom of expression and movement. Moreover, by adopting an all-or-nothing approach to President Fidel Castro's continuing rule, Washington provided little incentive for him to ease repression of civil society. In China, the administration helped to enhance dialogue about human rights; to convince the government to sign a key human rights treaty; to secure the release of a handful of prisoners; and to gain permission for President Clinton, during his visit to the country, to speak to the public about human rights. It also pushed, albeit unsuccessfully, for more systematic changes. But the administration had no plan, other than waiting for China to change on its own, for helping to move beyond promises and dialogue to systematic change. Washington gave up two powerful sources of leverage--human rights preconditions to President Clinton's much-sought trip to China, and efforts to secure a resolution critical of China before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights--without developing any alternative way to keep the pressure on. We've seen the results of China's empty promises to respect human rights in its arrest this week of Xu Wenli and his allies for trying to form an independent political party. Vast swaths of the globe were largely exempt from U.S. pressure on human rights. These included most of Central Asia and the Middle East, where oil interests stood in the way of strong human rights advocacy. In Africa, the United States favored strategic alliances with new leaders to paying attention to their human rights problems. The administration remained publicly silent about severe government abuses in Rwanda and the Congo as well as abuses by the Sudan People's Liberation Army. And President Clinton seemed to lower the bar in assessing Uganda's and Nigeria's lack of democracy. This inconsistency in U.S. support for human rights, and the frequent subordination of human rights to so many other interests, threatens to weaken what should be a strong voice for the human rights cause. The Clinton administration also continued to refuse to accept an unconditional ban on anti-personnel landmines. And it continued to obstruct efforts to ban the use of children under 18 years of age as soldiers. The use of child soldiers -- an estimated 300,000 worldwide -- contributes significantly to the inhumanity of war. The children themselves risk death, physical injury, and deep psychological scars while, because of their lack of maturity, they endanger those who encounter them. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by every country in the world except Somalia, which has no functioning government, and the United States. It sets 18 as the age of maturity on most other matters, and there is a broad international consensus that this bright red line should be used to define the appropriate age of soldiers. But because the Pentagon recruits 17-year-olds out of high school, the U.S. government refuses to join a proposed protocol barring the recruitment of anyone younger than 18. Indeed, by blocking a """"consensus,"""" the Clinton administration refuses to permit anyone else to adopt the protocol for themselves--even though 17-year-olds constitute just 4 percent of active-duty American recruits, and less than ½ of 1 percent of active-duty American soldiers. Washington thus has elevated a matter of incremental recruiting convenience over the humanitarian imperative of curbing this cruel and dangerous aspect of warfare. The European Union fared somewhat better than the United States in promoting human rights. Of particular note is its policy of explicitly conditioning its aid and trade relationships on respect for human rights. Unfortunately, it was not always consistent in upholding this conditionality. For example, it applied conditionality productively in the cases of Cuba and Burma, but was too quick to give it up in the case of Serbia and Tunisia. The E.U. also undermined conditionality by signing a trade agreement with Turkmenistan and moving toward ratifying an agreement with Uzbekistan -- two of Central Asia's most repressive regimes. The E.U. adopted an important code of conduct limiting arms sales to abusive governments, but its members still scrambled to sell arms to Turkey. We also expressed concern that the E.U.'s preference for consensus in its foreign policy might stand in the way of the more active promotion of human rights by some of its members. And we criticized the E.U. for mounting improper barriers to refugees seeking asylum in Europe. At the United Nations, Kofi Annan has shown a greater commitment to human rights than any other U.N. secretary-general. He has been an outspoken defender of human rights, and made serious efforts to integrate human rights into all U.N. activities. UNICEF made the most progress in this regard, while UNDP and UNHCR lagged. Mary Robinson, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, took great strides toward reinvigorating an office that had retreated into the irrelevance of quiet diplomacy under its first occupant. She was at her best on Algeria, Rwanda, and Colombia - outspoken and tough. But much work remains to transform the high commissioner's office into an effective vehicle for defending human rights. She needs to make her voice heard in debates of relevance to human rights protection at the Security Council and in the Secretariat, and to transform her frequent call for a """"rights-based"""" approach to development from a slogan to a demand with programmatic teeth. As people around the globe mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration, it is clear that the world has been dramatically transformed by the ideas set forth in this simple but visionary document. There indeed is much to celebrate. But also much to do to ensure that we live up to its ideals. I would welcome your questions.","Global",""

It reviews developments in 68 countries. I will highlight a few of the trends of the last year. In addition, because this is the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I will look at some of the remarkable developments of the past half century. How does one celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration in a decade marked by genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda? Progress is obvious in much of Latin America, the former Soviet bloc, southern Africa, and in parts of Asia. But how can we open the champagne bottles when terrible abuses persists in so many countries? What can be acclaimed in this anniversary year is the emergence of a powerful movement to deter such abuses -- a movement that makes it far more likely that human rights abuse will be identified, written about in the press, criticized, cited as a justification for cutting off aid or trade, and possibly used as evidence in an international criminal trial.  This movement has produced a dramatic transformation in the way that governments treat their citizens and each other.  First of all, for years, dictatorial governments regularly rejected criticism of their human rights records as """"interference"""" in their """"internal affairs."""" Pressure from other governments to end abuse was rare.  Today, human rights are well established as the legitimate concern of all humanity. Governments regularly comment on each other's rights practices and make respect for rights an important factor in their aid relationships. Even China, one of the last holdouts, has accepted the legitimacy of international scrutiny by signing two major rights treaties and, this year, even protesting human rights abuses against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Second, the Universal Declaration has come to protect a far broader range of people. For many years, it was applied primarily for the benefit of political dissidents and opponents. Today, it is widely understood to benefit not only political activists but also women facing discrimination or violence, refugees, civilians caught in conflict, children, common prisoners, gays and lesbians, religious minorities, workers, as well as those seeking economic, social and cultural rights.  Third, driving these developments has been a veritable explosion in the size and strength of the human rights movement. The Helsinki accords of 1975 affirmed """"the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights,"""" and helped launch the human rights movement in the Soviet bloc. Also in the 1970s, human rights groups emerged in Asia and Latin America to challenge abuses by authoritarian governments. Today, human rights organizations have established a firm presence in all but the most repressive countries.  Fourth, moving to the current year, the most dramatic change has been a substantial strengthening of the international system for bringing the most heinous human rights criminals to justice. Key developments include the arrest of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet, the enthusiastic adoption of a treaty to establish an International Criminal Court, and the substantial progress made by the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Both the Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals seem to have overcome their early problems. Each has numerous defendants in custody and several trials underway, including yesterday's arrest of Bosnian Serb General Krstic, who is accused of playing a major role in the Srebrenica massacre. The main obstacle to the success of the Yugoslav tribunal remains NATO's unwillingness to arrest former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. It is time for NATO to act.  The International Criminal Court, which will provide a forum to prosecute the world's worst human rights offenders, will be weaker than it might have been because of opposition from the United States, China, India and others. But it still will have considerable power to bring to justice those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. Today, the biggest challenge is to hold the line in the face of Washington's continuing efforts to undermine the agreement reached in July in Rome.  The ICC will assume jurisdiction only if national courts are unable or unwilling to try the most serious human rights offenders. So, the United States, with its strong justice system, has little to fear. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has been determined to oppose a court with even a theoretical possibility of prosecuting an American. Its vision of partial justice is, for most of the world, injustice. The arrest and proposed extradition of Pinochet is a tremendously important step which has broken the ice and may finally make powerful governments willing to break the cycle of impunity that so frequently encourages atrocities. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration, through its prolonged silence followed by its misguided plea for deference to Pinochet's self-granted amnesty, is increasingly seen as opposing justice.  Justice will not disrupt transitions to democracy or make it more difficult to encourage abusive officials to relinquish power. Chile's current president felt so confident in the strength of Chilean democracy that at the height of the Pinochet drama he left the country for nine days on a trade mission. Dictators give up power not because they are born-again democrats but because their domestic and international support has waned. Prosecutions, by delegitimizing tyrants, can hasten that process.  International justice will also not, as some fear, endanger democratic leaders with a few human rights peccadillos to their record. The concept of universal jurisdiction that lies behind the Pinochet prosecution applies only to the most severe human rights offenses - genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. With so much renewed interest in justice for the atrocities of the past, it will only be a matter of time before other tyrants face their day in court. That will be an important step toward preventing such crimes in the future. Let me turn to our evaluation of U.S. policy on human rights. The Clinton administration's efforts to promote human rights around the world were subject to large blind spots. Major parts of the globe never made it onto the administration's human rights agenda.  The administration did best with the pariah countries -- Burma, Belarus, Sierra Leone, Sudan. It also performed well on some more pivotal countries, such as Croatia, Malaysia, Algeria, and Indonesia. In some countries, the administration's record was mixed. It waited far too long as Yugoslav forces battered ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo. But then, it brought NATO military pressure to bear until Yugoslav President Milosevic agreed, at least for the time being, to stop the attacks, withdraw some troops, and permit international monitoring. In Bosnia, U.S. troops helped NATO to arrest lesser war crimes suspects but, to our continuing disappointment, not the leaders of the genocide. In Colombia, the administration openly acknowledged the close working relationship between the army and murderous paramilitary forces. But the new U.S. ambassador has been silent on human rights. And the administration implemented half-heartedly and with no transparency the Leahy Amendment which requires it to withhold assistance from forces involved in abuse until they bring those responsible to justice. In Cuba, while ostensibly concerned about human rights, the U.S. government pursued an embargo that itself violated the rights to freedom of expression and movement. Moreover, by adopting an all-or-nothing approach to President Fidel Castro's continuing rule, Washington provided little incentive for him to ease repression of civil society.  In China, the administration helped to enhance dialogue about human rights; to convince the government to sign a key human rights treaty; to secure the release of a handful of prisoners; and to gain permission for President Clinton, during his visit to the country, to speak to the public about human rights. It also pushed, albeit unsuccessfully, for more systematic changes. But the administration had no plan, other than waiting for China to change on its own, for helping to move beyond promises and dialogue to systematic change. Washington gave up two powerful sources of leverage--human rights preconditions to President Clinton's much-sought trip to China, and efforts to secure a resolution critical of China before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights--without developing any alternative way to keep the pressure on. We've seen the results of China's empty promises to respect human rights in its arrest this week of Xu Wenli and his allies for trying to form an independent political party. Vast swaths of the globe were largely exempt from U.S. pressure on human rights. These included most of Central Asia and the Middle East, where oil interests stood in the way of strong human rights advocacy. In Africa, the United States favored strategic alliances with new leaders to paying attention to their human rights problems. The administration remained publicly silent about severe government abuses in Rwanda and the Congo as well as abuses by the Sudan People's Liberation Army. And President Clinton seemed to lower the bar in assessing Uganda's and Nigeria's lack of democracy. This inconsistency in U.S. support for human rights, and the frequent subordination of human rights to so many other interests, threatens to weaken what should be a strong voice for the human rights cause. The Clinton administration also continued to refuse to accept an unconditional ban on anti-personnel landmines. And it continued to obstruct efforts to ban the use of children under 18 years of age as soldiers.  The use of child soldiers -- an estimated 300,000 worldwide -- contributes significantly to the inhumanity of war. The children themselves risk death, physical injury, and deep psychological scars while, because of their lack of maturity, they endanger those who encounter them. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by every country in the world except Somalia, which has no functioning government, and the United States. It sets 18 as the age of maturity on most other matters, and there is a broad international consensus that this bright red line should be used to define the appropriate age of soldiers. But because the Pentagon recruits 17-year-olds out of high school, the U.S. government refuses to join a proposed protocol barring the recruitment of anyone younger than 18. Indeed, by blocking a """"consensus,"""" the Clinton administration refuses to permit anyone else to adopt the protocol for themselves--even though 17-year-olds constitute just 4 percent of active-duty American recruits, and less than ?of 1 percent of active-duty American soldiers. Washington thus has elevated a matter of incremental recruiting convenience over the humanitarian imperative of curbing this cruel and dangerous aspect of warfare. The European Union fared somewhat better than the United States in promoting human rights. Of particular note is its policy of explicitly conditioning its aid and trade relationships on respect for human rights. Unfortunately, it was not always consistent in upholding this conditionality. For example, it applied conditionality productively in the cases of Cuba and Burma, but was too quick to give it up in the case of Serbia and Tunisia.  The E.U. also undermined conditionality by signing a trade agreement with Turkmenistan and moving toward ratifying an agreement with Uzbekistan -- two of Central Asia's most repressive regimes. The E.U. adopted an important code of conduct limiting arms sales to abusive governments, but its members still scrambled to sell arms to Turkey. We also expressed concern that the E.U.'s preference for consensus in its foreign policy might stand in the way of the more active promotion of human rights by some of its members. And we criticized the E.U. for mounting improper barriers to refugees seeking asylum in Europe. At the United Nations, Kofi Annan has shown a greater commitment to human rights than any other U.N. secretary-general. He has been an outspoken defender of human rights, and made serious efforts to integrate human rights into all U.N. activities. UNICEF made the most progress in this regard, while UNDP and UNHCR lagged. Mary Robinson, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, took great strides toward reinvigorating an office that had retreated into the irrelevance of quiet diplomacy under its first occupant. She was at her best on Algeria, Rwanda, and Colombia - outspoken and tough. But much work remains to transform the high commissioner's office into an effective vehicle for defending human rights. She needs to make her voice heard in debates of relevance to human rights protection at the Security Council and in the Secretariat, and to transform her frequent call for a """"rights-based"""" approach to development from a slogan to a demand with programmatic teeth.  As people around the globe mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration, it is clear that the world has been dramatically transformed by the ideas set forth in this simple but visionary document. There indeed is much to celebrate. But also much to do to ensure that we live up to its ideals.  I would welcome your questions.","Global",""

A bill has been introduced before the U.S. Congress that would permit such food aid. """"Food aid is inappropriate for human rights reasons,"""" Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. """"The SPLA has admitted diverting relief food intended for famine victims during the 1998 famine in southern Sudan. Giving them food aid would reward for that abusive behavior."""" A copy of the letter is below. December 10, 1999 Madeleine Albright Secretary of State Department of State Room 6333 Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Dr. Albright,  Human Rights Watch has been monitoring and condemning human rights abuses in Sudan committed by both government and rebel forces for many years. We were concerned to learn that the Administration is contemplating providing food aid to Sudan's armed opposition. We oppose this proposal on human rights grounds and ask that you use your influence to ensure that the Administration refuses to implement the permissive legislation. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is the umbrella group for almost all rebel forces in Sudan. By far the largest army in the NDA is the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). The SPLA controls vast areas of southern Sudan and parts of the Nuba Mountains and the east. The SPLA has a history of gross abuses of human rights and has not made any effort to establish accountability. Its abuses today remain serious. This record makes any form of U.S. support, food or otherwise, wholly inappropriate and wholly out of step with the values that you have tried to inject into U.S. foreign policy. Illustrative of the SPLA's human rights record was its summary execution of three captured Sudan government employees and one Red Crescent tracing officer in March 1999, an act which the U.S. government rightfully condemned. The SPLA refused all requests to turn over the bodies. It falsely claimed that the four were killed in crossfire during an abortive government attempt at rescue. It flatly rejected international protests, including one from the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. It never conducted a review of the incident or accounted for its crime. Instead, its representatives excoriated anyone who mentioned the incident. Similarly in Chukudum, SPLA abuses, including summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and the theft of food, have been so widespread and persistent that they have alienated the formerly loyal local Didinga population. In January 1999 the situation came to a head, with the locals literally up in arms against the occupation of their territory by the Bor Dinka, who make up the majority of the SPLA troops and officers in Chukudum and whose families reside in nearby camps for the internally displaced. There has been intermittent fighting, with civilian casualties, ever since. Some of the civilian casualties have been from antipersonnel land mines which the SPLA has liberally used in the area. Several peace missions have come to Chukudum and made recommendations for the SPLA to rein in its abusive troops, to no avail.  The SPLA has even undercut the prospect of the local justice system addressing such abuses. One example is the case of SPLA Maj. Marial Nuor, who was investigated by the SPLA after he detained elderly foreign nuns and a priest for two weeks in 1996, causing an international uproar. Maj. Nuor, in charge of SPLA recruitment in Yirol, also in 1996 killed two soldiers and three recruits, and tortured an old man to death. He was convicted by an SPLA court martial (but only for mutiny when he evaded arrest), imprisoned briefly, and then placed under """"open arrest.""""At the request of the old man's family, Maj. Nuor was sent back to Yirol in 1999 and tried in a civilian court. He was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail and fines. Several months later, however, the SPLA ordered him to conduct more recruitment in Yirol. After he threatened his fellow officers, bragging of his untouchability, he was transferred from Yirol. To our knowledge he suffered no other punishment.  This pattern makes the provision of any aid to the SPLA wrong, because it would support an abusive force and make the United States complicit in those abuses. Moreover, what makes supplying food aid to the SPLA particularly inappropriate is the group's routine diversion of relief food away from starving civilians. The SPLA diverted relief food even during the 1998 famine in Bahr El Ghazal --- indeed, even from its own civilian supporters. Some of this was done by individual soldiers and officers and local officials for their private profit, but the SPLA did not punish this behavior. At a meeting in May 1999 with U.N. officials and others in Mapel, Bahr El Ghazal, in southern Sudan, SPLA officers admitted that both SPLA and rogue commanders had diverted relief food during the 1998 famine. To provide food aid under these circumstances is to reward this unacceptable and deadly behavior. Some argue that the SPLA would stop diverting relief food if it were to receive food from the international community. Past practice suggests that this is a na?e belief because it discounts the private-profit motive that lies behind much of this diversion and the SPLA's unwillingness to rein in such ventures. Moreover, providing food aid to a rebel force as a way of stopping its unremedied diversion of food aid to starving civilians would set a terrible precedent. It would encourage rebel groups throughout Africa and around the world to duplicate the SPLA's inhumane practices, knowing that the reward might be free U.S.-supplied food. We understand that a large impetus for wanting to aid the SPLA is the Sudanese government's own abysmal human rights record. Human Rights Watch has documented that record extensively. For example, our March 1999 book-length report on Sudan highlighted such abuses as the government's banning of relief flights to famine-stricken areas for two months, which was a significant cause of the devastating 1998 famine in Bahr El Ghazal. The government is now banning relief flights in Western Upper Nile, another area made vulnerable by government military efforts to dislodge southern civilians from oil-rich areas where they happen to live. But these abuses could justify aid to the government's adversaries only if they themselves were respectful of human rights. As we have noted, the SPLA is anything but a human rights-respecting force.  Finally, we note with regret that similarly misguided policy has recently prevented the United States from playing the lead role in international fora in condemning Sudan's horrible human rights record. The misguided U.S. bombing of al Shifa factory in Khartoum in August 1998 severely hampered the U.S. government's ability to lead its allies on Sudan issues. That is because the Sudanese government seized the opportunity to portray itself as a victim, conveniently forgetting how many times its own planes have bombed southern relief locations, hospitals, and civilian villages. The result of this relative U.S. absence on the diplomatic front were weak, consensual resolutions on human rights in Sudan, negotiated by the European Union with the Sudanese government, in the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and at the U.N. General Assembly. That the Sudanese representative thanked the U.N. Commission for this resolution gives a good sense of how inadequate it was in portraying the state of human rights in Sudan. A decision by the U.S. government to take the side of the SPLA by materially aiding the forced is likely to backfire in similar ways, producing a result that no one in the U.S. Congress or the Administration wants. Regardless of how the decision is explained, it will be seen as compromising the United States as a voice on human rights in Sudan by formally aligning it with the abusive practices of the SPLA. This will further impede efforts to condemn the Sudan government's human rights record in international fora.  For all of these reasons, we urge you to use your considerable influence to ensure that the United States refrains from materially assisting the rebel forces in Sudan.

Local villagers, including relatives of the victim who were interviewed by Ilayev, were later ordered to gather and bury his burned remains. Ilayev told Human Rights Watch that Hamid Hasuyev, about sixty, Isa Muradov, about forty-five, and Musa Gelkhayev, about twenty-five, were also killed in their homes by looting soldiers. Ilayev said that Alimpasha Assuyev, about twenty-five years old, and an unidentified refugee were killed after they had protested being beaten by soldiers in a cellar.

Ilayev had made five unsuccessful attempts to gain permission to reenter the village after Russian forces established control. He succeeded, together with two other villagers, on December 9--after bribing local soldiers with a bottle of vodka. Looting appears widespread in the town, and many homes in the town have been burned down by looting soldiers.

Ilayev told Human Rights Watch that the soldiers allow people to leave their homes only between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. everyday, and are forcing people to remain in their homes or backyards for the remainder of the time.

The rearrests were ordered by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on December 3, 1999.   The organization also expressed strong concern about the safety and whereabouts of some of the fifty-four people arrested. Some of the court officials, who approved the prison releases, have received threats since the rearrests began. """"Justice cannot be carried out through executive order,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This crackdown is undermining the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, both of which are still quite fragile in Cambodia."""" The arrests were ordered by Prime Minister Hun Sen in a letter dated December 3, ostensibly in an effort to curb rampant corruption by court officials, who have allegedly taken bribes and improperly released suspected criminals. Hun Sen's letter orders the rearrest throughout Cambodia of all suspected armed robbers, kidnappers, and drug traffickers who have been released by the courts because charges were dropped, on bail, or on parole. Some of those arrested had been found not guilty at trial.  As of December 10, at least fifty-four people reportedly had been rearrested in Phnom Penh. The whereabouts of sixteen of them are unknown, while others have been transferred to Phnom Penh prisons. Prison officials throughout the country have been ordered to compile lists of released prisoners, although as of Friday, no rearrests had been made in the provinces.  The rearrests were not based on any new evidence nor were warrants issued at the time of the arrests, in violation of Cambodian law. To try people twice for the same crime also constitutes a violation of article 14(7) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Cambodia is a party. Detention orders for those sent to prison as of Thursday do not list any formal charges for rearrest and detention but state only that the detentions have been carried out under Order of the Royal Government No. 167, a reference to Hun Sen's December 3 letter.  The international organization also protested the December 7 suspension of the president and chief prosecutor of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court by the Minister of Justice, because of allegations of corruption. The suspensions are in violation of Cambodian law, which states that the Supreme Council of Magistracy (SCM) is the sole body with the right to suspend or take disciplinary action against judges and prosecutors. """"Clearly there is a need for judicial reform in Cambodia,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"These arrests do nothing to address corruption in the courts or strengthen the independence of the judiciary. Instead, the crackdown only demonstrates how vulnerable Cambodia's judiciary is to political pressure and executive fiat."""" Judicial reform should be carried out through established legal mechanisms such as the Supreme Council of Magistracy, which is mandated to discipline judges but has not been functioning effectively.  Human Rights Watch urged that reform of the criminal justice system involve not only the courts, but the police as well, who are also believed to take bribes. """"The crackdown weakens the role of the judiciary while strengthening the police,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Hun Sen is making them the ones to decide guilt or innocence.""""  In order to promote a genuinely independent judiciary, Human Rights Watch has advocated that the Royal Cambodian Government launch a program of judicial reforms that includes empowering and activating the Supreme Council of Magistracy to address issues of corruption and political pressure on the judiciary; providing guarantees and practical measures to ensure the safety of judges; passing the overdue Law on the Statute of Magistrates to address issues such as conflict of interest; and enforcing legal prohibitions against out-of-court financial compensation for felonies and major criminal offenses.

Rosemary Nelson was the second human rights lawyer to have been killed in Northern Ireland; the first was Patrick Finucane in 1989. Loyalist paramilitaries claimed responsibility for both murders.   The failure to carry out an independent inquiry into Patrick Finucane's killing, and to find those responsible for his death, contributed to a deterioration in the rule of law, whereby some police officers regularly made derogatory and intimidatory remarks against defence lawyers without fear of sanction. The death of Rosemary Nelson further undermined the rule of law and underlined the government's failure to meet its obligation, under international standards, to ensure that lawyers could do their jobs without fear for their personal safety and without hindrance.   The murder of Rosemary Nelson was also a serious indictment of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) failure to carry out a fundamental aspect of its job, which is """"to protect and save lives"""". It was an indictment of the government's and RUC's failure to seriously consider allegations of intimidation of lawyers and to clamp down on unlawful and unprofessional conduct by police officers. It was an indictment of the RUC's failure to make a correct security assessment of a risk to life and to take the necessary action.   We recognize that the current criminal investigation is limited to the specific circumstances of the murder and will not be able to deal with the many questions that the circumstances of Rosemary Nelson's murder raise. Therefore, we urge the UK authorities to meet their obligations under international standards to carry out an independent, thorough and impartial inquiry into these circumstances. The remit of the inquiry should include an investigation of:   a) Rosemary Nelson's complaints against RUC harassment and intimidation, which should be in the context of also investigating alleged RUC harassment and intimidation of other lawyers through their clients in special interrogation centres;b) death threats received by Rosemary Nelson in the context of death threats made to others by Loyalist paramilitaries at the same time; c) the RUC's failure to initiate an impartial investigation into her allegations of consistent threats; d) the RUC's failure to investigate other lawyers' allegations of threats and intimidation; e) the RUC's failure to take Rosemary Nelson's fears seriously, to take human rights organizations' complaints seriously, and ultimately to protect her life; f) the Northern Ireland Office's failure to ensure protection of Rosemary Nelson's life; g) the Northern Ireland Office's failure to implement with most of the recommendations made by the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers in 1998 concerning the intimidation of lawyers.   Background on Complaints made by Rosemary Nelson   Patrick Finucane was shot dead in February 1989. Following Patrick Finucane's death, lawyers took threats against their lives and physical integrity much more seriously. Rosemary Nelson received deaths threats at her office and her home. She was also subjected to threats and intimidation by Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers from 1996 onwards and lodged official complaints. Rosemary Nelson was killed in a car bomb on 15 March 1999. Loyalist paramilitaries claimed responsibility for her murder. She was killed after many appeals had been made to the authorities to protect her life. Having failed to protect her, the authorities must now carry out a full inquiry not only into the murder and any possible collusion in it, but also into how the authorities ultimately failed to protect her life.   Human rights organizations, national and international, believed that Rosemary Nelson had been threatened because of her work on a number of high profile cases. We all urged the government and the police to ensure Rosemary Nelson's security, as did the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, who even issued an urgent action on her behalf in 1997. The Garvaghy Road Residents Association raised concerns about her security. All to no avail.   Investigation into Rosemary Nelson's complaints   Some of Rosemary Nelson's complaints against the RUC, based on comments made to her clients in special interrogation centres, were initially investigated by the RUC under the supervision of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC). The ICPC supervisor became very concerned at the conduct of the RUC investigation, citing the hostility, evasiveness and disinterest of police officers; eventually the Chief Constable asked the Metropolitan Commander Niall Mulvihill to take over.   After the death of Rosemary Nelson, Mulvihill issued his review of the initial RUC investigation, which appeared to vindicate the RUC's handling of it. This published review did not deal with Rosemary Nelson's complaints about police abuse. It was coupled with RUC attempts to personalize the ICPC's supervisor's conclusions as """"subjective"""". This review was not carried out thoroughly and impartially and was severely criticized by the ICPC Chairperson Paul Donnelly in a private report.   Commander Mulvihill's review of Rosemary Nelson's complaints remains with the DPP (where it has been since March). But given the nature of the investigation, and the ICPC Chairperson's criticisms, we do not have any confidence in the findings of this investigation.   Other complaints made by Rosemary Nelson, including one of assault by RUC officers in July 1997, are still being dealt with by the ICPC.   Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port's investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder has also failed to investigate Rosemary Nelson's complaints about police abuse thoroughly. Such an investigation, in order to have compelling credibility, should be part of a wider inquiry into complaints by other lawyers of intimidation and harassment, as recommended by the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. Only by painstakingly investigating many complaints, comparing dates and the identities of detectives allegedly making comments, would one be able to determine a pattern of certain detectives targeting particular lawyers.   Investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder   Immediately after Rosemary Nelson's death, human rights organizations urged the government to launch an immediate independent and thorough investigation into her killing. The RUC Chief Constable attempted to give credibility to an RUC investigation by declaring that he had appointed an English Chief Constable to head the investigation and had also called in the FBI. NGOs expressed concern that these appointments failed to satisfy the requirements of an independent investigation and continued to urge that the RUC should not be centrally involved in the investigation. Within weeks the Chief Constable further appointed Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port to lead the investigation on a day-to-day basis. However, NGOs continued to be concerned because Colin Port's investigation involved RUC officers centrally in both the murder investigation and, for several months, in the collusion investigation; in addition, his investigation was based in Lurgan RUC station, which undermined the credibility of the investigation.   While Colin Port is actively investigating aspects of the case, to date his investigation has not resulted in any arrests. We note this with great concern.","Europe/Central Asia, United Kingdom",""

Only by painstakingly investigating many complaints, comparing dates and the identities of detectives allegedly making comments, would one be able to determine a pattern of certain detectives targeting particular lawyers. Investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder Immediately after Rosemary Nelson's death, human rights organizations urged the government to launch an immediate independent and thorough investigation into her killing. The RUC Chief Constable attempted to give credibility to an RUC investigation by declaring that he had appointed an English Chief Constable to head the investigation and had also called in the FBI. NGOs expressed concern that these appointments failed to satisfy the requirements of an independent investigation and continued to urge that the RUC should not be centrally involved in the investigation. Within weeks the Chief Constable further appointed Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port to lead the investigation on a day-to-day basis. However, NGOs continued to be concerned because Colin Port's investigation involved RUC officers centrally in both the murder investigation and, for several months, in the collusion investigation; in addition, his investigation was based in Lurgan RUC station, which undermined the credibility of the investigation. While Colin Port is actively investigating aspects of the case, to date his investigation has not resulted in any arrests. We note this with great concern.","Europe/Central Asia, United Kingdom",""

""""We will remember 1999 as the year in which sovereignty gave way in places where crimes against humanity were being committed,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. He noted that sustained international pressure forced the Indonesian government to consent to the deployment of foreign troops in East Timor, after the Indonesian military failed to stop bloodshed there. The national sovereignty claims of the Indonesian generals, like those of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo this year, lost their legitimacy in the wake of gross human rights crimes.     """"Ordinarily we depend on sovereign states to defend human rights,"""" said Roth. """"But sovereignty cannot be used as an excuse to avoid human rights commitments."""" While regretting the need for military force, Roth praised the decision to overrule the claims of tyrants and war criminals to be protected by the cloak of national sovereignty.     Human Rights Watch cautioned, however, that the use of military force to redress crimes against humanity, such as the NATO campaign in Kosovo this year, is also a sign of failure to respond to the early warning signs of gross human rights abuse. The group warned that serious abuses in countries such as Colombia, Burundi, and the Aceh region of Indonesia could lead to major crises if they are not promptly addressed through strong political and economic pressure.     Roth also noted that governments using military force in the name of human rights should be subjected to close scrutiny, both for the methods they use in warfare, and the objectives they pursue. """"Human rights should not be used as a pretext for other ventures,"""" said Roth.     Roth presented Human Rights Watch's """"World Report 2000"""" at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. today. The 517-page report covers human rights developments in 68 countries, including the United States.     In another illustration of the breakdown of national sovereignty when crimes against humanity occur, Roth observed that many people accused of serious human rights crimes are being tried outside their native countries, a triumph of the principle of """"universal jurisdiction."""" Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who faces extradition hearings in Great Britain, is the best-known example, but many other people accused of participating in the Bosnian and Rwandan genocides have also been indicted outside their home countries.     """"Pinochet is being prosecuted abroad because local courts in Chile have failed to do so,"""" said Roth. """"This is a real victory for justice.""""     International war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have a growing number of people in custody. The latter court took the significant step of indicting a sitting head of state, Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, for war crimes this year.     Despite the U.S. government's opposition, a growing number of countries are signing the treaty for an international criminal court, which will be a critically important tool for human rights protection. """"No matter what Washington thinks, there's no question now that the court will be established,"""" said Roth. """"The only question is when.""""     Human Rights Watch supported Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations in his statements that national leaders risk prosecution if they do not either stop crimes against humanity or permit other countries to do so. However, the group criticized U.N. operations in many countries, such as Angola and Sierra Leone, for failing to respond vigorously enough when human rights crimes pushed those countries toward war.     Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring organization based in New York. It is funded entirely by contributions from private individuals and foundations, and receives no financial support from any government.","Africa, Americas, Asia, United States, Chile, Colombia, Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Global","International Justice"

Mengistu, who has lived in Zimbabwe since 1991, arrived in South Africa in November for medical treatment.

The group said that government troops and ECOMOG, the West African peacekeeping forces, have so far been unwilling to intervene to protect civilians.   The rebel attacks, which had previously been centered around the western town of Port Loko, spread during November to two areas in Sierra Leone's Northern Province: Kambia (110 kilometers north of Freetown) and Kabala (200 km northeast of Freetown). The persistent rebel attacks in all three areas include rape, murder, abduction, torture and brutalization of the civilian population. The frequent ambushes along some northern highways have made them impassable for civilian traffic.   """"The government seems to be bending over backwards to accommodate rebel leaders,"""" said Peter Takirambudde. """"It has simply ignored the rebel atrocities being committed against civilians. These are criminal acts, not political ones, and the government should at least be making an effort to stop them.""""   During the month of November, Human Rights Watch documented rebel attacks on some twenty villages and took testimony from scores of civilian victims. The majority of these attacks occurred during food raids in which rebel soldiers entered villages looking for foodstuffs, livestock and money. Several civilians were killed and many more were tortured and stabbed as rebel soldiers terrorized the civilians into telling them where their valuables and food were hidden. During most attacks civilians, usually women, were abducted and forced to carry looted goods and harvest rice. They were very often raped.   The attacks have forced thousands of civilians to flee their homes and led to the displacement of over 12,000, some 5000 of whom since late November crossed over into neighboring Guinea.   The ceasefire agreement signed on May 18 called on all parties to """"maintain their present and respective positions... and refrain from any hostile or aggressive act which could undermine the peace process."""" Despite this, rebel groups have been moving in and out of government-held areas to commit atrocities against the civilian population.   There has been little response from Sierra Leone Army troops and ECOMOG to stop these atrocities and provide protection to the civilian population. Several of the ambushes and attacks documented by Human Rights Watch have been committed just miles away from government and ECOMOG checkpoints. In late November, members of the government's Civil Defense Forces captured some ten Revolutionary United Front (RUF) combatants who were harassing civilians in Nenekoro village, near Kabala. After receiving a complaint from RUF leader Foday Sankoh, the government ordered the prisoners released instead of initiating criminal proceedings against them.   Frequent ambushes of cars and mini-buses, including a November 17 attack on an aid agency's vehicle carrying malnourished children and their mothers near Port Loko, has effectively halted civilian traffic around this area. A young woman died and three others were wounded on November 27 when rebels opened fire on a mini-bus during an ambush just outside of Port Loko.   A peace accord signed in Lome, Togo called for rebels to lay down their arms in exchange for representation in the government, and included a controversial general amnesty for all crimes committed during the civil war. The implementation of the agreement has been marred by delays in all of the key areas, most importantly disarmament and the release by rebel forces of thousands of civilian abductees.   Testimonies from Civilian Victims of Recent Abuses   A 33-year-old woman from Petifu village, between Port Loko and Lunghi, was one of two women gang-raped by rebels during an attack on Petifu village on November 16. The woman, who was 6 months pregnant at the time, described losing her baby after being raped by at least 15 rebels. She said:  """"After harvesting our rice we were relaxing at sundown on the verandah when a group of about 30 rebels surprised us. They surrounded us and some of my friends got away. They screamed for food and money and then put a rope around me like a goat and pulled me into the bushes demanding that I tell them where the rice stores were. I told them we didn't have any and then 8 of them beat me and raped me right there in the bush. I begged them and said I was pregnant and they said that was obvious to them. Then they pulled me back to the village where the rest of them raped me all night long. I lost count after 15. The next morning they wanted me to carry rice and palm oil but I couldn't even walk. After they'd gone I started bleeding. I tried to get up but collapsed right in the middle of the village. And later that night I delivered my baby all alone. The labor was 3 hours and my baby lived for less than an hour.""""  An 18-year-old man from Kaseidugu, some 15 miles from Kabala, described being stabbed in the back during a night attack by some 20 rebels on November 17. His wife and 7-month-old son were abducted in the same raid, and a 50-year-old farmer was also killed.  """"We were sleeping, but they stormed into the farmhouse and woke all of us up, demanding palm wine and food. I offered them something to eat but they demanded goats, chickens, and money. I told them I didn't have any. Four of them surrounded me and started cutting my arms with knives; They all took turns until one of them grabbed the knife and said, 'You're not doing it right.' Then he stabbed me deep into my back. My wife was screaming, 'They're carrying me away' as they dragged her and my baby son away. I've not seen them since.""""  A 15-year-old girl from Madina Bokobah village, near Fadugu, was abducted on November 2 with her four sisters, and forced by rebels to carry looted goods. She was held for two weeks and repeatedly raped before escaping to Kabala. She described her capture:  """"On our way to the farm, we ran into more than 20 of them [the rebels]. They beat us and gave us palm oil, rice and peanuts they'd just looted from our village to carry. Four of my sisters had their children, all under a year old, on their backs. One of the rebels told them to put the kids on the ground so they could carry more. When my sisters refused the men pulled the babies off their backs and threw them into the bush. My sister Fati ran to pick up her child and they beat her seriously. She went back again and they took a knife and slashed her hand but she wouldn't give up so they finally let her take her 5-month-old. But the others left their kids in the bush. We carried our load for two days and when we reached the rebel base they let the others go. But since I was youngest and didn't have any children, they kept me for two weeks until I could escape. I cried to the big man commander but he said I was theirs now.""""  A 35-year-old trader described being raped and robbed of hundreds of dollars during an ambush on a public bus on November 19. At least one other woman was raped and several more were abducted during the attack, which took place some 70 miles north of Freetown but less than five miles from an ECOMOG checkpoint.  """"The bus was packed full. We were on our way to Guinea to buy goods to sell in Freetown. I'd saved for months for this trip. We slowed for a pot hole south of Rogberi Junction, and scores of them jumped out of the bushes. Three had rocket-propelled grenade launchers [and their] faces were painted black, and so many with AK's, machetes and machine guns. They swarmed into the bus and started roughing us up: pulling, beating us, threatening to kill us if we didn't give them the money. There was confusion so I jumped and ran out the door, but two of them chased after me. 'I beg,' I said to them, but they told me, 'Tie down because we're going to slaughter you.' They beat me as they searched me for the money which I had well hidden. They stole all I had and then two of them raped me and cut my legs with a knife. They said they were going to abduct me but I begged them, especially because it is so near to the holy month of Ramadan.""""","Africa, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, International Justice, Torture, Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than a dozen civilians who have fled the city in the past few days and crossed the border into Ingushetia. They report that a significant percentage of the population remains behind, particularly the elderly, poor, infirm, and wounded. They have been pinned down in their homes and basements under aircraft and artillery fire for several weeks.   """"The civilian tragedy in Grozy is very significant, and getting worse,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The Russian forces need to announce a break in the bombing to let those people out.""""   The city has been without electricity, gas, running water, and heating supply since at least the beginning of November. Witnesses relate rapidly dwindling food supplies, and prices that have escalated threefold for the remaining food. Bazaars and stores have ceased to operate altogether. Desperate residents are forced to travel up to three miles under heavy aerial and artillery fire to fetch fresh water.   According to many medical personnel from Grozny who have taken refuge in neighboring Ingushetia, the city's hospitals and medical clinics are completely shut down, leaving civilians without access even to basic medical care. The doctors told Human Rights Watch that when they left the city in early to mid-November there were countless numbers of wounded and sick, including some who were dying and unable to flee.   Magomet Usmanov, a resident of the Chernorechye suburb of Grozny, told Human Rights Watch that in late November, residents regularly fetched water at the only site that remained in the city, the Groznenskoe water storage tank. On November 29, however, two bombs fell on that site. After hearing the explosions, Usmanov went out of his house and met people who had been gathering water when the bombs began to fall. """"Now people are afraid to go and get water,"""" said Usmanov, """"because they have to cross the road and walk in the open.""""   On November 25 or 26 at 2:00 p.m., Usmanov continued, three bombs hit a small bazaar located near the dam. According to Usmanov, civilians were selling products that they had at great risk traveled to buy in Goyty. The wounded were transported to Goyty, about fifteen kilometers south of Grozny. The very next day, as Usmanov was on the street leading from the center of Chernorechye towards a dam, a warplane dropped a bomb on the same site. """"Two woman died right before my eyes,"""" he said. """"Their bodies flew up into the air, then fell back on to the pavement. I was about 200 meters away from the explosion, and it left a crater about six meters wide by six meters deep. People are too terrified even to poke their nose outside."""" Usmanov and his family fled Chernorechye during the night of November 30 in order to avoid fire and shelling, traveling on foot through wooded areas to Goyty. Usmanov's wife, Raisa Usmanova, reported that three families had remained behind in their apartment building, and that in the apartment blocks adjacent to the Usmanov home many civilians remained, lacking the funds to leave. Usmanov himself claimed that many people remained in the suburb of Aldy, about five kilometers from the center of Grozny. The Usmanovs also related that bread was nowhere to be found when they left Chernorechye at the end of November.   Lyoma Mashtaev, 39 years old, a former driver from Grozny, left the city on December 1, explaining that Grozny was besieged by air and rocket fire. He told Human Rights Watch that on November 27 at 10:00 a.m., eight warplanes scored direct hits on Sector 30 of the Oktyabrskii district. Mashtaev's nephew, Khasmagomet Magomadov, was among the casualties, as were Daud Khushparov, Rukhman Kaisarov, and an elderly Russian woman and her son who lived on Dal'nyaya Street."""" I visited six or seven houses to express my condolences,"""" said Mashtaev. Mashtaev believed that seventeen people were killed in the attack, but another Grozny resident, """"Saidmagomed"""" (not his real name), 40 years old, claimed that only eight persons had been killed.   """"Only old food supplies remain,"""" said Mashtaev. """"For water, you have to go to Chernorechye, a distance of about four kilometers. There aren't any other fresh water sources."""" Mashtaev traveled the road from Grozny to Goyty in order to flee, asserting that at the time it was the only exit route from the capital.

Following weeks of intensive bombing of the Chechen capital, which has resulted in an unknown number of civilian casualties, Russian forces have in recent days effected a full blockade of the city. Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than a dozen civilians who have fled the city in the past few days and crossed the border into Ingushetia. They report that a significant percentage of the population remains behind, particularly the elderly, poor, infirm, and wounded. They have been pinned down in their homes and basements under aircraft and artillery fire for several weeks. """"The civilian tragedy in Grozy is very significant, and getting worse,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The Russian forces need to announce a break in the bombing to let those people out."""" The city has been without electricity, gas, running water, and heating supply since at least the beginning of November. Witnesses relate rapidly dwindling food supplies, and prices that have escalated threefold for the remaining food. Bazaars and stores have ceased to operate altogether. Desperate residents are forced to travel up to three miles under heavy aerial and artillery fire to fetch fresh water. According to many medical personnel from Grozny who have taken refuge in neighboring Ingushetia, the city's hospitals and medical clinics are completely shut down, leaving civilians without access even to basic medical care. The doctors told Human Rights Watch that when they left the city in early to mid-November there were countless numbers of wounded and sick, including some who were dying and unable to flee. Magomet Usmanov, a resident of the Chernorechye suburb of Grozny, told Human Rights Watch that in late November, residents regularly fetched water at the only site that remained in the city, the Groznenskoe water storage tank. On November 29, however, two bombs fell on that site. After hearing the explosions, Usmanov went out of his house and met people who had been gathering water when the bombs began to fall. """"Now people are afraid to go and get water,"""" said Usmanov, """"because they have to cross the road and walk in the open."""" On November 25 or 26 at 2:00 p.m., Usmanov continued, three bombs hit a small bazaar located near the dam. According to Usmanov, civilians were selling products that they had at great risk traveled to buy in Goyty. The wounded were transported to Goyty, about fifteen kilometers south of Grozny. The very next day, as Usmanov was on the street leading from the center of Chernorechye towards a dam, a warplane dropped a bomb on the same site. """"Two woman died right before my eyes,"""" he said. """"Their bodies flew up into the air, then fell back on to the pavement. I was about 200 meters away from the explosion, and it left a crater about six meters wide by six meters deep. People are too terrified even to poke their nose outside."""" Usmanov and his family fled Chernorechye during the night of November 30 in order to avoid fire and shelling, traveling on foot through wooded areas to Goyty. Usmanov's wife, Raisa Usmanova, reported that three families had remained behind in their apartment building, and that in the apartment blocks adjacent to the Usmanov home many civilians remained, lacking the funds to leave. Usmanov himself claimed that many people remained in the suburb of Aldy, about five kilometers from the center of Grozny. The Usmanovs also related that bread was nowhere to be found when they left Chernorechye at the end of November. Lyoma Mashtaev, 39 years old, a former driver from Grozny, left the city on December 1, explaining that Grozny was besieged by air and rocket fire. He told Human Rights Watch that on November 27 at 10:00 a.m., eight warplanes scored direct hits on Sector 30 of the Oktyabrskii district. Mashtaev's nephew, Khasmagomet Magomadov, was among the casualties, as were Daud Khushparov, Rukhman Kaisarov, and an elderly Russian woman and her son who lived on Dal'nyaya Street."""" I visited six or seven houses to express my condolences,"""" said Mashtaev. Mashtaev believed that seventeen people were killed in the attack, but another Grozny resident, """"Saidmagomed"""" (not his real name), 40 years old, claimed that only eight persons had been killed. """"Only old food supplies remain,"""" said Mashtaev. """"For water, you have to go to Chernorechye, a distance of about four kilometers. There aren't any other fresh water sources."""" Mashtaev traveled the road from Grozny to Goyty in order to flee, asserting that at the time it was the only exit route from the capital. Now, however, he claimed, the Russian forces had taken up positions between Goyty and Urus-Martan, both located south of Grozny, blocking even this exit route.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/12/03/uzbekistan-citizens-vote-parliamentary-elections","Uzbekistan- Citizens to Vote in Parliamentary Elections","Uzbekistan: Citizens to Vote in Parliamentary Elections","","12/03/1999","On December 5, Uzbekistan's voters will go to the polls for the second time since independence in 1991 to elect 250 deputies to the Olii Majlis, or parliament. Despite government claims that elections will be free and pluralistic, the parliamentary and local council elections will be a highly-controlled exercise in Potemkin democracy. With no opposition parties, no free media and a tight rein on independent candidates, voters do not have the ability to freely choose their representatives. International organizations have determined that pre-election conditions do not meet basic requirements for a free and fair poll. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, part of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has recognized that """"fundamental freedoms necessary for the emergence of a genuine opposition, as well as for a free and unhindered campaign"""" are lacking. The OSCE therefore announced on November 22 that it would send only a Limited Assessment Mission of 19 persons to Uzbekistan, instead of a full mission to observe the vote.     The domestic Uzbek media have distorted this issue, however, repeatedly asserting that these representatives are """"international election observers"""" who have come to confirm the democratic nature of the vote.     Political Parties   Uzbek officials have stressed that five registered political parties have nominated candidates for seats in parliament. None of the five, however, have voiced any disagreement with government policies, and President Karimov himself in June admitted that he couldn't tell the difference between them.     There are no legal opposition parties in Uzbekistan. The government has refused to register the two opposition parties formed in Uzbekistan in the early 1990s, Birlik (Unity) and Erk (Freedom). In August, a court convicted several prominent members of the Erk party of anti-state crimes, ignoring the defendants' accusations that their confessions were coerced under torture. The President has repeatedly accused Erk's leader, Mohammad Solikh, in exile since 1994, of masterminding the February 1999 Tashkent bombings as an attempt on his life. Other current and former members of these parties are subject to frequent harassment and surveillance.     Independent Candidates   Central Electoral Commission (CEC) Chairman Najmiddin Komilov has touted the registration of 132 independent candidates as evidence of a pluralistic process. Evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch suggests that the registration and campaign efforts of these non-party unaffiliated candidates was in fact highly constrained.     Several would-be candidates in Bukhara province reported being told by the provincial electoral commission that they could not stand for election in their home districts, even though the deadline for registration had not yet passed. Instead the commission proposed that they run in neighboring districts where they would have less of a chance both to gather the signatures necessary for registration and to win support from unfamiliar voters.     State Interference in the Campaign   Once registered, candidates face considerable obstacles in their campaigns. The Central Electoral Commission under Chairman Komilov seems determined to control even normal campaign activity-which he has denounced as """"undermining the democratic basis of elections""""-including campaigning at workplaces or in residential areas, meeting with heads of neighborhood organizations, and the like. Komilov further prohibited candidates from printing more than 5,000 copies of campaign materials and banned any campaign-related broadcasts on cable television.     Independent candidate Shukhrarh Bafaev complained bitterly to Human Rights Watch of the intense controls placed on candidates by the CEC: """"The whole campaign is carried out under the guidance of the election commissions. When I want to go meet potential voters, I first have to let them [the CEC] know. Then they can go and tell the people that I am coming."""" Bafaev alleged that CEC representatives went so far as to instruct the voter groups as to what questions they could pose in upcoming discussions with the candidate and what issues they would not be allowed to raise.     A Human Rights Watch representative witnessed an example of this on-the-spot censorship during a campaign meeting in Bukhara, where the local election commission representative interrupted audience members' comments and advised citizens that certain areas of questioning were off-limits.     Government-favored candidates enjoy access to state resources to advance their campaigns. Human Rights Watch representatives noted employees of the Tashkent municipal government canvassing apartment buildings four days before the vote to deliver leaflets in support of the executive of one of Tashkent's municipal districts.     Media   The government tightly controls the print media in Uzbekistan and subjects it to Soviet-style prepublication censorship. Criticism of government policies is strictly forbidden.     According to Internews, an international NGO that supports the growth of independent media, state agencies refused to re-register two of the twenty-four privately-owned Uzbek television stations in November, although they had submitted their applications on time. Another privately-owned station was deprived of two-thirds of its broadcast hours, which were then re-allocated to the competing state-owned station. In contrast, two private stations owned or directed by persons occupying government posts were recently re-registered without any problem. Human Rights Watch is concerned that these closures, coming in the month before parliamentary elections are due to take place, narrow the already minuscule space available for sources of information other than official government media, and move Uzbekistan even further away from the freedom of information necessary for the democratic process.     Election Monitors   Uzbekistan's electoral law allows for citizens to be registered as vote monitors. Several NGOs across the country have successfully registered their members as monitors, but the government has obstructed many individuals who attempted to register as monitors.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","Free Speech"

Administrators of the Sleptsovsk-North camp, which is run by displaced persons, told Human Rights Watch today that two children who had caught cold in November died from a lack of basic medicine and treatment. One child was eight months old, the other two years old.   The Russian authorities have maintained that there is """"no humanitarian disaster"""" in the northern Caucasus. But the latest research by a team of Human Rights Watch investigators in Ingushetia confirms that the humanitarian disaster in the northern Caucasus is in fact extensive, and getting worse.   """"The federal authorities in Moscow are still trying to sanitize what is happening,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"It's unconscionable to engage in this kind of propaganda when so much suffering is obviously going on.""""   More than 7,000 displaced persons are crowded into 124 railway wagons in the Sleptsovsk-North camp. Each railway car has space for 54 people, although some cars are housing up to 70. Many of the wagons until recently lacked heat altogether. Others have a weak, water-based heating system which is working at under half capacity; persistent leaks and a sporadic water supply threaten to bring the system to a full halt. Last week, wood stoves were delivered to those wagons with no heating system at all, but the Federal Migration Service, which is the Russian government body responsible for displaced people, has failed to supply wood or coal on a regular basis.   Due to intensified hostilities in Chechnya, the displaced continue to flow into the camp at a rate of 30-40 per day, but overcrowding forces many to sleep outside in the cold. A woman named Haida, who has since been relocated to Wagon No. 54, recounted how she and her children were forced to sleep outside for eleven days in mid-November. Many children and the elderly are stricken with colds and dysentery. In Wagon No. 67, Zura, a Grozny resident, said that all of the children were sick and suffer from constant coughing.   The displaced in the Sleptsovsk-North camp also lack warm clothing and bedding, soap, cooking supplies and facilities, medicine, baby food, blankets, shoes (particularly for children), as well as psychological support.   About 175,000 displaced people are being hosted in the homes of local people in Ingushetia, where the total population is only 347,000. According to a representative of one of the few international aid organizations working in the region, displaced people staying in private homes also lack basic supplies.   On November 10, Human Rights Watch and Memorial, a leading Russian human rights organization, sent a joint later to the Minister of Emergency Situations, Sergei Shoigu, urging redress for the desperate conditions in Sleptsovsk-North. Human Rights Watch researchers visited the facility on November 15, documenting all of the conditions described above. Since that time, Federal Migration Service officials have repeatedly stated that aid is on the way. On a visit yesterday (December 1), Human Rights Watch researchers found no change in basic conditions in Sleptsovsk-North in the last two weeks.   Meanwhile, people fleeing Chechnya continue to be subjected to bombardment along their escape routes and solicited for bribes by Russian forces at checkpoints and border crossings. Human Rights Watch collects almost daily testimony on these abuses, as well as on sporadic closures of the Ingush-Chechen border, which sometimes leave those traveling in either direction stranded in the cold and snow for two or three days.   Human Rights Watch called on the Russian authorities to ensure protection and assistance for the internally displaced in Ingushetia. It urged the government to ensure full and unimpeded access for international agencies, as well as necessary security, in order provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and other parts of Russia.

""""If public figures and elected officials are not free to criticize government policies without risking arrest, what ordinary citizen will dare to speak out?""""

The council has been under pressure to lift their immunity, and voted thirty-three to eight today to condemn the petition and set up a committee to monitor council members' behavior.

Due to intensified hostilities in Chechnya, the displaced continue to flow into the camp at a rate of 30-40 per day, but overcrowding forces many to sleep outside in the cold. A woman named Haida, who has since been relocated to Wagon No. 54, recounted how she and her children were forced to sleep outside for eleven days in mid-November. Many children and the elderly are stricken with colds and dysentery. In Wagon No. 67, Zura, a Grozny resident, said that all of the children were sick and suffer from constant coughing. The displaced in the Sleptsovsk-North camp also lack warm clothing and bedding, soap, cooking supplies and facilities, medicine, baby food, blankets, shoes (particularly for children), as well as psychological support.  About 175,000 displaced people are being hosted in the homes of local people in Ingushetia, where the total population is only 347,000. According to a representative of one of the few international aid organizations working in the region, displaced people staying in private homes also lack basic supplies. On November 10, Human Rights Watch and Memorial, a leading Russian human rights organization, sent a joint later to the Minister of Emergency Situations, Sergei Shoigu, urging redress for the desperate conditions in Sleptsovsk-North. Human Rights Watch researchers visited the facility on November 15, documenting all of the conditions described above. Since that time, Federal Migration Service officials have repeatedly stated that aid is on the way. On a visit yesterday (December 1), Human Rights Watch researchers found no change in basic conditions in Sleptsovsk-North in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, people fleeing Chechnya continue to be subjected to bombardment along their escape routes and solicited for bribes by Russian forces at checkpoints and border crossings. Human Rights Watch collects almost daily testimony on these abuses, as well as on sporadic closures of the Ingush-Chechen border, which sometimes leave those traveling in either direction stranded in the cold and snow for two or three days. Human Rights Watch called on the Russian authorities to ensure protection and assistance for the internally displaced in Ingushetia. It urged the government to ensure full and unimpeded access for international agencies, as well as necessary security, in order provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and other parts of Russia.  Human Rights Watch also urged international donors to respond generously to the $16.2 million United Nations Inter-Agency Flash Appeal for the northern Caucasus.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Children's Rights, United Nations"

Human Rights Watch also expressed concern that the Palestinian Legislative Council members who signed the petition may still be subject to arrest at a later date. The council has been under pressure to lift their immunity, and voted thirty-three to eight today to condemn the petition and set up a committee to monitor council members' behavior.

Hojatoleslam Nouri, a former minister of interior and a close associate of President Khatami, was convicted on charges that his newspaper published articles that """"defamed the system"""" and spread lies and propaganda against the state. We believe that Hojatoleslam Nouri's prosecution and conviction was aimed at punishing him for exercising his fundamental right to freedom of expression and intended to exclude him from running as a candidate in the February 2000 parliamentary elections . As you will be aware, some observers have predicted he would not only win the elections if eligible to stand but could also become the next Speaker of Parliament. In February this year he won the highest number of votes in the elections for local municipalities. Human Rights Watch calls for his immediate and unconditional release and for assurances that his unwarranted conviction will not be used to exclude him from the election process in February 2000.  Nouri's prosecution is based on Iranian legislation that is open to interpretation allowing sweeping and arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression and reflects the urgent need to institute legal and administrative safeguards to protect free speech and press freedom. Of particular concern are article 24 of the Iranian constitution, which allows broadly conceived limits on expression by declaring that restrictions are appropriate when the material in question """"is detrimental to the fundamentals of Islam"""" and the Press Law of 1985, which contains similar broadly-worded language giving the government licence to clamp down on press freedom more or less at will.  The sweeping restrictions imposed through such laws are in clear violation of Article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a party, which states:  Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice...  We take this opportunity to reiterate the recommendations we made in our report on press freedom in Iran, As Fragile as a Crystal Glass, released in October this year in which we urged the government of Iran to:  -Amend the constitution in order to revise the sweeping language of article 24, so that restrictions on expression are in accord with the norms of free expression set out in article 19 of the ICCPR and other international instruments to which Iran is a party.  -Replace the Press Law of 1985 with legislation that maximizes the right to freedom of expression and ensure that any restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression are specific and narrowly defined so as not to place in jeopardy the right to free expression itself.  Human Rights Watch is further concerned about the fairness of Hojatolesalm Nouri's trial. We have in the past condemned trials before the Special Court of the Clergy, an extra-constitutional judicial body whose procedures are not public and fall far short of international standards for fair trial. While the trial of Hojatolesalm Nouri was exceptional in that it was in large part held in public and he was allowed to have the services of an attorney, the jury reached their verdict before Hojatoleslam Nouri had completed his defense, calling into question whether he benefited from the """"presumption of innocence."""" A further cause of concern was the composition of the nine-person jury, appointed solely by the judge, which included several prominent political figures, notably anti-reform officials such as Hojatoleslam Hosseinian, director general of the Islamic Propagation Society, who are known for their personal antipathy to proponents of reform.  In light of the above, Human Rights Watch calls on Your Excellency in your capacity as Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran to quash the conviction of Hojatoleslam Nouri, particularly as this case represents the latest in a series in which members of the clergy have been prosecuted for their opinions by this exceptional court. Until such time as the procedures of this court meet with the minimum international standards for fair trial, prosecutions before the Special Court for the Clergy should cease.  Ayatollah Khamenei, as Leader, you have a particular constitutional responsibility to ensure that the basic conditions necessary for free and fair elections, including the right to freedom of expression, are upheld. Freeing Hojatoleslam Nouri and others convicted for their opinions by this court, and abolishing the Special Court for the Clergy are essential steps in this regard.  I urge you to give this matter your urgent attention and look forward to a reply at your earliest convenience .

Gekhi, located about 20 kilometers southwest of Grozny, had already come under heavy bombardment by Russian forces on November 7-8. That attack, according to many eyewitnesses interviewed by a Human Rights Watch research team in Ingushetia, resulted in civilian casualties, left numerous houses in ruins, and severely damaged the local hospital. Many civilians, including women and children, still remain in Gekhi, and cannot flee due to dangerous conditions en route to Ingushetia. Human Rights Watch researchers gathered testimony in separate interviews with three of those wounded during Sunday's incident in Gekhi. Their accounts fully corresponded to each other. The three wounded men— """"Islam,"""" 34 years old, """"Hasan,"""" 49 years old, and """"Lyoma,"""" 47 years old— recounted to Human Rights Watch how in recent weeks, rebel fighters regularly entered Gekhi from Urus-Martan to fire on Russian positions located several kilometers away, and then withdrew immediately. This strategy would regularly attract Russian fire. Close to one week ago, residents established a checkpoint in the center of Gekhi on the road leading to Urus-Martan. Soon after the checkpoint was established, the witnesses told Human Rights Watch, Russian firing on Gekhi ceased. Three days ago, elders from Gekhi met with Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, the commander of Russian forces in western Chechnya, in Achkhoi-Martan. Gen. Shamanov reportedly assured the elders that if Russian forces were not fired upon, they would not return fire on Gekhi. Islam recounted that on November 28 at 2:00 p.m., he and four other men were staffing the checkpoint, unarmed, when about ten heavily-armed rebel fighters appeared, apparently from the direction of Urus-Martan. Islam said the rebel fighters dismissed pleas not to enter the town. """"Who is the eldest here?"""" one of them asked. """"Are you defending the village?"""" When the residents responded affirmatively, the rebels replied, """"And who do you think you are?"""" """"Then they started to shoot, at very close range, aiming straight at our legs"""" with 5.45-caliber automatics, said Islam. One bullet went directly through Islam's leg, while another lodged in his shin. Hasan received bullet wounds in both legs. He corroborated Islam's testimony. """"We provoked them in no way at all,"""" said Hasan. """"They want to get in to our village, to attack the Russian positions. But we don't have rebel fighters here, and we don't want them.""""

""""In its current form, the anti-terrorism law infringes on civil liberties and due process of law,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. Noting that the courts had been used selectively against political opponents by both the Sharif administration and the current military government, he added: """"The trial of Prime Minister Sharif gives the international community the chance to scrutinize the use of these courts, which sacrifice due process in the interest of speedy trials."""" Sharif, who was removed from office by the Pakistani military on Oct. 12, has been charged along with four other defendants with criminal conspiracy, attempted murder, hijacking, kidnaping, and terrorism. The charges stem from events on the day of the coup, when a civilian plane carrying army chief of staff General Pervez Musharraf and some 200 other passengers was prevented from landing at Karachi's airport, allegedly on Sharif's orders. Sharif and his co-defendants could be sentenced to life in prison or death if convicted. The Anti-Terrorism Act, which was passed by the parliament on August 16, 1997 and amended by an ordinance of the federal government on April 29, 1999, provides for the establishment of anti-terrorism courts to try persons charged with committing terrorist acts, and stipulates special procedures for the conduct of their trials. Under the Sharif administration, the courts were used against sectarian parties in Punjab province and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement in Sindh province, which draws support among Sindh's Urdu-speaking population. Courts established under the act are to conduct trials within seven days. Convicted persons have only seven days in which to file appeals, and these too must be heard and decided within a seven-day period. These provisions contravene international human rights principles of due process, including the right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of a defense, Human Rights Watch said. Pakistan's constitution, which was suspended by the military government following the coup, enshrines fundamental principles of due process as well. As defined under the law, terrorist acts include causing """"civil commotion""""— a term that is defined so broadly as to violate fundamental rights of free expression and assembly. Civil commotion includes the """"commencement or continuation of illegal strikes"""" as well as """"distributing, publishing or pasting of a handbill or making graffiti or wall-chalking intended to create unrest or fear."""" This provision has come under legal attack for its inconsistency with the Pakistan's constitution. Pakistan's Supreme Court announced Nov. 16 that it would issue guidelines governing its application. Although noting that guidelines would be an improvement, Human Rights Watch called for the repeal of the provision. The rights group also urged the repeal of the act's provisions restricting the time available for the preparation of a defense to criminal charges.

Tens of thousands of displaced civilians from all over Chechnya have reportedly gathered in Goyty, which had gained a reputation among civilians as a safe haven. """"Russia must immediately establish a cease fire along the exit routes from Goyty so that displaced civilians may leave safely,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division said. """"Any further attack on a village with such concentration of civilians is likely to cause large numbers of civilian casualties."""" After the November 21 attack, displaced persons began to flee Goyty. But the routes from Goyty to the Ingush border have been periodically strafed by Russian forces. (See, Russian Forces Fire on Fleeing Civilians, HRW Release, November 18, 1999). It remains unclear how Russian forces will treat Goyty in the days to come. On November 23, the Russian media carried conflicting reports about the village. Some suggested that Goyty would not be taken by force, indicating that a deal may have been struck between Russian forces and village elders. But others quoted the United Federal Forces on both November 23 and 24 to the effect that bombardment of Goyty would continue. Chechens who had just arrived in Ingushetia from Goyty told Human Rights Watch researchers that Russian artillery shelled the center of Goyty on November 21, starting at around 9:00 p.m. The shelling of the village apparently lasted for several hours, although one witness said the center was targeted for only about fifteen minutes. The attack was the first on the village center; previously, Russian forces had shelled only the immediate surroundings. Zura Aidamirova—a woman from Alkhan-Yurt who spent two weeks in Goyty—recalled that she was drinking tea in the school building on Ulitsa Sovetskaia (a street in Goyty), where she and her family were staying, when the shelling started. She said she immediately dropped to the floor as shrapnel hit the school. """"Zaindi,"""" a fifty-nine-year-old former school teacher from Urus-Martan, told Human Rights Watch that at least seven people were killed during the attack on Goyty, including two children, aged five and seventeen; a man in his late fifties; and three women. He also said that at least one other person had died on another street. He reported that his host in Goyty buried the seven bodies the day after the attack at a cemetery close to Goyty. Most other witnesses with whom Human Rights Watch spoke estimated the number of civilians killed at five to eight. """"Zaindi"""" said that various streets in the center were targeted but that Gagarin Street was hit most severely and that some twenty houses were damaged as a result of the shelling. Following the attack, Zaindi said he helped extinguish a fire that was sparked by a shell that had hit a shed with hay. Another witness said that Kirov Street was hit as well. Over the last months, Goyty has become the destination for tens of thousands of civilians fleeing other towns in Chechnya, apparently due to its reputation for being a safe haven. """"Zaindi"""" maintained that the local municipal council of Goyty had registered 114,000 people in the village, about one hundred thousand people more than its peacetime population. Although many of these people may have traveled on from Goyty to other places, it seems apparent that Goyty has a high concentration of displaced civilians, perhaps tens of thousands. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that almost every home in Goyty hosts several displaced families, sometimes up to forty people per house, and that many also are staying in schools, libraries and mosques. The displaced appear to come from all over Chechnya, but there are particularly large numbers from Urus-Martan and Grozny. Both Urus-Martan and Grozny have been subjected to intense bombing and shelling in recent weeks. Many Chechens told Human Rights Watch that they had heard a rumor that Goyty was a safe haven for civilians. Although Human Rights Watch was unable to confirm the source of this rumor, almost all Chechens —even those who did not come from Goyty— had heard about it. Many of these new arrivals spoke of difficult conditions as they fled from Goyty to Ingushetia. """"Zaindi"""" traveled to Ingushetia via Urus-Martan and Gekhi, which were both under heavy bombardment by Russian troops. He told Human Rights Watch: """"You can't tell when they're going to shoot. If the weather is clear, the planes come out at 6:30 a.m. And artillery fires at any time—day or night. The road is in ruins."""" People are also unable to flee along the Baku-Rostov highway, as this road is currently the stage of heavy fighting between Russian and Chechen forces. Human Rights Watch calls on the Russian government and the Chechen authorities to implement immediately a well-publicized cease-fire along the route from Goyty to the Ingush border to enable civilians to flee Goyty.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

""""The administration must couple its efforts to make China a more reliable trading partner with serious parallel pressure for significant improvements in human rights,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director for the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"China must go beyond opening its markets to opening its jails, easing restrictions on the press and the Internet, and protecting rights of workers."""" Human Rights Watch does not take a position on trade agreements per se, and does not endorse any particular trade agreement, including the one signed by the U.S. and China. However, it believes the process of China's WTO entry can be most beneficial for human rights in China if it is combined with effective, sustained pressure for greater political as well as economic freedoms in the country. As part of a WTO deal, President Clinton says he will lobby Congress to give up the annual process of reviewing China's trade status and grant China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status. But before signing off on permanent NTR, Congress should set concrete, meaningful human rights conditions that Beijing must meet. For example, China should be required to ratify the two United Nations human rights treaties it has signed (the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights); take steps to begin dismantling the huge system of """"reeducation through labor"""" which allows officials to sentence thousands of citizens to labor camps each year for up to three years without judicial review; open up Tibet and Xinjiang to regular, unhindered access by U.N. human rights and humanitarian agencies, foreign press, and independent monitors; and review the sentences of more than 2,000 convicted """"counter-revolutionaries"""" with a view towards releasing most of them. Verifiable progress, not just promises, should be required. Another critical source of external pressure on Beijing is the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which convenes in Geneva for its next session on March 20, 2000. In the past, China has shown that it can be extraordinarily sensitive to possible condemnation by the Commission. In 1995, a resolution on China came within one vote of passing, and since then Beijing has expended major effort worldwide to keep any critical resolution off the Commission's agenda -- including by threatening to cut off trade deals or investment opportunities to governments that might support action. But if a resolution is to have any chance of success next year, a decision is needed now by the U.S. government and other of China's key trading partners to sponsor a resolution and begin high-level lobbying to line up support. Human Rights Watch believes that WTO membership won't itself reform the Chinese system or lead to political changes, but it could be an important catalyst over the long run if combined with consistent pressure from outside China. For instance, greater transparency in economic matters could increase demands and expectations -- both inside and outside China -- for more openness in other areas. Demands to modernize China's legal system to handle commercial disputes, as recommended by the World Bank and others, could lay the groundwork for an independent judiciary and the rule of law that might extend to the political and security realms. The closing of thousands of state-run enterprises could push workers to insist on greater collective decision-making on workplace issues and the need for a social safety net, exercising the right of free association guaranteed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which China signed in October 1997, but has not ratified. But WTO membership in itself will not guarantee this result. Economic openness could continue to be accompanied by tight restrictions on basic freedoms and a lack of governmental accountability. China might seek to build the rule of law in the economic sphere while continuing to pervert and undermine the rule of law elsewhere, as it has with the crackdown on Falun Gong and pro-democracy activists, carried out according to """"the rule of law."""" Heightened worker demands for the peaceful exercise of their rights could yield heightened repression. The difference between these two possible paths of development, opened by China's prospective membership in the WTO, lies to a great extent in whether Beijing's chief trading partners insist that China's compliance with international trade rules must be accompanied by respect for international human rights rules. Note: This statement is being issued in advance of the Seattle WTO ministerial meeting to clarify Human Rights Watch's November 15 statement on China's entry into the WTO.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Mengistu, who has lived in Zimbabwe since 1991, arrived in South Africa last week for medical treatment.   """"Mengistu's forces committed crimes against humanity, and South Africa has the right and the duty under international law to bring him to justice,""""said Peter Takirumbudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"So many of Africa's blood-stained dictators have retired into comfortable exile next door. We must stop this cycle of impunity.""""   Ethiopia has sought Mengistu's extradition to stand trial for organizing the """"Red Terror"""" campaign in which tens of thousands of opponents of his regime are believed to have been slaughtered in the 1970's and 80's. Zimbabwe refused the extradition requests. Mengistu is the leading defendant in trials of 2,000 former officials that began nearly five years ago in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Two men were sentenced to death in absentia this month in these trials.   Human Rights Watch, citing concerns about the fairness of the Ethiopian trials, has declined to press for Mengistu's return to Ethiopia. The group suggested, however, that South Africa could try Mengistu before its own courts. The South African constitution incorporates customary international law, which holds that all countries should exercise jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and torture. Alternatively, South Africa could extradite Mengistu to a country which is willing to prosecute the former dictator and guarantee a fair trial, the rights group said.   """"There are several options available to the South African government to ensure that Mengistu is finally brought to account for the crimes he committed against the Ethiopian people,"""" said Takirambudde. """"South Africa would set a terrible precedent if it just let Mengistu walk away.""""   From 1974 to 1991, Mengistu's """"Dergue"""" regime was responsible for human rights violations on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were tortured, murdered or """"disappeared."""" Tens of thousands of people were also killed as a result of humanitarian law violations committed during Ethiopia's many internal armed conflicts. Many others, perhaps more than 100,000, died as a result of forced relocations ordered by the Mengistu regime. These violations are documented in Human Rights Watch's 1991 book-length report Evil Days: 30 Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia.   Human Rights Watch also called on South Africa to enact domestic legislation implementing its obligation under the U.N. torture convention, which South Africa ratified in 1998, to prosecute or extradite accused torturers who enter its territory, as well as to establish its jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed anywhere in the world.   In the wake of the October 1998 arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Human Rights Watch has campaigned to bring other former tyrants to justice.

""""Aceh doesn't need more soldiers in charge, it needs more soldiers on trial,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. The Indonesian military and police have been putting increasing pressure on President Abdurrahman Wahid to declare a state of emergency in Aceh. Most government offices have stopped functioning in the province as popular demands for a referendum on independence have escalated and pro-referendum rallies have become almost a daily occurrence. There are widespread fears of unrest on December 4, the twenty-third anniversary of a declaration of independence by Acehnese separatists. Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision of the Indonesian parliament yesterday to call in senior military officers for questioning about military operations during the early 1990s that resulted in widespread killing, disappearances, torture, rape, and arbitrary arrests. """"This process of questioning is a start, but it has to be followed with indictments and prosecutions,"""" said Saunders. """"This crisis is not going to be defused unless there is a sense in Aceh that justice has been done, and not just for a handful of cases."""" Earlier this month, a special fact-finding commission appointed by then-President Habibie in July announced it had found military culpability in """"five spectacular cases. """" Indonesia's new Human Rights Minister Hasballah Saad, himself Acehnese, called for immediate prosecution of these cases, but all occurred within the last four years, none address the pattern of systematic abuse that has characterized military operations in Aceh, and military officials have insisted that alleged perpetrators be tried before military tribunals. """"If accountability is to have any meaning, the Indonesian government will have to conduct a comprehensive investigation going back to 1989, and going all the way up the military chain of command,"""" said Saunders. He noted that a few attacks by rebels belonging to the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM) had prompted the Soeharto government to declare Aceh a military operations area (derah operasi militer or DOM). That designation lasted from May 1990 to August 1998 and effectively gave the army license to commit human rights violations against the civilian population without fear of sanction. """"Today, a declaration of martial law in Aceh would be the same as reinstituting DOM,"""" Saunders said. """"It will mean military impunity, unchecked abuses, and more resentment in Aceh toward the central government. This is not the way to address the crisis."""" Movement for an East Timor-style referendum has been building in Aceh since late January, fueled by anger at the unfulfilled promises of the Habibie government to address past abuses. While some local commanders of GAM, an armed insurgency, have supported calls for a referendum, the movement has been overwhelmingly civilian-led and nonviolent. The Habibie government ignored the depth, breadth, and passion of the movement, leading the various civilian groups involved — students and religious leaders in particular — to harden their demands. In recent weeks, Indonesia's new president, Abdurrahman Wahid, has repeatedly said he supports a referendum in Aceh, agreeing to a vote within seven months, but he has so far not agreed that such a vote would include the option of independence. The Indonesian military, and many within the Indonesian parliament, are adamantly opposed to any referendum at all, fearing that it would lead to the break-up of Indonesia. It is this impasse, between a grassroots-based independence movement and a military determination to stop it, that has raised the spectre of martial law and perhaps major bloodshed. """"At this point, there are no easy solutions to the standoff,"""" Saunders added. """"But one thing is clear: the national police and military leadership don't understand the depth of the alienation in Aceh. They continue to act as if armed intervention can re-establish security. Acehnese of every stripe have made it abundantly clear that Indonesian security forces are part of the problem.""""","Asia, Indonesia",""

Maduna,   Although we have not received a response to our letter, we have read statements in the press, attributed to Foreign ministry spokesman Khangelani Hlongwane, that South Africa will not bring Mengistu to justice because he is a """"refugee,"""" because South Africa does not have an extradition treaty with Ethiopia, and because it would be inconsistent to insist on Mengistu's prosecution, given South Africa's reconciliation process. Respectfully, we would like to address each of these assertions.   First, Mengistu Haile Mariam is not deserving of the international protection offered to refugees, pursuant to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. As you know, that Convention specifically excludes from protection """"any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that ...he has committed ... a war crime, or a crime against humanity."""" Similar terms are used in the 1969 OAU Convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in Africa. South Africa is a party to both these conventions. Mengistu is accused of both war crimes and crime against humanity. From 1974 to 1991, Mengistu and his subordinates were responsible for atrocities on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were tortured, murdered or """"disappeared."""" Tens of thousands more were killed as a result of war crimes. Many others, probably well in excess of 100,000, died as a result of forced relocations ordered by Mengistu's regime.   Second, in our letter, we did not recommend that South Africa extradite Mengistu to Ethiopia, because of our concerns regarding his right to a fair trial and the application of the death penalty. We did urge, however, that South Africa investigate Mengistu before its own courts. The South African constitution (article 232) expressly incorporates customary international law. Under customary international law, all countries have a right and a duty to exercise jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and a right to exercise such jurisdiction over torture. We also note that South Africa in 1988 ratified the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which requires South Africa to prosecute or extradite accused torturers-such as Mengistu-who enter its territory. South Africa has not, however, met its treaty commitment by enacting implementing legislation to incorporate this.   Finally, we believe that it is a disservice to the South African truth and reconciliation process to use that carefully-devised mechanism as a pretext to provide impunity to one of the most blood-stained tyrants of modern times, a man who has never told the truth about his crimes, who has never sought nor received an amnesty and whose government wishes to prosecute him for crimes against humanity. In South Africa, amnesty from prosecution was predicated on truth-telling, which Mengistu has not done. In addition, the route to reconciliation is not something for others to decide but for each country to determine for itself. Ethiopia has clearly decided that reconciliation is best achieved through justice - a fair assessment given the horrendous atrocities committed. South Africa should not seek to impose its model on a fellow country.   South Africa is regarded as a country which places the highest value on human rights. Our organization has had the privilege of working with your government in developing an effective International Criminal Court to bring to justice those accused of the worst atrocities. We believe that South Africa has an opportunity to break the unfortunate cycle of impunity that has developed in many parts of Africa by bringing Mengistu to justice before its courts and providing him with a fair trial.   Thank you in advance for your consideration.   Yours truly,   Peter Takirambudde Africa Director","Africa, Ethiopia, South Africa","International Justice"

Known as the """"Derg"""" or """"Dergue,"""" the """"committee,"""" the junta consisted of about a hundred junior officers drawn from all regions of Ethiopia. Proclaiming a revolutionary agenda for the country, the Dergue inaugurated its rule by sending some sixty senior officials of the emperor's government to the firing squad. The emperor and the Patriarch of the dominant Ethiopian Orthodox church were both secretly killed in the months that followed. The Dergue's early victims included members of the group itself. Col. Mengistu emerged as its undisputed leader after orchestrating the physical elimination of rivals from within.   In 1976 Col. Mengistu gave a dramatic send-off to a campaign of terror that he officially dubbed the """"Red Terror."""" He threw to the ground before a huge crowd in the capital Addis Ababa bottles filled with a red substance representing the blood of enemies of the revolution: the """"imperialists,"""" and the """"counter-revolutionaries,"""" as members of rival leftist groups were labeled by the Dergue. In particular, the campaign targeted students and young people suspected of membership in the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP). Thousands of young men and women turned up dead in the streets of the capital and other cities in the following two years. They were systematically eliminated mainly by militia attached to the """"Kebeles,"""" the neighborhood watch committees which served during the Dergue period as the lowest level local government and security surveillance units. The Kebeles required families to reimburse the administration for the price of bullets used to kill victims when they reclaimed their bodies for burial.     The process of eliminating the """"counter-revolutionaries"""" was quite organized. Each neighborhood committee would meet to discuss how to eliminate individual suspects, and each member would sign on documents to confirm the decision reached at the meeting. Copies of the document would be sent to different levels of the administrations and the party apparatus. The centralized killing enterprise thus left mountains of documentary evidence of its crimes.     Cold war rivalries helped the Dergue to flourish and tighten its hold on power. It became the main client of the Soviet block in Africa, and received massive shipments of arms to help it counter serious challenges from several armed insurgencies by ethnic and regional liberation movements seeking to break away from centuries of centralized hegemony by Ethiopia's ruling elite. The counter-insurgency campaigns unleashed by the Dergue were characterized by widespread violations of international humanitarian law. Civilians were deliberately targeted and fell victims by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the indiscriminate violence against them.     When famine in 1984 hit areas in northern Ethiopia partially held by rebels of the Tigray and Eritrean People's Liberation Fronts (TPLF and EPLF respectively), Mengistu's government for a while blacked out information about the famine. It later used the disaster as a pretext to forcibly relocate hundreds of thousands of villagers from northern Ethiopia to areas in the south. The Dergue argued that its """"villagization"""" campaign, as it came to be known, was meant to relocate people from food deficient areas to the fertile plains of the south. In reality, the move was meant to empty rebel-held areas form potential supporters. Again, victims of government action during the forced relocation were in the hundreds of thousands. A 1991 Human Rights Watch report, """"Evil Days: 30 years of war and famine in Ethiopia,"""" gives a detailed account of this dark period in Ethiopia's recent history during which it is estimated that at least half a million civilians were killed as a result of the Dergue actions.     The Dergue was deposed in 1991 by the Ethiopian people's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of regional and ethnic rebel groups led by the TPLF. In the province of Eritrea the EPLF established a provisional government that steered the province to full independence by 1993, with the blessing and cooperation of its former ally the TPLF.     In 1992 the new government established a Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) to investigate the widespread crimes committed during the Dergue period and prosecute those responsible for them. However, the trials on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity of the seventy-two top-ranking Dergue officials, including Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had fled to Zimbabwe shortly before the fall of Addis Ababa to the EPRDF, are still pending. As for the majority of those detained in relation to their suspected role during the Dergue dictatorship, it was only in the first quarter of 1997 that the SPO announced their charging with criminal offences. In January 1997 the Office charged a total number of 5,198 people, of whom 2,246 were already in detention, while 2,952 were charged in absentia. The vast majority of the defendants were charged with genocide and war crimes, and faced alternative charges of having committed aggravated homicide and wilful injury. All charges were based on the Ethiopian penal code of 1957. New additional trials of Dergue era defendants opened before the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa during March 1997. However, a serious crisis in the Ethiopian judiciary has left federal courts with a backlog of thousands of """"ordinary cases."""" These court proceedings are now running into constant delays. Many of the defendants were in pre-trial detention for almost six years before they were first brought to court.     The SPO subdivided the defendants in three groups by degree of responsibility: policy and decision makers; intermediary level officials who relayed orders, but initiated some decisions on their own; and the hands directly involved in committing the crimes. Mirroring the Dergue's preferred mode of operation, the SPO had structured the prosecutions by committee, leading to 172 cases, each of multiple defendants. There is no special tribunal hearing the Dergue cases. They are heard in both the central and regional courts of Ethiopia's decentralized federal court system. The SPO opted to prosecute the central authorities, such as the central politburo of the Dergue, in the central court system, and prosecute cases of other suspects in regions where they operated.     As the leader of the Dergue, Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam is already being tried in absentia, together with his closest collaborators. But the manner in which the trials are being conducted has caused serious concerns to Human Rights Watch. In particular, excessive delays in the investigative phase led to the pretrial detention of hundreds of suspects for years at length. Additionally, Ethiopian law provides for the death penalty. Two Dergue officials were sentenced to death in absentia this month in these trials. Trial lawyers repeatedly complained about due process flaws in that their access to their detained clients was rendered difficult because of restrictions imposed by the government. The government was also slow in providing legal representation to some of the defendants.","Africa, Ethiopia",""

Dozens of people interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that their homes had been stripped of all foodstuffs and valuables -- sometimes including the floorboards -- by groups of armed soldiers, who sometimes came ready with military vehicles to carry away their loot. """"Looting was a terrible problem in the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"It is a violation of international humanitarian law, and it must be stopped."""" Soldiers have not only looted basic food supplies stored for winter, but also taken anything of value from homes, often after their inhabitants have fled. As displaced persons have begun to filter back into Russian-controlled areas, they have found their homes emptied. Some of those people have then returned to Ingushetia in search of food and shelter. Markha Isaeva, from the village of Mekenskaia in the Naurskii district, reported that when she returned to her house in mid-November from Ingushetia, it was stripped practically bare. Soon after her return, she witnessed how soldiers took mattresses, pillows, and even ripped the floorboards and window frames from her neighbors' home. When she asked the soldiers why they were taking them, they answered: """"We've got to have fuel for our stoves...we've got to build shields for our positions ['blindazhi,' in Russian]."""" Isaeva had fled her home during bombing in the beginning of October. """"Zina,"""" a 43-year-old agronomist, left her village of Assinovskaia—close to the Ingush border— on October 7 and returned on the afternoon of November 18 to find it emptied of all dishes, bedding, canned goods, and other food supplies, as well as the television and VCR. She said that when she entered her house, a soldier was standing in the main room pulling an electrical outlet out of the wall. """"I put in that outlet myself,"""" she recounted, """"and I asked him, ‘Why are you tearing it out of the wall?' and he said ‘I need it.'"""" Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses to looting in the town of Sernovodsk, about five kilometers north of Assinovskaia. Zara Magomadova, 47, told Human Rights Watch, """"My own cow, they killed it before my eyes and hauled it away...My chickens, right in front of me, they went like this [making a strangling motion with two hands] and took them too."""" Sheima Mazaeva recounted in detail how soldiers took household goods from number 2, number 14, and number 18 Assinovskaia Street. She said that soldiers came to her house, opened the gates and asked, """"Do you have a cow or a bull?"""" They then searched her yard and found nothing. """"Lucky for you, you don't have anything,"""" they told her. She reported that soldiers came back to the houses on the street nearly every day to check for more goods. """"The same ones came again and again—I know their faces now,"""" Mazaeva told Human Rights Watch. On another occasion they asked her """"Granny, do you have any flour?"""" She said they took the only bag of flour she had. """"Leila,"""" 53, from Sernovodsk, returned to her home on November 17 at 10:20 a.m. She said that her television, VCR, radio, bed linens, mattresses, rugs, and clothing were missing. """"The only thing they left was the refrigerator,"""" she told Human Rights Watch. She said she saw soldiers drive a military truck with a wagon into the courtyard belonging to her neighbor, Salam Shavkhalov. According to """"Leila,"""" there were fifteen soldiers with machine guns loading household goods, including a refrigerator, onto the truck. On November 15, Ruslan Baisugurov, 32, was visiting his parents in the village of Ermolovskii. As his car was stalled on a residential street, he saw two armored personnel carriers drive up. He told Human Rights Watch that he saw several soldiers go up to the first house they came upon and start to load household goods into the back of the vehicles: mattresses, pillows, blankets, rugs. """"They took everything, loaded it quickly and left,"""" he told Human Rights Watch. Other witnesses have related incidents of soldiers taking the clothes off the backs of civilians on the street. According to Dagman Agmanova, a soldier took the coat off the back of her friend, Zora Adueva, in Sernovodsk on November 17. She said the soldier reportedly did not return to Mrs. Aduev her documents, which were in the coat pocket. At least five witnesses expressed to Human Rights Watch their conviction that any attempt to complain to Russian commanders about looting would be senseless. The Russian army command in Chechnya has recently encouraged residents to return to the towns of Sernovodsk and Assinovskaia, among others now under their control. Many displaced people interviewed at the Chechen-Ingush border said they were heading back to their homes to prevent them from being looted by the Russian forces. According to Ingush border guards, 1114 people returned to Chechnya on November 19, while 1802 people entered Ingushetia.

""""But it ignores a number of critical human rights benchmarks that are essential to building confidence in any peacetime police service in Northern Ireland."""" Human Rights Watch welcomed the commission's statement that policing in Northern Ireland should be conducted using a """"human rights based approach"""" but noted that the commission does not make recommendations to address a number of serious concerns about policing and human rights. Most notably, the commission did not recommend a vetting mechanism to weed out officers currently serving in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) who have past records of human rights violations. The group argues that in the absence of a commission of inquiry into the role of the security forces during the conflict or a truth commission modeled along the lines of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a vetting mechanism for accountability for past human rights violations by the police would have at least laid a firm foundation for the future policing arrangements that the commission so carefully contemplated. """"There should be a strong message sent that abuses will not be tolerated in the new policing service,"""" said Hall. """"This is the only fair mechanism by which chronic abusers would be made to answer as individuals for such terrible violations."""" The group's assessment welcomes the establishment of a Police Board and the commission's call for transparency in policing operations. Recommendations include creating new policing legislation to fully implement the Patten Commission's proposals. The assessment poses a set of questions regarding how legislation on covert policing will interface with the work of the new police ombudsman. The group expresses """"profound disappointment"""" that the Patten Commission did not take a stronger position in support of the repeal of the emergency laws and an outright ban on plastic bullets.

Two eyewitnesses independently confirmed that on the morning of November 1, a Russian unit that had taken up a position at the Zakan-Iurt psychiatric hospital the previous night fired on the doctors and nurses who came in the morning to care for their patients. """"This attack is a grave breach of international humanitarian law,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The Russian government claims it is doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties, but that is simply not true."""" Human Rights Watch investigators in Ingushetia separately interviewed chief medical orderly Umar Uzarov and head nurse Dagman Tepsurkaeva -- one in the Sunzha district hospital and one in Galashki hospital -- and both described the incident in detail. Their accounts fully corresponded to each other. Uzarov and Tepsurkaeva told Human Rights Watch that their hospital, clearly marked with the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross, harbored no enemy forces and was home to approximately 30 defenseless patients. Staff members arriving at the hospital came under a twenty-minute siege by Russian troops dug in along the road close to the hospital gates. According to Uzarov's account, the protected nature of the hospital was clear: """"The psychiatric hospital is located on the Sunzha ridge, close to the town of Samashki. It is an isolated building; no one lives nearby. During the last war, we worked right through and didn't close the hospital once. This year, as the Russian forces approached, we made red cross flags from white material and hung them on all sides of the hospital buildings, to let them know that this is a hospital and that there are no fighters here."""" """"On October 31 we finished work for the day and locked up the building. We didn't see any Russian soldiers, but we were afraid that they might come during the night,"""" continued Uzarov. At 8:00 a.m on November 1, Uzarov drove in a private car together with head doctor Rashid Dadaev, 50; chief accountant Alkhazur [last name unknown]; head nurse Tepsurkaeva; and secretary Khadishat Basaeva up to the hospital gates. Dr. Dadaev sat in the front passenger seat, holding a large white paper with a red cross up to the windshield of the car to mark it as a medical vehicle. The sign would have been clearly visible as the car approached the hospital. The firing began as the chief accountant got out of the car and opened the hospital gates. """"Rashid and I both yelled at the others to get out of the car and lie flat,"""" recalled Uzarov; the others jumped out of the car and into the drainage ditches on either side of the road. """"They shot at us for about twenty minutes, from machine guns, and twice they used a grenade launcher [in Russian, """"iz podstvolnika""""].... We were in the ditches, and near the fields there were trenches, where I guess the soldiers were. They were 17-18 meters [about 50 feet] away from us...We thought it was the end for us...After about 15 or 20 minutes we saw 15 of them moving towards us--they weren't young ones, they looked about 30 or 35 years old. Some of them were shooting in the air, some towards the ground. I had the red cross in my hand, and I told the women to start crying so that they don't kill us...They swore at us and told us to get up and go to the hospital gate with our hands up."""" Dr. Dadaev, however, did not respond. One of the soldiers opened the car door with his gun and asked them, """"Who's this?"""" Uzarov then understood that Dr. Dadaev had been hit while still in the car. He replied, """"That's our head doctor."""" Basaeva was hit by shrapnel; Tepsurkaeva was wounded in the leg and pelvis; Uzarov received superficial bullet and shrapnel wounds. The group returned to Zakan-Iurt on foot after soldiers allowed Uzarov to take Dadaev's body back to the village on a hospital cart. On November 6, Uzarov attempted to return to the hospital, after Said, a village elder from Zakan-Iurt, reportedly negotiated with the soldiers to allow personnel to tend to patients remaining there. At 1:50 p.m., as Saidand the Russian unit had agreed, Uzarov rode up on a red tractor with three cars ahead of it. Russian snipers suddenly opened fire, hitting Uzarov in the leg and shattering his left shin bone. The group of elders who rode with Uzarov began to shout, """"Don't shoot! What are you doing? In broad daylight! This is a hospital!"""" According Uzarov, the soldiers rode up to the building in an armored personnel carrier and drove off with Uzarov to their unit, where they gave him first aid, and issued him a document certifying that he had received medical treatment. At the end of the day they drove him back to the village. The fate of the hospital's patients remains unknown. Both Uzarov and Tepsurkaeva both noted that some of the patients would not be able to flee by themselves. International humanitarian law forbids attacks on civilians and civilian objects, such as hospitals. The Geneva Conventions specifically prohibit attacks on medical personnel and require Russian forces to respect and protect medical personnel, medical units, and medical transports, and to respect the emblem of the Red Cross. The Geneva Conventions also require that the sick be respected and protected, treated humanely, and granted necessary medical care.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Health, Attacks on Health"

Information from the sealed off area was still sketchy on Monday, but local informants reported to Human Rights Watch that large numbers of casualties were feared in indiscriminate reprisals against the civilian population. In January 1999, soldiers killed tens of people and seriously assaulted many others in the course of a similar military crackdown in the same area of Bayelsa State. """"This is the worst possible response to the unrest in the delta,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The rule of law clearly needs to be restored, but government lawlessness of this kind can only make the situation worse."""" Human Rights Watch called on the government to withdraw the soldiers immediately and use regular law enforcement measures to arrest those alleged to be responsible for the murder of the policemen. """"The government must draw a clear distinction between those who have carried out criminal acts and those who are exercising their constitutional rights to express their views, not to mention those who are simply bystanders,"""" said Takirambudde. """"On repeated recent occasions security forces have failed to do so."""" The rights group also called on oil companies operating in Nigeria publicly to express their concern to the government and to urge a negotiated solution to the problems of the delta. """"The oil companies who provide the wealth to Nigeria's government undoubtedly have an important influence on government policy in the delta,"""" Takirambudde said. """"They should condemn indiscriminate killings and urge respect for human rights."""" Since President Olusegun Obasanjo took office in May 1999, leaders from the oil producing communities have stepped up demands for more revenue sharing with the people living in the areas where oil is produced. Despite many decades of oil production, bringing billions of dollars to the Nigerian state, the Niger Delta region remains impoverished, and suffers the adverse environmental effects of oil production. The new government has made general promises that it intends to redress these grievances, but has taken few concrete steps to do so. """"What is needed is talking not shooting,"""" said Takirambudde. He warned that the latest troop movements were likely to inflame those militants in the delta who want to go to war. The current military operation is focused on Odi, a community in Bayelsa State just off the main east-west road that runs from Port Harcourt to Warri, the two most important towns in the oil producing region. Two weeks ago, several policemen were killed in the town by militant youths from the Ijaw ethnic group. The youths, described by local activists as """"lawless elements,"""" had been mobilizing to travel to Lagos where Ijaws had been faring badly in violent clashes with members of the Yoruba Oodua People's Congress. Following the deaths of the policemen, President Obasanjo threatened to declare a state of emergency in Bayelsa State if their killers were not arrested within two weeks. That ultimatum expires this Wednesday, but appears to have been preempted by the weekend's military action. There had been no official announcement about the crackdown by Monday morning. Current reports from Delta State indicate that paramilitary Mobile Police are also engaging in indiscriminate attacks on communities in Isoko North and South local government areas, where there has been recent inter-community conflict.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Many of these children go on to spend months or even years in overcrowded detention facilities awaiting the conclusion of their trials.  Research and interviews for the 147-page Report, """"Prison Bound: The Denial of Juvenile Justice in Pakistan,"""" were conducted before the October military coup which deposed the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Human Rights Watch has no evidence that the treatment of juvenile detainees has improved since the coup. The treatment of children in detention violates Pakistani law, as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly ten years ago this Saturday and ratified by Pakistan a year later. Despite a law that requires police to bring criminal suspects before a judge within twenty-four hours of arrest, children may spend as long as three months in detention before seeing a judge. Children share their cells with adults while in police custody, and like adult detainees, are routinely subjected to various forms of torture or ill-treatment, including being beaten, hung upside down, or whipped with a rubber strap or specially-designed leather slipper. In May 1998, Ghulam Jillani, a thirteen-year-old boy, died after prolonged torture in a police station in the northern town of Mansehra. Riots following Jillani's funeral prompted provincial authorities to arrest the head constable of the Mansehra police station and order a judicial investigation into the boy's death. But far more often, police abuses against child detainees go unreported and unpunished. Human Rights Watch said that children who are tortured have no impartial authority to whom they can report their grievances. """"Pakistani authorities have to address this justice crisis for children,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It's a matter of the utmost urgency. Such treatment cannot remain the norm."""" More than 3700 children were in Pakistan prisons at the end of 1997. About 90 percent were awaiting the conclusion of their trials—a process that can take months or even years due to the delayed submission of police investigation reports and the frequent adjournment of hearings. The few children who are ultimately convicted tend to receive harsh, retributive sentences. In February 1998, there were fifty-five children on death row in Punjab province. Death sentences imposed on juveniles are usually commuted on appeal, although Pakistan is one of only six countries that are known to have executed juvenile offenders during the 1990s. The Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly prohibits imposing the death penalty on children under the age of eighteen. Most of the facilities in which children are held suffer from severe overcrowding. The juvenile ward of Lahore District Jail, which Human Rights Watch researchers visited, holds nearly three times as many children as it was designed for. Children in the jail sleep without mattresses on bare cement floors, or on raised cement blocks that serve as beds. Most prisons offer few educational or vocational training opportunities, other than religious instruction. Although prisons in Pakistan's major cities have segregated wards for juveniles, children are housed with adults in some of the country's smaller jails. Human Rights Watch also gathered credible accounts of sexual abuse of juveniles by prison guards as well as the involvement of guards in supplying illegal drugs to inmates, including children. Two of Pakistan's four provinces, Punjab and Sindh, have laws providing for the establishment of juvenile courts and vocational training schools, but these have largely not been implemented. Only in the city of Karachi, which has both a functioning juvenile court and a separate juvenile institution, are the rudiments of a juvenile justice system in place. Human Rights Watch called on the Pakistani authorities to establish independent bodies to hear and investigate complaints of abuse by police and prison personnel, and to ensure the strict separation of adults and children deprived of their liberty. Authorities should also provide sufficient teaching staff and modern vocational training in each facility housing juveniles, and prohibit imposition of the death penalty on children under the age of eighteen.

Another added, """"Our children are in prison, but they are not criminals, they are not thieves, they just read ‘namaz' [the Muslim five daily prayers]."""" A busload of police arrived on the scene as the women approached the entrance to the mayor's office. Approximately 15 officers—including uniformed police and several soldiers in camouflage surrounded the women—along with at least six officials from the mayor's office. The officials refused to grant the women's request for an audience with the mayor, advising them to return another day with a written appeal. After about 40 minutes of discussion, officials disbanded the demonstration and escorted the women away from the government building. Representatives from an international organization who arrived on the scene as the women were being disbanded reported that plain clothes officers presumed to be from the National Security Service (SNB, formerly the KGB) followed several of the women as they descended into a nearby metro station. A Human Rights Watch representative who witnessed the protest noted that police and officials from the mayor's office attempted to take down the names of the protesters. They reportedly succeeded in videotaping all of those gathered. In past years, such police video recordings of demonstrations have allegedly been used to locate participants, who were later arrested on charges of anti-state activity or called in for questioning about their political views. The women came to appeal to local government officials on behalf of their relatives, who are religious Muslims arrested during the past sixth months on allegedly fabricated charges of narcotics and weapons possession and also for alleged possession of leaflets produced by the unregistered Islamic group Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Regardless of the justification for their original detention or arrest, the men were all charged with violating article 159 of the criminal code (encroachment upon the constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan). Some received prison sentences ranging from eight to ten years. The situation for those in pre-trial detention appeared particularly precarious. One woman reported that her husband, detained two months ago, is still missing in police custody. Others related similar accounts, and said they were searching desperately for their missing relatives. Many of the women complained also of the harsh conditions they are forced to live under while their husbands, brothers, and sons are in prison. One 46-year-old woman described the economic hardship brought on by the absence of male family members: """"My husband died, my son has been arrested and now we have two women in the house and four children. How can we live? We eat only bread, we don't have meat or butter."""" A 50-year-old woman described how police put her under administrative arrest for 15 days because of her inability to pay rent after her husband went to prison. The last known protest of this scale in Tashkent was held in January 1998, when about 100 female relatives of men detained and arrested because of their religious affiliation gathered outside a Tashkent police station to demand the immediate release of their male family members. That protest was dispersed by police, who detained several of the women and levied fines against the alleged organizers of the demonstration.

With an election assessment team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Tashkent and world leaders in Istanbul this week for the OSCE summit, Human Rights Watch urges the international community to insist that Uzbekistan comply with the human rights components of its international agreements.  Human Rights Watch has independently documented a pattern of police arrest, detention, and harassment of family members of political activists and religious dissidents during the past six months.  There is also a wealth of credible evidence that police routinely plant small amounts of narcotics or ammunition on persons whom they arrest for their political or religious affiliation.  Bekjanov is serving a ten-year prison sentence after being condemned in a politically motivated trial on fabricated charges of illegal narcotics and weapons possession.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Bekjanov was arrested and tried solely because of his brother's political activity and prominence as head of the political opposition party Erk.  """"The government of Uzbekistan professes to be preparing for free and fair elections, but at the same time it is locking up the opposition's family members and throwing away the key,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is no way to achieve democracy.""""  Authorities reportedly transferred Bekjanov from Urgench prison on July 18, but have failed to give his relatives any information regarding his current location.  His relatives' own attempts to locate Bekjanov by going from prison to prison have proven fruitless, as prison authorities as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the regional prosecutor's office refuse to respond to their queries.  Solih was the only candidate to run against President Islam Karimov in the presidential elections of 1991.  He was forced into exile in 1994, fleeing an arrest on fabricated criminal charges.  He has denied the Karimov government's latest allegations that he was one of the organizers of the February 16 bombings in Tashkent.  Two of Solih's other brothers, Rashid and Muhammad Bekjanov, were tried and convicted along with four others in August in a politically motivated case that raised alarm in the international community. Although the defendants described the torture police used during interrogation to force them to incriminate themselves, the presiding judge ignored them and the defendants' own exculpatory testimony and sentenced them to lengthy prison terms.  Komil Bekjanov (age 47) was first detained by police on February 19, 1999, in Khorezm (western Uzbekistan) where they interrogated him continuously for three days.  Questioning reportedly centered exclusively on the activities of his brother Solih.  Officers reportedly promised to release Bekjanov and leave him alone if his brother would return to Uzbekistan to take his place.  On February 22, police temporarily released Bekjanov only to arrest him again on March 31. This time, they reportedly planted opium and a pistol in his car in order to provide grounds for his arrest.  Bekjanov, who worked as a farmer in Khorezm and was not politically active, has denied the charges of weapons and narcotics possession.  After a three-day trial which Bekjanov's own lawyer was prevented from attending, on May 31, 1999, presiding judge Azad Karimov condemned Bekjanov to ten years in prison.  Uzbek police have arrested family members of independent Islamic leaders, as well as those related to political activists.  During the summer, the younger brother, uncle, and brother-in-law of independent imam Obidhon Qori Nazarov were all sent to prison.  Abdumalik Nazarov, the imam's youngest brother, was convicted earlier, in April 1998, on allegedly fabricated charges of possession of illegal narcotics.  He too has reportedly disappeared in custody and has not been seen since the end of May 1999.  Imam Nazarov himself was last seen March 5, 1998.

Upon arrival at the border, many were forced to pay bribes to Russian soldiers in order to cross into neighboring Ingushetia. In a letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, who is scheduled to meet with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday, Human Rights Watch has asked her to urge the Russian government to protect fleeing civilians. In the southern part of Chechnya, heavy bombing of civilian areas, including residences, continues. """"People are afraid even to go out of their houses to get firewood during the day,"""" said """"Ramazan,"""" age 27. He recounted daily shelling and bombing of Shatoi, a town approximately 40 miles south of Grozny. On November 7, he witnessed rocket attacks on his street, Naberezhnaia, at 3:45 p.m. The neighboring streets of Argunskaia, Sadovaia, and Bazarnaia were also hit. Three or four planes flew overhead and dropped bombs. Two of """"Ramazan's"""" neighbors went out into a nearby wooded area to gather fuel and were killed: Mula Shokhtemirov, and Maka Dadaeva. This information was confirmed in a separate interview with another resident of Shatoi, Said Khajimuradov, 37. According to him, 13 were wounded, six seriously. According to Human Rights Watch research, there may have been a legitimate military target in the area. Khajimuradov described how on November 11 he saw a rocket hit the district police station, which had a satellite antenna -- highly unusual equipment for a provincial police station. On November 11 at 8 a.m., """"Ramazan"""" (not the man's true name) witnessed small bomblets hit two homes on Naberezhnaia street, killing Anzor Akhmadov, 25, and Sultan Iangulbaev, 50. Other witnesses confirmed seeing unexploded bomblets in Shatoi during the last days of October. Lecha, a 38-year-old man from the mountain hamlet of Itum-Kale, twelve miles south of Shatoi, also described in detail the bombing of the village, especially at the end of October, when Mabary Suleimanov, Abdurashid Dadaev, and Roza Mursazalieva were killed. Bombings have also continued in western Chechnya. Achkoi Martan, approximately 12 miles southwest of Grozny, has endured heavy shelling. Eyewitnesses recounted civilian casualties on November 4, 7, and 8 in residential areas of the town. In most cases, residents were killed as they left their homes in search of food or fuel. Among the victims on November 7 were Zura Dataeva, her mother Palada Dataeva, son Aslan Dataev, and young daughter. """"Ruslan"""" (not the man's true name) reported that on the morning of November 15, as he and his family fled Urus Martan, a neighboring home in the north of the town was hit, killing an elderly man and a woman. His home was also hit by what he believed was a Grad missile, which he distinguished by its distinctive sound. He reported that for two weeks Urus Martan has been under heavy fire, with breaks only during the extremely cold weather from November 9-11. Civilians fleeing the bombing have also suffered casualties. Routes to safety from besieged towns remain effectively closed due to artillery and air bombardment. Particularly dangerous is a stretch of the Baku-Rostov highway—the principal artery crossing east-west through Chechnya to the Ingush border—that passes southwest of Grozny. """"Ramazan"""" left Shatoi on November 16 at 3:00 a.m. in a van with 15 people. At approximately 7:00 a.m., on the Baku-Rostov highway outside the town of Kulary, five shots rang out towards their vehicle from a Russian position on the left side of the road. One hit the vehicle, and seriously wounded 4-year- old Eliza Khabaeva. According to her father Isa, 38, she is now in the intensive care ward of Sunzhenskaia district hospital in Sleptsovsk. Kharon Askhabov, 35, said that he was unaware of any humanitarian corridor out of Urus Martan. He left on November 15 at 7:00 a.m. in a convoy of three cars with relatives. On the Baku-Rostov highway outside of Achkoi Martan, one of the cars was hit by a shell, and the seven passengers were killed: an old man, two women, and four children. """"Ruslan"""" from Urus Martan related that he saw two empty cars, one of them burning, the other with holes from shrapnel on the Baku-Rostov highway close to Zakan-Iurt on November 15. The passengers had presumably fled. Human Rights Watch notes that thousands of displaced persons flee each day on the Rostov-Baku highway. Any firing on this road, which, according to witness testimony, is frequent, runs the risk of striking civilian vehicles, endangering the lives of displaced persons. Human Rights Watch calls on the United Federal Forces to take all feasible measures to protect noncombatants fleeing for safety, including declaring periodic cease-fires. Human Rights Watch's letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees urged her to seek assurances from Prime Minister Putin that Russian forces would protect fleeing civilians from attacks; that corrupt border police would be disciplined; and that humanitarian organizations would have unfettered access to Chechnya, including areas under Russian control. Reaching the border is not the last hurdle the displaced must face before safety. Kharon Askhabov left Urus Martan on November 15. At the second control point after Assinovskii, federal soldiers demanded money from him, detaining him for forty minutes. When he answered that he had no money, they swore at him and threatened, """"If you don't give us some [money], you'll be last in this line, or you won't get across at all."""" He replied that in his car there were three women and seven children. They swore at him again. He had only 60 rubles for gasoline (approximately U.S.$2). The women in his car gathered 300 rubles so that the soldiers would let him through. Askhabov, who had left Ingushetia the day before to return to Chechnya to bring his family to safety, had already been forced to pay 400 rubles in order to enter Chechnya. Another displaced person interviewed at the Chechen-Ingush border recounted that on November 15, soldiers at the border demanded 100 rubles, ostensibly a fine for riding his motorcycle without a helmet.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/11/16/letter-unhcr-refugee-crisis-chechnya","Letter to UNHCR on Refugee Crisis in Chechnya","Letter to UNHCR on Refugee Crisis in Chechnya","","11/16/1999","In a letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, who is scheduled to meet with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday, Human Rights Watch has asked her to urge the Russian government to protect fleeing civilians.  Human Rights Watch currently has a rotating group of researchers in the region who are responsible for interviewing internally displaced persons, primarily in Ingushetia, in order to document the human rights abuses they have experienced or witnessed in Chechnya. In the course of our monitoring, we are paying particular attention to the plight of displaced persons, including treatment by the Russian authorities, restrictions on freedom of movement, and access to humanitarian assistance. We are aware of the precarious security conditions in the region and the serious limitations these place on UNHCR's ability to operate. Through our monitoring and research we have identified some serious problems facing internally displaced persons in the region and would like to request you to raise these with the Russian authorities in the course of your discussions over the coming days. Freedom of Movement and Access to Areas of Safety We welcomed your press statement on October 25, in which you raised grave concern over the fate of the tens of thousands of civilians who were trapped within Chechnya and unable to cross over into Ingushetia in order to escape the fighting and seek safety. We are aware that the Chechen-Ingush border has now officially opened and that on average several thousand people per day pass through. We remain deeply concerned at the continuing cumbersome bureaucratic border procedures which have caused long delays for some seeking to flee Chechnya and cross into Ingushetia, particularly those traveling in automobiles, given the onset of harsh weather. We are very concerned that international humanitarian agencies, such as UNHCR, will not have proper access to those waiting in line on the Chechen side, and that there is little, if any, humanitarian assistance reaching the displaced. This concern was heightened last week, when Russian authorities denied entry through the border to a visiting OSCE mission. Many internally displaced persons in Ingushetia have reported to Human Rights Watch that Russian border police at certain checkpoints—for instance the second Assinovsakaya checkpoint— extort them for bribes, threatening to send those who do not pay to the back of the line. Internally displaced persons seeking entry to other parts of the Russian Federation are also subjected to extortion and bribes by the border guards and border authorities. This only adds to the hardships suffered by those fleeing the conflict. Moreover, we are concerned at continuing obstructions for those wishing to leave either Ingushetia or Chechnya and seek refuge in other cities in the Russian Federation, where many of them have relatives who can assist. While restrictions preventing the movement of displaced Chechens to other parts of Russia have now apparently been lifted, travel remains difficult and many displaced persons are forced to pay large bribes in order to move on public transportation. Disturbing reports continue of ethnically motivated harassment by Moscow police of ethnic Chechens and people of other Caucasus nationalities, making Moscow a highly inhospitable environment for internally displaced persons. We urge you to impress on the Russian authorities the importance of keeping the border with Ingushetia open, and allowing free, safe, and unimpeded access for all displaced persons to move into Ingushetia. In particular, efforts should be taken to speed up and simplify border control procedures, and action should be taken to prevent and punish corruption and extortion at the border crossings. We also request that you stress the need for the Russian authorities to uphold the rights of internally displaced persons to freedom of movement and freedom to choose place of residence within the Russian Federation. In this regard we ask you to draw the attention of the Russian authorities to Principle 14 and 15 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which guarantee freedom of movement and freedom to choose place of residence for all internally displaced persons. Principle 15 (a) stipulates that states must guarantee the right of all internally displaced persons to """"seek safety in another part of the country."""" The current actions of the Russian authorities violate these Principles. Finally, we hope that you will urge Prime Minister Putin to prevail upon the Moscow city government to cease the harassment of ethnic minorities, including internally displace persons, in the capital. Relocations to Chechnya In a letter to Prime Minister Putin on October 5, Human Rights Watch raised serious concerns regarding the announced plans to relocate displaced persons to districts of Chechnya under the control of Russian federal troops. We stressed that such areas were potential places of military engagement, and that the security and protection of displaced persons could not be guaranteed. Moreover, international humanitarian agencies did not have access to these areas in order to assess conditions or provide assistance. At that time, we urged the Russian government to immediately cease all plans to relocate displaced persons to areas under its military control. We have since learned that at least 159 people have been resettled in northern Chechnya in Russian military controlled areas. We urge you to seek assurances from Prime Minister Putin that internally displaced persons will not be resettled in parts of Chechnya where their security and safety can not be guaranteed, and where there is no access for humanitarian agencies. In this regard, we refer to Principle 15 (d) of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which states that all internally displaced persons have """"the right to be protected against forcible return to or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/ or health would be at risk."""" Attacks on Internally Displaced Persons We were deeply shocked to learn about the aerial attack on a Red Cross convoy of displaced persons in Chechnya, after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the Ingush-Chechen border on October 31. The vehicles in the convoy were clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem. Such an attack is a clear violation of the Russian government's obligations under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to refrain from attacks on civilians. Principle 10 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement also expressly prohibits direct or indiscriminate attacks or other acts of violence against internally displaced persons. The lack of a clearly identified corridor from towns and villages under Russian fire has caused civilian casualties, particularly for those fleeing westalong the Baku-Rostov highway. We have received multiple reports of shell and artillery fire on civilians fleeing these areas in unmarked vehicles. We urge you to raise these serious incidents with Prime Minister Putin during your discussions and to seek assurances that internally displaced persons will be protected from direct or indiscriminate attacks, both while they are in camps or settlements, and when they are fleeing for safety. Access to Humanitarian Assistance As you know, conditions for the internally displaced are extremely harsh, and as winter approaches will only deteriorate further. We remain seriously concerned that, primarily due to the volatile security conditions, international humanitarian agencies do not have full, safe, and unimpeded access to all internally displaced persons. In particular, conditions for those displaced persons on the Chechen side of the Ingush-Chechen border have episodically been reported to be dire. We fear that should escalated attacks drive thousands more to flee to Ingushetia, the back-log could again cause long delays in crossing and could leave thousands of people stranded with no shelter and very limited access to humanitarian assistance and medical care. This underscores the need for unfettered and secure access to those who wait at the border. Conditions inside Ingushetia are not much better. Like you, we are extremely concerned about the plight of displaced persons living in freezing railway carriages and makeshift camps with very scant assistance and very limited access to medical care. The tens of thousands of people staying with host families are marginally better off, but there are serious concerns that the host families themselves may be unable to make it through the winter without additional assistance. Human Rights Watch welcomes UNHCR's efforts to bring relief convoys into Ingushetia. The needs of the people are however enormous and much more must be done to assist them. We urge you in your discussions with the Russian authorities to impress upon them the importance of accepting all offers of international assistance. The Russian authorities also have an obligation to ensure full, safe, and unimpeded access for all humanitarian organizations to the displaced, and to safeguard the security of humanitarian personnel. In this regard, we draw your attention to Principles 18 to 19, and 24 to 26 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which clearly stipulate the obligations of governments to provide adequate assistance to internally displaced persons, and to ensure full and safe access for international humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance as necessary. We are pleased to hear that you will be able to visit the Ingush-chechen border while you are in the Russian Federation and hope that you will get the opportunity to visit displaced persons on both sides of the border. We would also like to draw your attention to the desperate state of the Sunzha District hospital in Ordzhonokidzovskaya, near the border. Human Rights Watch has learned through frequent visits that this hospital is experiencing severe deficits of medicines and equipment. It is bearing the brunt of the influx of wounded civilians from Chechnya, as it is situated near the border and is close to camps for the displaced. Any assistance that UNHCR is able to provide to this hospital is desperately needed. Prioritizing Protection Finally, while the humanitarian needs of displaced persons are indisputable, their protection from physical attacks, intimidation, and harassment is equally vital. Recognizing the operational constraints facing international agencies, such as UNHCR, we nevertheless urge you to make protection for the internally displaced a top priority, not only in your discussions with the Russian authorities, but also in your operations on the ground. In particular, sufficient numbers of protection officers should be deployed to the region. As resident humanitarian coordinator in Moscow, UNHCR should actively assert its protection, as well as its humanitarian, mandate. In this regard, we draw your attention to Principle 27 (1) of the Guiding Principles, which states that """"International humanitarian organizations and other appropriate actors when providing assistance should give due regard to the protection needs and human rights of internally displaced persons and take appropriate measures in this regard."""" Once again, we would like to reiterate our appreciation and support for your visit to Russia, at the request of the Secretary General of the U.N. We hope that you will have the opportunity to raise our concerns with the Russian authorities during your discussions, and we look forward to working together to improve the conditions for those civilians worst affected by the conflict in Chechnya.

Human Rights Watch is urging the OSCE to press the Russian government for access to the conflict zone to monitor and alleviate conditions for civilians, and to simplify border procedures. It should also persuade the Russian government to agree to well-publicized temporary cease-fires to allow civilians to flee unharmed. Finally, it should ensure that any new OSCE assistance group to Chechnya have unfettered access to the conflict zone. Should the Russian government fail to demonstrate its commitment to OSCE standards, OSCE member states should be prepared to consider refusing to conclude the Security Charter at the summit. This charter will be one of the major points of negotiation among the 55 heads of state. Since Russia began bombing and shelling Chechnya in September, an estimated 300,000 people have fled their homes. Countless civilians have been killed or maimed. About 200,000 internally displaced persons crowd tiny Ingushetia, straining its already fledgling infrastructure. Cold temperatures put many of them in life-threatening situations. As the bombing and shelling drags on, tens of thousands of civilians are desperate to find their way to safety. Human Rights Watch researchers who interviewed the displaced in Ingushetia have found that persistent aerial or other missile attacks have prevented people from fleeing Chechnya, causing them to huddle in basements or venture to other villages that were not under attack. This has had disastrous consequences for civilians injured by the attacks but could not seek timely medical assistance. This suffering was compounded by the ten-day closure of the Chechen-Ingush border, the main exit route for civilians out of Chechnya. The new border procedures are cumbersome and still spell lengthy delays. Russian authorities have refused to allow international humanitarian assistance through the border to reach these people. Indeed, they have refused all access to Chechnya, creating an information blackout on the needs of civilians left behind. Just last week, Russian forces refused to allow an OSCE mission in the region access to Chechen side of the border.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Human Rights Watch pointed out that it would be negligent for Clinton to visit Bulgaria without addressing the country's long history of supplying weapons to human rights abusers. In a letter to Clinton made public today, Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. to take the lead in pressing Bulgaria to reform. """"We are hopeful that Bulgaria intends to change its practices,"""" wrote Joost Hiltermann, Executive Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch, """"but additional prodding may be needed to help Bulgaria overcome the legacy of decades of irresponsible weapons dealing."""" Ongoing problems with Bulgaria's arms trade include troubling arms deals approved by the government and others that take place via illicit channels, he said. According to Hiltermann, Bulgaria's current government has pledged to uphold rigorous international standards for arms trading, but since taking office in 1997 it has repeatedly flouted its commitments not to sell weapons to human rights abusers or areas of violent conflict. For example, Ugandan forces received tanks from Bulgaria earlier this year, despite serious concerns about where the tanks might be deployed. In addition, both sides in the Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict bought Bulgarian weapons to sustain a conflict that has displaced large numbers of civilians. In its bid to join NATO, Bulgaria is downsizing its armed forces and shedding surplus Soviet-era weapons in favor of NATO-standard equipment. Bulgaria's military modernization drive is expected to contribute to a cascade of cheap surplus weapons from eastern Europe into the hands of abusive military forces in Africa and elsewhere. Bulgarian authorities are currently drafting new arms trade legislation and are expected to present a draft law to parliament during Clinton's visit. Human Rights Watch asks that Clinton encourage Bulgarian authorities to make important changes to the existing law governing authorized arms transfers. The international monitoring organization added that legal changes alone would be insufficient to reign in the country's arms dealing and called on Clinton to highlight the need for strict implementation and enforcement of Bulgaria's arms trade controls.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Bulgaria","Arms"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/11/11/letter-president-clinton","Letter to President Clinton","Letter to President Clinton","Bulgaria's Troubling Arms Trade Record","11/11/1999","William Jefferson Clinton   President of the United States   The White House     RE: Bulgarian arms trade     Dear President Clinton:     In light of your upcoming official visit to Bulgaria, we would like to draw your attention to Bulgaria's troubling arms trade record and the need to encourage substantive reforms.    In recent years, Bulgaria been implicated repeatedly in arms transfers to abusive government and rebel forces, both through illicit channels and via government-authorized deals. Human Rights Watch field investigations in Angola and Burundi, among other places, have shown that Bulgaria has been an important weapons source for abusive forces. Drawing on these cases, and eager to help stem the flow of weapons to human rights abusers, we recently conducted extensive research on Bulgaria's arms trade policy and practices. The attached backgrounder summarizes and updates our April 1999 findings.     Human Rights Watch is encouraged that Bulgaria's current reform-minded government has pledged to uphold internationally recognized standards for arms trading. Bulgaria's international commitments include having joined the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on transparency and restraint in the weapons trade, and agreeing to follow the European Union Code of Conduct in Arms Exports which sets rigorous standards specifically regarding human rights. Unfortunately, since committing to follow these standards, Bulgaria has contravened the E.U. Code and violated the spirit of the WA by approving arms transfers to areas of violent conflict and to human rights abusers. For example, Bulgaria has played a role in arms supplies to both sides of the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea-a conflict that has lead to large numbers of displaced people. As you know, the U.S. government has declared a moratorium on arms sales to areas of conflict and has encouraged others to follow suit.     We have been in contact with the government of Bulgaria and have been encouraged to learn that officials are currently drafting a new arms trade law that is expected for release in late November. An improved law is urgently needed as the current one does not incorporate Bulgaria's international commitments to refrain from selling arms to human rights abusers. In addition, Bulgarian authorities must continue to focus on enhancing enforcement of arms trade controls if illicit and so-called gray market arms deals are to stop..Our concerns are heightened by the planned army reform that has been launched in preparation for joining NATO. Bulgaria has announced that it plans to cut its armed forces by half and dispose of vast quantities of equipment. For example, the number of tanks in Bulgaria's arsenal is scheduled to be reduced from 1,475 to 750 by 2004. While a tank that has been destroyed and converted to scrap metal only draws in a revenue of U.S. $2,000, the same tank currently sells for U.S. $30,000 on the open market. Understandably, the incentive to sell such surplus is very strong, but these lower quality weapons often go to impoverished countries in Africa's conflict regions where human rights abuses abound.     We are hopeful that Bulgaria intends to change its practices, but more prodding may be needed to help Bulgaria overcome the legacy of decades of irresponsible weapons dealing. We urge you to raise these concerns with the Bulgarian government.     Specifically, we are calling on the Bulgarian government to:     * incorporate human rights and humanitarian concerns into national arms trade policy;   * strengthen the regulatory system that so far has allowed shady arms deals to receive authorization and bypass controls;   * enhance accountability for violations of arms trade laws;   * improve transparency and thereby strengthen oversight; and   * dispose responsibly of surplus weapons     Thank you very much for your consideration.     Sincerely,     Joost R.

Despite nearly universal ratification of the Convention, millions of children receive no education, work long hours under hazardous conditions, or languish in inhumane conditions in institutions. Others endure harassment and physical abuse by police, are subject to trafficking and sexual exploitation, or are forced to become soldiers or refugees from armed conflict. """"The international community has failed its children,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director for the Children's Rights Division of Human Right Watch. """"For too many children, the promises of the Convention remain hollow, and the abuses they endure every day contradict the commitments made by their governments."""" Every recognized country of the world, except the United States and the collapsed state of Somalia, has ratified the Convention, making it the single most widely ratified treaty in existence. The Convention was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989, and is the focus of a special U.N. General Assembly session on November 11. """"The U.S. failure to ratify this convention is inexcusable,"""" said Whitman. """"What kind of message does this send? It undermines the U.S.'s credibility as a nation that cares about children."""" The Human Rights Watch report, """"Promises Broken,"""" assesses the rights of children, drawing on research conducted in twenty-six countries over the past five years. The report surveys a broad range of children's rights, including:  Child Soldiers: 300,000 children in more than thirty countries are participating in armed conflicts, serving on the front lines of combat, as spies, messengers, porters and human mine detectors, and subject to injury, disability, psychological trauma and death. Refugees: Children make up over half of the world's refugees. They are also subject to hazardous labor exploitation, physical abuse, denial of education, sexual violence and exploitation, cross-border attacks and recruitment as child soldiers.  Police Abuse and Arbitrary Detention of Street Children: Street children throughout the world are subjected to routine harassment and physical abuse by police, government and private security forces, who seek to clean the streets of a perceived social blight. Street children face extortion, theft, severe beatings, mutilation, sexual abuse and even death.  Children in Conflict with the Law: Children are often denied due process, are physically abused or tortured while in state custody, and subjected to appalling conditions of confinement. Six countries, including the United States, are known to have executed juvenile offenders during the past decade.  Orphans and Abandoned Children: Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of children are kept in orphanages and non-penal institutions, after being orphaned or abandoned. In some cases, such children are deprived of adequate food and basic medical care, an adequate education, and subjected to appalling levels of cruelty and sometimes deadly neglect.  Child Labor: 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 work in developing countries. Nearly half work full-time and have little or no access to education. Child laborers may be chained to carpet looms, work in the field sixteen hours a day, or be hidden away as domestic servants, earning little and often physically abused.  Sexual Abuse and Trafficking: An unknown but very large number of children are used for commercial sexual purposes every year, often ending up victims of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Prostituted children can be raped, beaten, sodomized, emotionally abused, tortured, and even killed by pimps.  Education: 130 million children in 1998 had no access to basic education, and millions of others received little or substandard instruction. In many countries, ethnic minorities and girls are denied an adequate education, and in poor or rural areas, prohibitive school fees may keep many children out of school. Human Rights Watch challenged governments to improve the lives of children by fully implementing the Convention. It also urged steps to strengthen protections for children including the ratification of the new International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and raising the minimum age for recruitment and participation in armed conflict from fifteen to eighteen.","Global","Children's Rights, Education, Youth Justice, Child Labor, Migrant and Refugee Children, Children Separated from Families, Children and Armed Conflict"

During Cedrás' three-year dictatorship, thousands were killed, tortured and raped. Generals Cedrás and Biamby were recently indicted by a Haitian judge for their participation in an April 1994 massacre in the slum of Raboteau, in which army forces killed approximately 20 people.

""""Panama's new leadership has the duty to either extradite Cedrás to Haiti or prosecute him in Panama."""" Vivanco noted that the Torture Convention forms the legal basis of Great Britain's arrest of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet.

""""This is a significant gesture by a government whose human rights record has been under increasing scrutiny, both domestically and internationally,"""" said Hanny Megally, director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"However, we are still far from fulfilling the government's long-standing claim that there are no political prisoners in Tunisia; hundreds more remain imprisoned.""""  Most of those freed appear to be sympathizers or low-ranking adherents of Tunisia's banned Islamist movement, imprisoned for such offenses as attending meetings of an """"unauthorized"""" organization or making donations to the families of imprisoned members. No high-ranking members of the movement are known to have been released.  In addition, several accused members of the banned leftist Tunisian Communist Workers Party (PCOT) have been released, including five who were sentenced on political charges after an unjust trial in July that was observed by Human Rights Watch and other rights groups. They include Ali Jellouli, Nejib Baccouchi, Noureddine Benticha, Chadli Hammami, and Taha Sassi. The five had spent more than nineteen months in prison; at least two of their codefendants, Fahem Boukaddous and Bourhan Gasmi, reportedly remain behind bars.  Human Rights Watch urged Tunisian authorities to ensure that released political prisoners enjoy their civil and political rights. In general, ex-political prisoners in Tunisia are subjected to long-term restrictions and harassment, some of it court-sanctioned and some arbitrary. They are required to present themselves frequently—often once daily— at a local police station. They and their relatives face frequent police searches and questioning, and are usually prevented from obtaining a passport and often employment. In addition, all whose releases are """"conditional"""" could be returned to prison upon the decision of the Ministry of Interior. In an encouraging development, a large but undetermined number of previously released prisoners who had until now been subjected to such abusive practices have, since November 6, been informed by the police that they will no longer be required to report regularly to the police. Some, however, were reportedly warned at the same time to refrain from political activity. The release of political prisoners is part of a reported amnesty of more than 1,000 inmates, including hundreds serving time for common crimes. It occurs one week ahead of Tunisia's scheduled meeting with the European Union's Council of Ministers in Brussels, within the framework of the E.U.-Tunisian Association Agreement. That accord stipulates in Article 2 that human rights and democratic principles """"constitute an essential element of the agreement."""" (Human Rights Watch, together with Amnesty International, the International Federation of Human Rights, and Reporters sans Frontières, wrote an open letter November 5 to the E.U. Council of Ministers urging that human rights be a priority at the November 16 meeting.)  The releases do not yet appear to have been accompanied by other measures to address Tunisia's grave human rights problems, including the harassment of human rights and independent political activists. On November 9, Political and Human Rights Activist Mostapha Ben Jaafar was scheduled to appear before an investigating judge to answer to four charges stemming from two communiqués critical of the October 24 elections that Ben Jaafar issued in the name of the Democratic Forum. The Forum is a political association that has been refused legal recognition since Ben Jaafar co-founded it in 1994. Ben Jaafar faces charges of maintaining an """"unrecognized"""" association, insulting """"the public order,"""" """"spreading false information aiming to disturb the public order,"""" and """"distributing leaflets likely to disturb the public order."""" The hearing was postponed, at the request of the defense, until November 16. Yesterday, Moncef Marzouki appeared before an investigative judge to face the same charges as Ben Jaafar, as well as a fifth charge: defamation of the judiciary. The hearing was postponed until November 17. Marzouki, a veteran human rights activist, is spokesperson of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), an independent human rights monitoring organization founded one year ago that has continued to criticize abuses in Tunisia despite the government's rejection of its application for legal recognition. The charges relate to communiqués issued by the CNLT, including a recent one regarding a strike by prisoners that referred to the lack of judicial independence in Tunisia. """"As some Tunisians are being freed from prison,"""" Megally observed, """"others like Ben Jaafar and Marzouki are facing prosecution and possibly jail for exercising their right to criticize rights violations and urge more democracy.

Since 1992, 40 states have adopted such legislation, driven by inaccurate assumptions that juvenile crime is on the rise and that trying children as adults will reduce crime. Neither premise is correct. Juvenile crime has declined steadily since 1993, and several studies have concluded that juveniles tried as adults are more likely to commit crimes in the future than youth prosecuted in juvenile courts. While trying children as adults neither reduces crime nor rehabilitates the children, it often leads to abuses. Adult jails lack the infrastructure, staffing and programs to handle youth. Locking up these children in adult jails is a violation of their basic human rights. During a 12-month period, Human Rights Watch visited five jails in Maryland and interviewed more than 60 juvenile detainees. We found staff not trained to handle juveniles, children not getting enough education or recreation, and jails that lack appropriate medical and mental health care. The children we spoke with complained that they were not getting enough to eat. Children held in the Baltimore City Detention Center endure particularly appalling conditions and face daily threats to their physical safety. They are confined to grim, poorly lit cells crawling with cockroaches and rodents. Violence is rampant. Frequent fights lead to lengthy """"lock downs,"""" during which entire sections are restricted to their cells, sometimes for weeks at a time. Children held in adult jails are as much as eight times more likely to commit suicide than those held in juvenile detention centers. Yet the Baltimore jail offers almost no counseling to juvenile detainees, either in groups or individually. Detainees in crisis may be placed under suicide watch, but they then are kept naked, with nothing but paper sheets to cover their bodies. Although the best preparation for reentering society may be access to education, some of the Maryland jails we visited offer no education to youth; others provided schooling that fell far short of the number of hours required by state law. Clearly, the state is failing its children. While some children, particularly those accused of committing violent offenses, may need to be detained in juvenile institutions pending trial, they do not belong in jail with adult inmates. This kind of treatment violates international law and the Constitution. Maryland can and must do better.","United States","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Shelling continued on Sunday and Monday, he reported. Six airplanes were involved in the attack around midday on Sunday. The aircraft began bombing the northern part of the city, and then shifted to the city center where the truck was hit.

Witness accounts contradict recent claims by Russian officials that civilians are not suffering unduly. On Friday, Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of Russia's general staff, said, """"Attempts to convince the world that...we are using disproportionate force, that the refugees are in a horrible situation— this is not at all true...""""

Russian aircraft also continued to bomb Urus-Martan, a town fifteen miles south of Grozny, over the weekend. A fifty-two year-old engineer, also named Vakha, reported that water is so scarce in Grozny that people are melting the season's first snow for consumption. He fled the capital only this morning, repeating claims made by numerous witnesses that civilians are crouching in basements for hours during bombing runs, with little to eat and only firewood for heat.

During visits to the Chechen border, Human Rights Watch researchers have also learned that people driving vehicles must wait up to three days to leave the war-torn republic. Russian authorities have recently established a more rapid screening procedure permitting Chechens to leave, reducing significantly the estimated 40,000-person backlog of last week. However, approximately two thousand people still line the highway out of Chechnya waiting to pass multiple checkpoints spread over four miles.

The 196-page report, """"Confessions At Any Cost: Police Torture in Russia,"""" is based on a two-year study, including more than fifty interviews with torture victims in five regions across Russia. Dozens of lawyers, former police officers, judges, and others were also interviewed for the report. """"Torture is epidemic in Russia today,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"It doesn't matter whether the crime committed by the detainee is serious or not—in fact, it doesn't even matter whether the detainee actually committed the crime or not. All kinds of people may fall victim to this terrible human rights abuse."""" Some Russian experts estimate that 50 percent of police detainees are subject to torture or ill-treatment. The most common form of torture involves prolonged beatings, with punches, kicks, and blows from a nightstick commonly aimed at the victim's head, back, kidneys, legs, and heels. Other forms of torture have nicknames among police. The """"slonik,"""" or """"elephant,"""" refers to the practice of asphyxiating a victim by putting a gas mask over his face and turning off the oxygen supply (the hose is thought to resemble an elephant's trunk). In the """"lastochka,"""" or """"swallow,"""" the victim's hands are handcuffed behind his back and hung from an iron bar with his feet off the ground, while he is beaten with a nightstick. In the """"konvertik,"""" or """"envelope,"""" the detainee is forced to sit for extended periods with his head between his knees and his hands tied to his feet, while being beaten. The police also use electric shock. Former detainees describe a """"cranking machine"""" similar to a field telephone, which sends an excruciating current via electrodes inserted in the prisoners' ears. Two people interviewed by Human Rights Watch jumped out the window of the police station and were seriously injured rather than be subjected to further electric shock. Detainees are often sent to the """"press-khata,"""" or """"press hut,"""" where cellmates who receive privileges from the police are encouraged to beat or sometimes rape detainees to induce them to confess. Police torture detainees suspected of minor crimes. Oleg Fetisov, a fifteen-year-old boy in Ekaterinburg, was beaten and nearly asphyxiated in 1996 for stealing a jacket from another schoolboy. Human Rights Watch also documents several cases in which victims died from torture. Most torture victims are unable to get immediate access to medical professionals, let alone the official forensic medical experts without whose testimony torture is difficult to prove in a Russian court. As a result, medical evidence of torture is almost always lost. Complaints about torture filed during a defendant's trial are usually dismissed without serious consideration. The procuracy, which is the state agency responsible for criminal investigation, is also responsible for protecting human rights—a clear conflict of interest in cases of torture. Human Rights Watch is aware of the conviction of 25 police officers for torture or ill-treatment in seven criminal cases, over the course of six years. """"Nearly all cases of torture are going unpunished,"""" said Roth. """"The Russian government will not even acknowledge that the problem exists."""" Roth urged the Russian government to establish a commission consisting of representatives of law enforcement agencies, human rights organizations, the government ombudsman on torture, and other experts, and to task this commission with drawing up a plan to combat torture. Roth also called on the Russian government to institute a prompt judicial review of all detentions, so that judges can assess the lawfulness of the detention and the treatment received by the detainee. He also called on the government to reform the procuracy to ensure that policing and judicial tasks are performed by separate and independent bodies. Roth urged Western government to take special care that no aid money be dispensed to units of security forces that are responsible for gross human rights abuse.

Rosemary Nelson, killed in a car bomb attack in March 1999, was the second human rights lawyer murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland; the first was Patrick Finucane in 1989. The failure to carry out an independent inquiry into Patrick Finucane's death, and to find anyone responsible for his death, contributed to a deterioration in the rule of law, whereby police officers routinely made derogatory and threatening remarks about lawyers with impunity. Rosemary Nelson also alleged police intimidation and her murder further undermined the rule of law. Her killing was an indictment of the U.K. government's and the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) failure to protect her life. """"A criminal investigation cannot adequately address the failure of government and the police to heed repeated warnings that Rosemary's Nelson's life was under threat,"""" said Julia Hall, counsel in the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Moreover, the RUC's continuing involvement in the Nelson murder investigation undermines confidence that her complaints regarding police intimidation will ever be thoroughly and impartially investigated."""" The organizations urged the U.K. authorities to meet their obligations under international standards to carry out an independent, thorough and impartial inquiry into the Nelson murder including investigations of: Rosemary Nelson's complaints to the Independent Commission on Police Complaints regarding persistent RUC harassment and intimidation;  Alleged RUC harassment and intimidation of other lawyers through their clients in special interrogation centres; Death threats Rosemary Nelson received in the context of other death threats targeting nationalists issued by loyalist paramilitaries at the same time; ; The RUC's failure to carry out an impartial investigation into her allegations of police abuse;  The RUC's failure to investigate other lawyers' allegations of police intimidation and abuse; The RUC's failure to take Rosemary Nelson's fears seriously, to take numerous human rights organizations' complaints regarding threats to her life seriously and ultimately to protect her life;  The Northern Ireland Office's failure to ensure protection of Rosemary Nelson's life despite repeated warnings and pleas by international organizations such as the United Nations and many human rights groups; and  The Northern Ireland Office's failure to comply with most of the U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 1998 recommendations concerning the intimidation of lawyers.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/11/09/china-uses-rule-law-justify-falun-gong-crackdown","China Uses Rule of Law to Justify Falun Gong Crackdown","China Uses """"Rule of Law"""" to Justify Falun Gong Crackdown","","11/09/1999","(New York) -- As the Chinese government continued its nationwide roundup of Falun Gong members, Human Rights Watch said that China's intensified campaign against the exercise and meditation group clearly violated United Nations human rights standards. Chinese officials have formally arrested more than one hundred individuals and are preparing to put them on trial. The international monitoring group called on the international community to step up pressure on Beijing for an end to the crackdown, and also urged Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, to again intervene with the highest level officials in Beijing. """"Cloaking this campaign in rhetoric about the ‘rule of law' doesn't give any greater legitimacy to China's crackdown on Falun Gong,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The official ban on Falun Gong should be lifted. The government's announcement that it was a ‘true cult' and must be suppressed should be rescinded. All Falun Gong members in detention, formally charged, or sentenced to labor camps for peaceful activities should be immediately released,"""" he added. The Chinese leadership's attempt to contain Falun Gong is part of a broader government effort to try to control all organizations, religious, civil, social or economic. The number of members, their ability to organize, and their use of modern tools of communication have made the Falun Gong especially threatening. Concerns about social instability, fed by large-scale unemployment, a stagnant rural economy, and the demoralizing effects of pervasive unemployment, add to the leadership's need to ensure that the Chinese people's first loyalties remain with the Chinese Communist Party. On November 8, 1999, China's State Council confirmed the formal arrest of at least 111 members on charges of gathering illegally to disturb social order, stealing state secrets, and other charges. Many others not formally arrested have been administratively sentenced without trial to """"reeducation through labor"""" camps by the police for up to three years, or are undergoing anti-Falun Gong education, though actual numbers can't be confirmed. The government insists they are not compiling figures nationwide. The authorities, in carrying out the crackdown, seem to be carefully distinguishing between organizers and ordinary Falun Gong followers. In a November 5 circular, the People's Supreme Court admonished the courts to make a sharp distinction between """"criminal elements"""" and cult leaders who should be treated harshly, and common Falun Gong practitioners who should be extricated from cults, educated, then reintegrated into the social fabric. Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the Beijing police's use of regulations controlling lodging in the city by people from the provinces, to prevent Falun Gong members from assembling. The police newspaper, Shoudu Gongan Bao, or Capital Public Security News, reported on November 5 that since October more than 800 Falun Gong members who came to Beijing were picked up in hotel sweeps and detained. Seventeen landlords and hoteliers who """"illegally rented out rooms"""" to Falun Gong members were punished with fines or forced out of business. This policy targeting landlords and small and mid-sized hotels seemed aimed at preventing the group's members from exercising their rights of free association and the right to liberty of movement -- rights expressly protected in a U.N. treaty China has signed. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by China in October 1998 but not yet ratified, guarantees freedom of belief, expression, association and assembly. It also guarantees fair and open trials before an impartial tribunal, and protection against arbitrary detention. Roundups of Falun Gong members in Qingdao, Shandong province and Yinchuan City, Ningxia Autonomous Region, were recently reported in the official Chinese Legal Daily (November 5 and 6, 1999). It said those arrested are being accused of """"organizing illegal gatherings,"""" """"spreading anti-government propaganda and illegal publications and books,"""" and carrying out """"illegal link-up activities."""" Similar activities and arrests also reportedly took place in Urumqi in Xinjiang province, Jinan in Shandong province, and Changchun in Liaoning province. All of these activities are clearly protected under international law. The crackdown on Falun Gong began with the Ministry of Public Security's announcement on July 22, 1999 declaring Falun Gong an unlawful organization. It banned advertising Falun Gong, distributing its materials, gathering to exercise and meditate, and petitioning to protect Falun Gong. Two additional articles banned disturbing the social order through factual distortion and fabrication or spreading rumors; and prohibited any organized protest against government decisions. They were vague in describing which violations constituted crimes and which might result in administrative punishment. On October 9, the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate (prosecutor's office), issued a series of interpretations that encourages authorities to apply existing laws harshly to Falun Gong members. In particular, these authorities pressed for the punishment of """"heretical sects"""" under a section of the criminal law that prescribes stiff penalties for the most serious crimes, penalties that include life imprisonment or execution. They stated explicitly the kind of cult activities that are punishable under provisions in Article 300 of the Criminal Law--the only article that refers specifically to cults. The article gives possible sentences for those who organize or use superstitious sects, secret societies and evil religious organizations. The Court added """"those who set up and make use of cult organizations"""" to other articles dealing with intentional murder or injury, sexual exploitation and rape, fraud, splitting the country, or overthrowing the socialist system. The """"interpretations"""" also laid out the characteristics of a cult organization. Article 300 mandates a minimum sentence of seven years for """"especially serious"""" or otherwise grave acts. In all other categories, penalties run as high as life imprisonment or death. On October 27, Xinhua, the official news agency, using the definition in the October 9 interpretations, published evidence """"proving"""" that Falun Gong was indeed a """"true cult."""" It cited the group's tight hierarchial structure, the doomsday theory promulgated by its leader, the systematic mind control it said Falun Gong members were subject to, and the physical and psychological suffering it claimed was induced in many followers. With these preliminary steps in place , the Chinese leadership is now claiming its crackdown is occurring under the rule of law. On October 30, 1999 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) banned all heretical cults, set out preventative measures, and mandated punishment. This decision had the effect of extending existing laws. The NPC called for a severe crackdown on the criminal activities of cult leaders, while educating and seeking to reintegrate the bulk of believers. It urged an all-out effort to disclose the """"inhumane and anti-social nature of heretical cults."""" """"China's major trading partners should increase pressure on Beijing to halt the crackdown on Falun Gong. It makes little sense to bring China into the World Trade Organization and expect it to abide by global trading rules when Beijing flaunts international rules of human rights with total impunity,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.","Asia, China and Tibet","Free Speech"

Five displaced Chechens from Urus-Martan, a town located fifteen miles south of Grozny, said that Russian warplanes and missiles had been striking the town since early October. Human Rights Watch previously reported twenty-seven Urus-Martan deaths on October 3, following an attack by ten Russian warplanes. Since then, according to forty-six-year-old Apti Zakayev, Russian warplanes and missiles have hit portions of the town every day at approximately 3:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 1:00 p.m. Zura, a fifty-year-old woman interviewed as she crossed the Chechen-Ingush border, said the town was shelled as recently as last Wednesday morning. On Tuesday (Nov 2), she said, Russian air-to-surface missiles killed three persons, including two young women and an elderly man. Witnesses report that Chechen fighters are deployed in the eastern portions of Urus-Martan, but say the Russian fire is hitting both civilian and rebel areas. On the evening of October 19, forty-year-old Leyla Zakayeva took advantage of a lull in the shelling to check on the fate of relatives. Several streets were particularly hard hit, including Aslambek Sharipov Street, Pervomayskaya, Bolnichnaya, Chernyekhova, Dostoevskogo, and Trudovaya streets. The six streets are part of a residential neighborhood, located some three kilometers to the southeast of the town center. """"Some of the streets had huge craters where shells and missiles had hit,"""" recalled forty-six-year-old Apti Zakayev. Leyla said that dead bodies were lying along the streets, and that her family members were """"searching for body fragments in the trees and on nearby rooftops."""" Another witness said that Lenin and Titov streets, both located in the center of town, were """"totally destroyed."""" At 11:00 p.m. a shell hit near Leyla Zakayeva's house on Aslambek Sharipov Street. Zakayeva and her children hastened to take shelter in the basement, but a direct hit killed her husband, fifty-year-old Ibrahim Umalatov, only yards away from the shelter. Zakayeva was wounded by shrapnel in her left buttock and upper left thigh while two neighboring homes, owned by Saidalim Umalatov and his brother, were also destroyed in the blast. Saidalim's left arm was torn off by the impact. One thirty-five-year-old woman from Urus-Martan said Thursday that there were Chechen fighters in different areas of the town, including rebel posts in the poultry farm and in what used to be a children's dormitory. Last week, Human Rights Watch cited a witness reporting the presence of hundreds of rebel fighters in a compound on the eastern edge of the town in early October. Although some of the Russian fire has been focused on the eastern side, civilians were being hit throughout the town. According to three witnesses, Russian shells began striking Novyi Sharoi on October 23, killing at least nine persons and wounding another ten. In peacetime, some 300 people live in this tiny hamlet, located 18 miles east of Grozny; that figure had swelled by late October by several hundred. The witnesses said there had been no Chechen fighters in Novyi Sharoi since the beginning of hostilities, and that people from the surrounding areas had therefore sought refuge there. """"No one thought that Novyi Sharoi would be shelled, because we have never had fighters here,"""" said thirty-six-year-old Zalman Achiyeva. On October 23, however, Russian shells struck Novyi Sharoi, hitting homes throughout the village. The Isayev residence suffered a direct hit, killing four--including both adult Isayevs and their two teenage daughters. Zalman Achiyeva's thirty-six-year-old husband, Vakhid, was badly wounded while standing in front of the village mosque. He lost both feet and his right eye, and suffered multiple fractures to the right shin. The Achiyevs waited in a basement in Novyi Sharoi until October 29, when a lull in the shelling allowed them to flee toward the Ingush border. Both Achiyevs were interviewed last week in the Ingushetia Republic Hospital. Twenty-eight-year-old Satsita Abdullayeva told Human Rights Watch that she had fled to Novyi Sharoi from Samashki village on October 28, along with dozens of other Samashki residents. Novyi Sharoi was heavily shelled that day, killing a ten-year-old girl and a woman. Abdullayeva said that the victims were killed when their shelter, an underground grain storage facility, suffered five direct hits. A third man, twenty-year-old Rustam, was killed hours later when a shell hit the hamlet's mosque. """"Many refugees from Samashki and other places are hiding in the basements,"""" Abdullayeva said. """"And they are afraid to risk leaving their shelters."""" Abdullayeva was hit by shrapnel in her back and leg during an earlier attack on Samashki.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

The Appeals Court of the ICTR freed Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza because the prosecutor's office had failed to inform him of charges against him, had not insisted on his prompt transfer from a jail in Cameroon, and had not presented him before the ICTR within the specified time period. The Appeals Court ordered Barayagwiza returned to Cameroon where he had spent nineteen months in detention. """"This decision should jolt the prosecutor's office and the international community in general, reminding everyone of the need for prompt and exemplary justice. When the ICTR was set up, international actors contributed great rhetoric but little money,"""" stated Alison Des Forges, the Rwandan specialist at Human Rights Watch. """"The early bumblings and delays of the poorly funded prosecutor's office have led to a decision that distresses but should not surprise us."""" In May 1994 Human Rights Watch initiated the first judicial proceeding related to the genocide which ultimately killed at least a half a million persons. While the killing campaign was still underway, Human Rights Watch brought a suit against Barayagwiza, who was then in New York to plead the cause of the genocidal government before the U.N. Security Council. In an April 1996 decision of the case, Judge John Martin of the U.S. District Court, Southern District found that Barayagwiza """"engaged in conduct so inhuman that it is difficult to conceive of any civil remedy which can begin to compensate the plaintiffs for their loss or adequately express society's outrage at the defendant's actions."""" Martin awarded them $105 million in damages and declared, """"This Judge has seen no other case in which monetary damages were so inadequate to compensate the plaintiffs for the injuries caused by a defendant."""" Barayagwiza, then director of political affairs at the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, a political party known for its virulence against Tutsi. He also helped found Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), which incited to genocide and which broadcast specific directives on how to find and kill Tutsi once the genocide was launched. The release by the Appeals Court on procedural grounds closes the case against him in the ICTR. Barayagwiza remains subject to prosecution by national courts, such as those of Cameroon, where he was first arrested, or of Rwanda. The Appeals Court directed that he be returned to Cameroon but cannot order his prosecution there. Cameroon could extradite Barayagwiza for trial in Rwanda where he would face the death penalty if convicted. Rwandan courts are overwhelmed with a backlog of more than 125,000 cases of genocide suspects, some of whom have spent five years in detention without trial. """"The guilty must be tried and punished in order to break the impunity that has spurred violence in central Africa,"""" Des Forges continued.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/11/07/letter-mubarak","Letter to Mubarak","Letter to Mubarak","","11/07/1999","In a letter to President Hosni Mubarak made, Human Rights Watch protested the October 31 decision to prosecute twenty prominent civilians in Egypt's military justice system. The members of the Muslim Brotherhood, one of Egypt's largest political opposition forces, were arrested.  On November 1, 1999, the official MENA news agency announced the Egyptian government's resort to the military judiciary with the following English text: """"A group of twenty activists of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, arrested in a crackdown twenty days ago, will be referred to the military court in implementation of a Republican decree released [on October 31]. The Higher State Security Prosecution will hand the file of the defendants' case to the court within days."""" According to the independent, Cairo-based Arab Center for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP), this is the thirty-third case in which Egyptian civilians have been referred to military courts since 1992, with the total number of defendants in these cases now totaling 956. As a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Egypt must ensure that persons charged with criminal offenses have the right to fair trials. Article 14 of the ICCPR stipulates that international standards in this regard include the right to """"a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law,"""" and the right to review of any conviction and sentence by a higher tribunal. Trials of civilians in military courts violate these rights on two counts. First, the courts' judgments are final and cannot be appealed to a higher court or tribunal. Second, military courts do not afford civilians full due-process rights before an independent tribunal: the military is part of the executive branch of government and its justice system lacks the greater independence of the civilian judiciary. Human Rights Watch thus strongly urges Your Excellency to discontinue the practice of referring civilians to military courts. In the case of the twenty accused members of the Muslim Brotherhood, we also must reiterate our view that these men should not be prosecuted in the first place for """"spreading the group's ideas"""" and """"attempting to infiltrate the country's professional associations and controlling them,"""" among other accusations. As we wrote to Your Excellency last month, the group of defendants includes prominent lawyers, doctors, engineers, and university professors, many of whom are activists and serve as elected officers of professional associations or members of these associations' councils. They should be free to participate peacefully in Egypt's political and civic life, and not threatened with imprisonment for the exercise of their right to freedom of association and expression. All political parties and groupings in Egypt should have the right to peaceful freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to impart information and ideas of all kinds, including the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. Similarly, no one should face criminal prosecution for planning to compete peacefully in elections of professional associations on behalf of their political party or political grouping. Human Rights Watch again appeals to Your Excellency to lift the forty-five-year-old ban on the Muslim Brotherhood and permit its members to participate peacefully in all aspects of Egyptian political life without fear of arrest and prosecution. Thank you for your attention to these important matters, and we look forward to a reply at your earliest convenience.

Dr. Flora Brovina, 50,  was arrested by Serbian police in civilian clothes in front of her Pristina apartment on April 20, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. She is charged with committing terrorist acts against the Yugoslav State, according to Article 136 of the Yugoslav criminal code. The courts in Serbia are often controlled by the government. Defendants, especially Kosovar Albanians in political cases, are often denied due process. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Dr. Brovina will not be granted a fair trial. A pediatrician and poet, Dr. Brovina was the founder and head of the League of Albanian Women. She is charged with providing food, clothing, and medical supplies to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), as well as planning terrorist acts. During the war, her clinic provided medical services to women and children still in Pristina. Dr. Brovina was originally held in Kosovo's Lipljan prison, where other prisoners have told Human Rights Watch about regular beatings and maltreatment by prison guards, including a cordon of baton-wielding police that met all new detainees. On June 10, two days before the entry of NATO into Kosovo, she and hundreds of other prisoners were transferred to prisons inside Serbia. Dr. Brovina is being held in Pozarevac prison, where she has been visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), her lawyers, and her husband. However, her husband has not been able to meet with her alone and has had to speak Serbian, which can be monitored, rather than their native Albanian. Conditions in Pozarevac prison are better than in Kosovo, but Dr. Brovina has had difficulty obtaining medicine for her weak heart, her husband, Ajri Begu, told Human Rights Watch. Dr. Brovina's trial will be held in the Nis municipal court on November 11. Human Rights Watch called on diplomats in Yugoslavia and representatives of the international community, as well as journalists, to monitor the trial. """"It was a great mistake that the fate of Kosovar Albanian prisoners was not a part of the agreement between NATO and Yugoslavia that ended the war,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Now, at least, the international community should monitor the trials to make sure that they meet international standards."""" The Yugoslav government has acknowledged that approximately 1,900 Kosovar Albanians are being held in thirteen different detention facilities in Serbia. All of them have been visited at least once by the ICRC. But some known detainees do not appear on the government's list, such as Albin Kurti, the well-known student activist and former KLA political representative, who is currently in Pozarevac prison. Kosovo-based human rights groups claim that more than 5,000 Kosovar Albanians are currently missing, in addition to those in detention. It is not known whether these additional 5,000 people are in detention or dead.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

On October 25, Mounif Hammoud and Zaki Hassan Awada were expelled immediately upon their release from Khiam prison, according to reports from the Lebanese press and international news agencies. Mr. Awada is reportedly sixty-six years old. On July 1, 1999, two other elderly Lebanese were expelled from south Lebanon: Hassan Mohammed Said, seventy-two, and Khalil Deeb Saab, sixty-five. On October 26, a family of four from the village of Debbin was expelled at the Kfar Tebnit crossing point. Lebanese newspapers and international news agencies identified them as Jamil Wansa, his wife, Majida, forty-two, and their children, Mansur, sixteen, and Bushra, nine. The press, citing Lebanese security sources, said that the family was expelled because they refused to permit their son to join the SLA. The reported circumstances surrounding this family's expulsion is consistent with other cases that Human Rights Watch documented in Lebanon earlier this year. Earlier this year we obtained testimonial evidence about the practice of forced conscription into the SLA and expulsions of families from their homes and villages because male relatives, including children, either deserted the militia or fled the occupied zone in advance of conscription. In a report published in July 1999, we noted that the practice of forcing male residents of the zone to serve in the SLA is a violation of international humanitarian law. Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states in pertinent part: """"The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or progaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted."""" We called on Israel to investigate the forced conscription of Lebanese adults and children by the SLA, and to bring the practice to an immediate halt. Human Rights Watch also made recommendations in this report aimed at bringing Israeli and SLA practices in occupied Lebanon into full compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. We called on the government of Israel to issue clear directives to all Israeli military and intelligence forces operating in south Lebanon -- as well as to the SLA auxiliary militia -- to refrain immediately from taking any action that directly or indirectly effected, authorized, or facilitated the expulsions of civilian residents from the occupied zone. We also recommended that the government announce publicly that the practice of expulsions would cease, and that expelled families and individuals could return and recover their property under safe conditions, free of any form of corercion or intimidation from occupation security authorities. Given the legal gravity of expulsions as a matter of international humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch again appeals to your government to act on these recommendations with dispatch. Human Rights Watch was disappointed that Israeli government representatives were not available to meet with our representatives who visited Israel in July to release the expulsions report, and that the ministry of defense did not reply to a letter sent in June to obtain information in advance of the report's publication. We repeat again our willingness to meet with you and other responsible defense ministry officials to discuss the expulsions of civilians from south Lebanon and the recommendations that we have made to your government and the international community. Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and I look forward to a reply at your earliest convenience.

Urged To Demand Progress On Tunisian Human Rights","","11/04/1999","We are writing to you regarding the European Union's upcoming Association Council meeting with Tunisia on November 16-17. The Association Agreement was signed on July 17, 1995 by the European Community and E.U. member states on the one hand and by the Republic of Tunisia on the other hand, and came into force on March 1, 1998. The Agreement includes a legally binding human rights clause.(1)Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guide their domestic and international policies and constitute an essential element of the Agreement. Our organizations believe the E.U. Council of Ministers and the European Commission have an obligation to use Association Council meetings to raise concrete human rights concerns and press for verifiable progress The lack of improvement in the human rights situation since the E.U.-Tunisian Agreement took effect poses an acute challenge to the Agreement and to E.U. policy toward the Mediterranean region. How the E.U. proceeds in this regard toward Tunisia, the first and still the only country where an Association Agreement has come into effect, will have precedential impact on the E.U.'s credibility and effectiveness in treating human rights issues with its future Euro-Mediterranean partners. France's National Consultative Human Rights Commission has urged that the Association Council, at its upcoming meeting, take up as a """"priority"""" the """"degradation of public liberties and human rights in Tunisia.""""(2) It is in this context that we would like to share with you our current concerns with respect to the human rights situation in Tunisia. Repression of all dissenting voices The human rights situation began to deteriorate in 1990, following a brief period of reform initiated by President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. The repression that targeted Islamists first and foremost was broadened to cover leftists and all other opposition political tendencies, student leaders, professional associations, the media, and others.  Today, known or suspected government opponents and critics across the political spectrum risk detention simply for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of opinion, expression, and association. Thousands of known or suspected political opponents have been tortured and imprisoned after unfair trials over the past decade. More than 1,000 remain in prison and are detained under conditions that amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Their relatives are targeted for harassment, intimidation, deprivation of passports, and detention. Former prisoners of conscience are required to report to the police on a regular basis. Those who must report one or more times daily are often thereby prevented from working and resuming a normal life. Wives of exiled political opponents are often prevented from leaving the country with their children to reunite their families; those who in desperation attempted to leave the country without a passport have been imprisoned.  Many ordinary Tunisians who worked or studied abroad were arrested when they returned home to visit their families, and were imprisoned on charges of contacts with political opponents abroad. Those who have provided financial support, however modest, to relatives of political prisoners and of exiled opponents have themselves been prosecuted on charges of supporting """"unauthorized associations."""" Unfair trials: A judiciary lacking independence  When it comes to trials involving political charges, Tunisian courts fail to guarantee the most basic rights of defendants to a fair trial. This was starkly illustrated by the trial of twenty-one defendants, thirteen of them students, in a single twenty-hour session before the Tunis Court of First Instance on July 10, 1999. This trial was observed by numerous representatives of European and other embassies, bar associations, and human rights organizations. (AI, FIDH, and HRW sent observers to the trial and will be publishing a report on it shortly.) Sixteen of the accused had been in detention since their arrest in early 1998, following demonstrations that broke out on campuses over the conditions of study. They were initially charged with belonging to a criminal and terrorist gang, holding unauthorized meetings, defamation of the judiciary, and other charges. The sixteen defendants who had been in pretrial detention all disavowed their """"confessions"""" and said, almost without exception, that they had been tortured into signing. They described to the court methods of torture that included beatings on sensitive parts of the body, tying hands behind the back while hanging the person from the ceiling by the wrists; and the """"poulet rôti"""" method of tying the wrists together under the knees and passing a pole horizontally between arms and thighs. (For more on the practice of torture, see FIDH, Tunisie: des violations caractérisées, graves et systématiques, Rapport alternatif au deuxième rapport périodique de la Tunisie au Comité contre la torture de l'ONU, rapport FIDH no. 267, novembre 1998.) The defendants were systematically refused medical examinations despite having exercised their right under Tunisian law to request them. The defendants were also prevented from calling witnesses whom they said would refute the date of arrest as recorded by the police. Thus, the judge prevented the defendants from challenging their """"confessions"""" and instead used these as the main evidence to convict them all. Despite the purely political and nonviolent nature of the offenses being prosecuted, twenty of the defendants--including the three in hiding--received prison sentences ranging from fifteen months to nine years and three months (criminal judgment in case no. 21018/009 21080/099/6, dated July 14, 1999, court of first instance in Tunis). Today, seven of these defendants remain in prison; they have undertaken numerous hunger strikes (the last in October 1999) to protest the reasons and conditions of their detention, and the lack of investigation into their allegations of torture. Increased targeting of human rights defenders The government of Tunisia expends considerable effort to promote its image as a beacon of human rights. These efforts include vast public relations campaigns overseas, often assisted by obscure non-governmental associations of dubious independence. At home, human rights departments exist within at least four ministries, a state-appointed Higher Committee for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms supposedly monitors the practices of the government, human rights counselors are supposed to relate human rights concerns directly to President Ben Ali, and an ombudsman's office exists to handle citizens' complaints.  While the official human rights bureaucracy flourishes, members of the independent rights community and their relatives have been increasingly targeted for repression. This targeting aims to impede and punish those who stand up for human rights, and thereby to deprive victims of human rights violations of any defense. Tunisia's conduct violates the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by consensus--and hence with Tunisia's approval--by the U.N. General Assembly on December 9, 1998. Khemaïs Ksila, a vice-president of the independent Tunisian Human Rights League (Ligue Tunisienne de défense de droits de l'Homme, LTDH), was arrested in September 1997 and sentenced to three years imprisonment solely for issuing a communiqué protesting the harassment and intimidation to which he and his family were subjected, and condemning the worsening human rights situation in Tunisia. After much national and international pressure, he was freed conditionally on September 22, 1999. He was briefly rearrested the following day, after giving interviews to foreign media, and cautioned against making further public statements. Ksila's release, however welcome, comes after he spent two years in prison for exercising his right to nonviolent speech and should hardly be considered an """"improvement"""" in the human rights situation. While one high-profile political prisoner has been released, more than 1,000 others remain in prison. Human rights activists who, like Ksila, publicly question the Tunisian authorities' intolerance of dissent, continue to face harassment, deprivation of passports, and other measures. And Ksila, although out of prison, remains without a passport and dismissed from his public-sector job. His telephone line has been disconnected since his release. His wife, Fatima Ksila, is also unable to obtain a passport and in March 1999 their eleven-year-old son was prevented from leaving the country to go to Cairo to receive a prize on behalf of his father conferred by the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists. Khemaïs Ksila's plight recalls that of human rights lawyer Nejib Hosni, who three years ago was freed early from a prison sentence he never should have served, remains without a passport, and is barred from resuming the practice of law. (On the trumped-up case against Nejib Hosni, see the detailed analysis in Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Nejib Hosni: A Tunisian Lawyer Singled Out for Exemplary Punishment for Defending Human Rights and Upholding the Rule of Law, New York: Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, April 1996.) Radhia Nasraoui, a member of the executive committee of the Tunisian Bar Council, has endured years of harassment and intimidation because of her human rights activities. In March 1998, after joining the defense team representing the young political activists whose case was described above, Nasraoui was indicted as their co-conspirator and thereby disqualified from representing them. For a year and-a-half she was banned from leaving the capital, a measure that prevented her from visiting clients and being present in courts elsewhere in the country. In July 1999 she was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended, in the above-mentioned trial. In addition, she and her children and several other relatives have continued to be harassed and intimidated, and her children have been refused passports. Dr. Moncef Marzouki, former President of the LTDH and current spokesperson for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil National des Libertés en Tunisie, CNLT) and Omar Mestiri, member of the CNLT, were arrested on June 5 and May 12 respectively. Marzouki was seized, abduction-style, on a street in Tunis by plainclothes police who lacked a warrant. He was then held in secret detention for two days and questioned about CNLT communiqués on human rights developments. Since May, Omar Mestiri has been forbidden to travel to his place of work outside the capital. His wife, Sihem Ben Sedrine, herself a former board member of the LTDH, has also been denied a passport since 1995. In an apparent instance of relatives being punished for the activism of their kin, Mohamed Ali Bedoui, a brother of Dr. Marzouki, was imprisoned for six months in 1998 and again in 1999 for refusing to comply with arbitrary surveillance measures. Other members of the CNLT who have been deprived of passports include human rights lawyer Nejib Hosni, previously imprisoned in 1994 for over two years on spurious charges motivated by his human rights activities, journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, and cardiologist Mustapha Ben Jaafar. In May 1999 Taoufik Ben Brik was arrested and interrogated for several hours; in the preceding weeks he had been attacked outside his home in Tunis in broad daylight by individuals armed with chains. His wife, Azza, had her car windows smashed as she was shopping with their two young children.  Other human rights lawyers, including 85-year-old Mohamed Chakroun, a former minister of justice and head of the Bar Council, and Jamaleddine Bida, a former secretary general of the Bar Council, have also been unable to obtain their passports despite repeated attempts. The above are but a few examples of the tactics used by the authorities to prevent and discourage Tunisians from working to defend the rights of others. In addition to those mentioned above, numerous human rights lawyers and activists have been and continue to be subjected to measures of harassment and intimidation that inflict harm on their social, professional and family lives. Their clients, friends, and relatives are intimidated by security agents who follow them or approach them to check their identity papers or question them. The cutoff of telephone lines and the confiscation of mail further disrupts family and professional life and heightens their vulnerability, especially in emergency situations.  Restrictions on the press and on civil society The situation that prompted the Paris-based World Association of Newspapers to expel its Tunisian affiliate in 1997 remains unchanged. Tunisia's television, radio, and daily press contain no criticism of the authorities and ignore all information emanating from Tunisian and international non-governmental organizations that might imply criticism of government policies. Tunisia's private newspapers are indistinguishable in tone from the official ones. Only a few smaller periodicals such as al-Mawqif deviate from the official line, and they do so with caution. Human rights, civil liberties, and professional associations are under close surveillance and face harassment for expressing even mild criticisms of the government's human rights record or policies. Their critical statements are ignored by the local media, and fear of retaliation by the authorities often inhibits them from distributing such statements abroad. The Tunisian League for Human Rights remains hobbled in its work by the surveillance conducted by plainclothes police of its members and offices, which dissuades Tunisians from joining the LTDH or from bringing human rights complaints to it. The LTDH's activities are systematically ignored by the daily press. And about one year ago, the government raised objections to and blocked a grant that the European Commission had approved for the LTDH.  Other well-established NGOs like the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (Association Tunisienne des Femmes Démocrates, ATFD) or the Association of Young Lawyers (Association des Jeunes Avocats, AJA) and their members face impediments related to their efforts to take independent positions on current issues. Their activities are hindered at the regional and international level by intimidating police surveillance and by the fact that many of their active members have been deprived of passports at one time or another. Attempts to create new civil rights associations have been stifled by the government's refusal to grant such groups the necessary authorization. For example, the CNLT, which was created on December 10, 1998, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was refused authorization by the ministry of the interior in March 1999 and its members have been continuously harassed (see above). Trade unionists who have voiced concern at the increasing control by the authorities of the Tunisian General Trade Union (Union Générale Tunisienne du Travail, UGTT) have also been targeted. In May 1999 at least ten trade unionists who had signed petitions and made declarations condemning government interference in the UGTT's affairs were arrested and detained for up to a few days. Surveillance and blocking of communications via mail, telephone, fax and the Internet make it difficult for Tunisian NGOs and activists to communicate regularly and freely with each others at home and abroad. A postal law decreed June 2, 1998 provides that """"postal materials that...could harm public order or security are not acceptable. If [such] mail is found...it will be confiscated in conformity with the laws in effect."""" The World Wide Web sites of some international human rights organizations, media, and U.N. human rights bodies are inaccessible much or most of the time and others are blocked on particular occasions. For example, the website of certain French newspapers, television and radio stations were rendered inaccessible on days they carried items critical of the Tunisian authorities. Further restrictions around the October 1999 elections The government of Tunisia heralded the presidential and legislative elections of October 24 as a milestone in the country's democratization, noting that opposition parties would be guaranteed 20 percent of the parliamentary seats regardless of the electoral returns and that, for the first time, the presidential ballot would include more than one candidate. In the event, the official tally of the presidential elections recorded 99.44 percent for incumbent president Ben Ali and 92 percent of the parliamentary vote for his ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally party. Other parties gained seats not through the ballot box but through set-asides whose distribution was decided upon by the administration. On the essential question of whether Tunisians feel free to speak, associate, and assemble with respect to the issues that concern them at election time, the answer remains: only so long as they refrain from directly challenging the policy course of the authorities. Participation is permitted only to those parties that are legally recognized, which at this time excludes all those that propose clear alternatives to the policies of the present government. The one legal party that challenged mildly the government's program in 1995, the Social Democratic Movement (Mouvement des Démocrates Socialistes, MDS), saw its leader, Mohamed Mouada, arrested and sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment on spurious charges and replaced by a more compliant leadership. Mouada was released in 1996 after much international pressure but remains under close surveillance, his passport confiscated and his telephone disconnected. On October 28, 1999 Dr. Mustapha Ben Jaafar, a co-founder both of the CNLT and the Democratic Forum (Forum Démocratique), a political association that applied in 1994 for legal registration but never received a reply, was arrested at his home and detained for several hours at the Carthage police station. He was questioned about a statement he had issued on behalf of the Democratic Forum criticizing the election outcome and the atmosphere in which it took place. Ben Jaafar was warned that he would face prosecution for maintaining an unauthorized association. In the days preceding the elections the telephone lines of several human rights lawyers, activists, and government critics were disrupted in an apparent attempt to curtail their communications with foreign journalists visiting Tunisia to cover the elections. Tunisia's record on women's rights Since independence, women in Tunisia have made impressive strides in the securing of their rights. The Personal Status Code adopted under former President Habib Bourguiba gave women many legal rights they did not previously enjoy. The illiteracy rate for women has dropped and their presence in higher education and in the workforce has grown. At the same time, women are no less restricted than men with respect to the exercise of their political and civil rights. When the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD) tries to highlight areas where the treatment of women could improve--through communiqués, public awareness campaigns, meetings, and rallies--its efforts are stymied. Public gatherings are often barred by the authorities, members such as lawyer Najet Yacoubi are under constant surveillance, and the pro-government media ignore its activities, except to suggest the association is """"libertine"""" or """"lesbian"""" or to misrepresent it in other ways. In addition, authorities systematically harass the wives of suspected Islamists who are in jail or exile, through detention, surveillance, searches without warrants, incessant police questioning, and confiscation of passports. Several women have been put under pressure by police to divorce their jailed or exiled husbands. These abuses were raised this year in the report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on violence against women (E/CN.4/1999/68/Add.1). Another area where much progress must still be made with respect to women's rights is domestic violence. According to the ATFD, which runs the country's only shelter for women victims of violence, domestic violence is commonplace. Yet government officials have not acknowledged this and, according to women's rights activists, a climate of impunity prevails because police officers fail to investigate incidents adequately and judges tend to dismiss domestic violence as a family matter. Again, restrictions on political rights are part of the problem: the ATFD has long been calling on the government to secure the right of independent organizations to work freely to combat violence against women. Human rights violations in Tunisia--and their impact in Europe European countries have been touched in a variety of ways by the repression in Tunisia. Article 305 of the Code of Criminal Procedure permits the prosecution of Tunisians for certain acts committed abroad that violate Tunisian law, even if those activities are perfectly legal in the countries in which they took place. A recent and not atypical case involves Nizar Chaâri, who was jailed on May 29, 1998 while visiting home after earning his doctorate in agronomy at the University of Toulouse in France. After spending nearly a year in pretrial detention, he was convicted of attending an """"illegal"""" meeting that was alleged to have taken place outside of Tunisia more than a decade earlier. Conditionally freed in June 1999, Chaâri remains in Tunisia, where he is required to report daily to the police and is unable to obtain a passport. These restrictions prevent him from taking a post-doctoral post that the University of Toulouse has offered him. Systematic violation of the right to freedom of movement The arbitrary deprivation of passports has been one of the abuses most commonly used not only against human rights activists and known or suspected political opponents, but also against their relatives. This policy has caused great suffering among the families of political refugees living in European countries. Although some of these cases have been resolved in recent years thanks to international pressure, including démarches made by E.U. member governments, many families remain divided because of this vindictive policy. To cite just three examples: Rachida Ben Salem is the wife of M'barek Sghaier M'barek, a Tunisian refugee living in the Netherlands. Radhia Aouididi is the fiancée of Ahmed Amri, a refugee living in France, and the sister of Noureddine Aouididi, a refugee in the United Kingdom. Souad Charbti is the wife of Abdelaziz Bousnina, a refugee in Switzerland. In separate incidents each of the women tried to flee the country to join their partners, after their passport applications had been refused and they had been denied the possibility of departing through legal means. They were arrested--Charbti in the company of the couple's four children and Ben Salem with her two children--and imprisoned on charges relating primarily to their attempted flight.  In June 1999 all three women were released conditionally from prison. While their release is welcome, they should never have been imprisoned in the first place. Moreover, the lives of all three women are currently circumscribed by the obligation to report daily at police stations and by the continued refusal of authorities to issue them passports. Rachida Ben Salem and her children, now eight and ten years old, have not seen their husband and father since the children were very young. Charbti and her children, who range from eight to fourteen years of age, have not seen Abdelaziz Bousnina for eight years. Aouididi, meanwhile, is to go on trial on new and spurious charges of """"links with an unauthorized association"""" on November 25. These charges, which had been brought against her last year on account of her relation and contact with her fiancé and brother abroad, had initially been dropped but were later reinstated on appeal by the prosecutor. Others deprived of passports include sociologist Salah Hamzaoui of the University of Tunis, who has been denied a passport since 1997, and is thus unable to reach Paris to complete his doctoral work. On October 11, 1999 his son, student leader Yassine Hamzaoui, was also refused a passport, preventing him from enrolling this semester at the University of Montreal. Restrictions on foreign media Tunisia's intolerance of dissent has other European repercussions as well. Foreign publications are banned from circulation whenever they contain critical coverage of Tunisia, at considerable cost to those publications. The Parisian dailies Le Monde and Libération were barred from circulation fourteen and seven times respectively during the first half of 1999, according to Reporters sans Frontières. The London-based Arabic daily al-Quds al-Arabi and the French monthly Le Monde Diplomatique and daily La Croix are among the publications that have been kept out of the country at one time or another. European television stations are sometimes blocked or jammed after broadcasting criticism of Tunisia. Most recently, transmission of France 2 was blocked beginning on October 25, shortly after broadcasting an interview with the French authors of Notre ami Ben Ali, a new book critical of the Tunisian president. Taoufik Ben Brik, a Tunisian correspondent for several European news media, including La Croix, the Switzerland-based Info-Sud news agency, and the France-based Syfia agency, has been the target of steady harassment as one of the few Tunisian journalists who writes critically of the human rights situation (see above). Preventing Tunisians from attending European Parliament human rights hearing In June 1997, several political groups in the European Parliament sponsored a forum on human rights in Tunisia in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement. The government of Tunisia exerted strong pressure on the invited Tunisians not to attend and directly prevented some from leaving the country. One human rights activist who managed to come and testify, Khemaïs Chammari, has since remained in exile, fearing reprisals for his human rights activities if he were to return. With Chammari beyond the reach of the authorities, his wife, lawyer Alya Chérif-Chammari, is harassed and kept under surveillance. In addition, his brother Abderraouf was arrested in July and given a one-year sentence because of a comment he was accused of uttering in a private conversation that was deemed defamatory of the president's family. After spending two months behind bars, Abderraouf Chammari, a senior public servant and former deputy mayor of Tunis, was released on what officials called humanitarian grounds.  International awareness of the human rights situation in Tunisia · European Union E.U. member states are well aware of human rights violations and restrictions of civil liberties and freedoms of expression and association in Tunisia. The Evaluation of the Meda Democracy Programme 1996-1998, prepared for the European Commission and issued in March, cites Tunisia in Section 2.9 as one of the Euro-Mediterranean countries where serious problems exist in carrying out human rights and civil liberties promotion activities: Syria and Tunisia received the lowest share [of funds] both in terms of grants per country and per capita. This reflects the severe political obstacles to directly assist NGOs in these countries without agreement by the government and the totalitarian nature of the political systems in Syria and Tunisia. As mentioned above, the Tunisian government successfully blocked a grant that the European Commission had approved for the Tunisian League for Human Rights. It was not the only instance over the past year where authorities stood in the way of an E.C. grant to an applicant from Tunisia's civil society. The government, as noted, also did its best to ensure that Tunisian human rights activists did not attend the human rights hearing on Tunisia organized by parties in the European Parliament in 1997. · The United Nations The U.N. human rights mechanisms present a stark picture of the situation in Tunisia. In November 1998 the U.N. Committee Against Torture examined the government of Tunisia's report (which was submitted four years late) and declared itself """"disturbed by the reported widespread practice of torture"""" and """"concerned over the pressure and intimidation used by officials to prevent the victims from lodging complaints."""" The committee charged that by denying these allegations, """"the authorities are in fact granting those responsible for torture immunity from punishment, thus encouraging the continuation of these abhorrent practices."""" The committee urged the government to ensure strict enforcement of the provisions of the law and procedures of arrest and police custody. (See the Concluding Observations of the Committee against Torture, CAT/C/TUN, November 19, 1998.) At the same time, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, who in October 1998 requested to conduct a working visit to Tunisia, has received no invitation. (On a more positive note, the Tunisian government recently invited the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, who has been requesting permission for a mission since December 1997.)  In its 1998 and 1999 sessions, the U.N. Sub-Commission on Human Rights expressed concern at the cases of human rights defenders Khemaïs Ksila and Radhia Nasraoui (mentioned above). In May 1999 the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued its finding that the detention of Khemaïs Ksila was arbitrary. In October 1994, the U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the human rights situation and urged the government of Tunisia to implement a series of recommendations so as to bring Tunisia into compliance with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (See the Comments of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, adopted November 2, 1994, CCPR/C/79/Add.43.) To date, none of the key recommendations has been implemented in practice. The next Tunisian government's report to the U.N. Human Rights Committee was due in February 1998 but has not been submitted. Recommendations to the E.U. Council of Ministers and the European Commission At the E.U.-Tunisia Association Committee meeting in Tunis on June 25, the European Presidency, in a declaration, affirmed the E.U.'s intention to raise human rights concerns at all appropriate levels. The declaration also affirmed the E.U.'s view that economic and social progress can only be realized in open societies, regulated by the rule of law. AI, HRW, FIDH, and RSF call on the E.U. Council of Ministers and the European Commission to urge Tunisia to fulfill its obligations under the Association Agreement and international human rights law by, among other things:  · freeing all persons detained or imprisoned solely for the nonviolent exercise of the right to speech, association, or assembly; · restoring the right to freedom of movement to all persons who are arbitrarily deprived of passports; · ending all forms of harassment against human rights activists and their relatives by, among other measures, restoring their passports, telephone, and fax service where these have been deprived; by ending police surveillance that is manifestly conducted as a form of intimidation; and by allowing all independent human rights organizations including the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia to function legally and freely, in conformity with the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; · instituting effective safeguards to prevent the use of torture against persons in police custody; and · instituting a credible and transparent system for investigating allegations of abuse and ensuring that human rights abusers are identified and brought to justice.  Moreover, Tunisia should be urged to cease obstructing European Commission efforts to provide grants to Tunisian non-governmental associations that seek such funding. We also urge the E.U. Council of Ministers and the European Commission to apply consistently Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement in accordance with international human rights standards. A credible human rights approach should not only provide the basis for programs to enhance human rights protection and promotion, but also involve concrete actions in the event of sustained and serious abuses.  We therefore call on the E.U. Council of Ministers and the European Commission to put in place mechanisms to regularly assess compliance with Article 2 by all contracting parties to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement. These should include:  · regular and impartial monitoring of developments in the field of human rights and civil liberties in the territory of any of the contracting parties; · monitoring of the extent to which human rights defenders are free to act and speak out in defense of the rights of others;  · issuing specific recommendations, compliance with which can be regularly measured, that are aimed at addressing improving the human rights situation and that take into account the recommendations made by the U.N. human rights bodies about the country concerned. · making appropriate démarches towards partner countries in individual cases where violations of basic human rights standards have taken place; and · making the assessment of compliance with Article 2 a separate agenda item in all meetings held under the Agreement, and especially the Association Council meetings.  In conclusion, we believe that full implementation of the Association Agreement with Tunisia requires the E.U. to raise concrete human rights concerns and press for verifiable progress on the basis of the recommendations specified above. In light of Tunisia's grave human rights situation, the Council of Ministers and the Commission should not miss the opportunity to do so at the upcoming Association Council meeting.

This case is a dramatic and tragic reminder that there are scores of Lebanese citizens and Palestinians who are known or believed to be imprisoned in Syria following their """"disappearances"""" on Lebanese soil. The families of these individuals have received no official notification from Syrian authorities of the whereabouts of their loved ones. The families also do not know why their relatives are being held and have no information about the legal basis for their continued detention. Letters that Human Rights Watch has written on behalf of some of the families to Your Excellency and other Syrian officials have gone unanswered. With respect to the case of Adel Khalaf Ajouri, we respectfully request information from Syrian authorities about the date and circumstances of his transfer from Lebanon to Syria and the charges that justified his detention in Syria for over nine years. If Mr. Ajouri was tried and sentenced in a Syrian court, we request information about the exact charges against him and details about the legal proceedings, including any appeals process. In addition, given the unexplained circumstances of Mr. Ajouri's death in custody, we also respectfully request a copy of the official autopsy report and death certificate. On behalf of the other Lebanese and Palestinians who """"disappeared"""" in Lebanon and may currently be in custody in Syria, Human Rights Watch reiterates the recommendations that we first made to the Syrian government in 1997: * Make public the names of all non-Syrians—including Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians —who are currently detained or imprisoned in Syria. * In addition to releasing the names, make public the following additional information about each individual: 1. Nationality or place of permanent residence, and date of birth; 2. Date and place of initial arrest, and the name of the security force that took the person into custody; 3. Date of transfer from Lebanon to Syria, and the basis in Syrian or Lebanese law, if any, for such transfer; 4. Name and location of the facility where the person is currently being held in Syria; 5. Whether the person has been permitted to contact his family and lawyer, and the date on which such contact was initially made; 6. Whether the person has been permitted family visits, and the frequency of such visits; and 7. The basis in Syrian or Lebanese law for the continuing detention and imprisonment of each person held in Syria. * Individuals who are unlawfully detained should be immediately and unconditionally released. * The Syrian government should instruct its judicial authorities to determine, on a case-by-case basis, if foreign nationals and stateless Palestinians have been subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention in Syria. In cases of arbitrary arrest or detention, authorities should set forth and disseminate widely in Lebanon information about the official legal mechanisms by which victims can exercise their enforceable right to compensation, as provided in Article 9(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Syria is a state party. * To ensure that individuals in the future are not subjected to arbitrary arrest or """"disappearance,"""" Syrian authorities should undertake the following measures: 1. Communicate to all Syrian military, intelligence and security forces that """"disappearances"""" will no longer be tolerated, and that commanders who order or condone such actions will be held responsible for these criminal offenses to the fullest extent of the law. 2. Require that at the time of arrest or detention, the arresting authorities identify themselves, and that all individuals take into custody be held only in publicly recognized detention facilities, where accurate registers of detainees and prisoners are maintained and available for public inspection. Such procedures should be instituted at each of the now-secret Syrian detention facilities in Lebanon — alternatively, these centers should be closed. 3. Inform individuals taken into custody of the reasons for arrest, and enable them to challenge the legality of their detention before a judicial authority. 4. Permit individuals taken into custody to inform without delay their relatives and lawyers of their arrest and place of detention. 5. Establish effective procedures for prompt response to inquiries from families, lawyers and nongovernmental organizations about the whereabouts of individuals who have been detained. Your Excellency, """"disappearances"""" are among the gravest crimes in international law and may constitute crimes against humanity, whether committed in times of war or times of peace. The Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitation to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity makes clear that accountability for crimes against humanity """"apply to representatives of the State authority and private individuals who, as principals or accomplices, participate in or who directly incite others"""" to commit the crimes, or """"who conspire to commit them, irrespective of the degree of completion, and to representatives of the State authority who tolerate their commission."""" We therefore strongly recommend that Syrian authorities fully account for all """"disappeared"""" individuals who may currently be in its custody and release them immediately. We have enclosed with this letter an Arabic translation of """"An Alliance Beyond the Law,"""" our 1997 report that documented """"disappearances"""" of Lebanese citizens and Palestinians in Lebanese territory.

Human Rights Watch has no information regarding possible military targets in the village. The Russian attack struck homes inhabited by dozens of noncombatants. Beginning late at night on Oct 26, Russian shells fell with increasing intensity on Samashki. """"We had taken shelter in our neighbors' basement,"""" recalled Malika Abudullaeva, a thirty-year-old school teacher. """"There were about seventy people with us underground, including many children and babies."""" At 11:00 p.m. on October 27, Abdullaeva took advantage of a lull in the shelling to leave the shelter and look for food, together with her twenty-five-year-old sister, Satsita. As they returned to the basement, the house standing above the shelter suffered a direct hit. The two sisters, located some fifteen yards away, were thrown to the ground by the force of the blast. Malika was hit by shrapnel in her right thigh, while Satsita was wounded in her back and left leg. """"People ran out of the basement and dragged us inside,"""" Satsita recalled, """"and we learned that a young girl had been killed and that others were wounded."""" Because no bandages were available, their injuries were bound with torn cloths. Louiza Abaeva, a thirty-year-old Samashki resident, said that Russian shells """"landed on the whole area of the village,"""" on October 27. She said her shoulder wounds were caused by explosives launched from two Russian war planes strafing the village at 10:00 am. The planes scored a direct hit on two nearby homes, killing two women and three children from the Abdukadirov family, and blowing off the leg of twelve year old Zelimkhan Yakuev. Madina Avturkhanova, a twenty-year-old woman, said she too was hit by an explosive during a lull in the October 27 shelling.

According to Ruslan Maskurov, the vice premiere of Ingushetia, Russian federal forces """"do not permit anyone, including doctors or nurses,"""" to access the displaced persons column. """"We cannot do anything for those stuck on the Chechen side of the border,"""" Maskurov told Human Rights Watch. Some 200,000 Chechens have already fled to Ingushetia, placing a heavy strain on the tiny republic's indigenous population of 347,000. Ingush authorities have protested the border closure, saying they are willing to provide a safe haven for Chechnya's noncombatant population. The head of the line of displaced persons is three miles from the nearest Ingush border post. Russian commanders argue that the threat of infiltration and terrorism requires that they rigorously screen Chechen civilians seeking to leave the embattled republic. According to Chechens who have been through the process, the federal authorities have erected a complex security screening procedure: officials check the record of each individual through a computerized databank, search their baggage, and question them vigorously. This cumbersome apparatus is unable to quickly process the flow of displaced Chechens. Officials at the border have stated that 153 persons crossed into Ingushetia on November 1, followed by 423 people on Nov 2. The figure for November 3 at 5 p.m. was 1026, an encouraging increase that may have been prompted by a flurry of official border visits by United Nations representatives and Russian federal authorities. As long as the cumbersome screening procedure remains in effect, however, the column of displaced civilians is likely to grow. Despite mounting domestic and international attention, Russian forces refuse to grant journalists access to the column of displaced persons. Ingush officials, relief workers, and medical personnel are also denied access, complicating attempts to provide a minimum of basic care. Several civilians have already died in the column, reportedly as a result of heart failure. A senior Ingush police officer told Human Rights Watch that the authorities are sending bread and water across the border, but said he was unable to verify if the supplies were reaching the intended beneficiaries. """"We have no access and thus have no idea if we are helping,"""" he said. The Russian military should allow immediate and unimpeded access to the column of displaced persons by Ingush authorities, relief agencies, human rights monitors, and the media. By placing tens of thousands of civilians in effective quarantine, Russian forces are violating their international obligations to protect civilians.

Kheidi, a 37-year-old woman who crossed the Chechen border early Wednesday morning, said that Russian warplanes bombed the village of Starye Atagi on Monday and Tuesday, killing nine civilians. According to other witnesses, Russian forces are still besieging Grozny. Zarema Badayeva, a wounded 26-year-old Grozny woman who crossed into Ingushetia Wednesday afternoon, told Human Rights Watch that Russian forces are """"bombing everywhere"""" and that the remaining residents are """"terrified to leave their basements."""" All essential services in the capital have collapsed, and the population has no gas, electricity, or fresh food. """"You live on what you have stocked in your basement or you starve,"""" said a 62-year-old woman at the border. The Russian shelling complicates medical evacuations. Kheidi's seven-year-old daughter was hit by Russian shrapnel in her knee, ankle, and back on October 23. """"She lay in Grozny city hospital for five days,"""" Kheidi said. """"And than we ran to Starye Atagi to escape the shelling."""" When that village was hit by Russian warplanes on November 1 and 2, Kheidi fled again with her daughter to the Sunzha district hospital, located in Sleptsovsk, a few miles inside Ingushetia. As a result of the travel and inadequate care, Kheidi was forced to have her daughter's leg amputated above the knee. Kheidi said that both the Grozny and Starye Atagi hospitals were understaffed, undersupplied, and overwhelmed by new patients. Zarima Badayeva, whose left pelvic bone was shattered in the October 21 market bombing in Grozny, took shelter on Verkhnaya Street for 12 days, leaving only once for first-aid treatment in the Grozny city hospital. On November 3, her family decided to make a run for the Ingush border. """"We crammed six people into our car,"""" 32-year-old Gamza Badayev said, """"and we finally got through after waiting hours at the border."""" Another woman interviewed in the Sunzha hospital said she was forced to wait at the Ingush-Chechen border for three days after being wounded by Russian shellfire on October 27. Although she had suffered a shrapnel wound in her right shoulder, Russian border troops blocked her from crossing until November 1. Human Rights Watch calls on Russian field commanders to cease attacks on civilian objects, as well as carpet bombing or other means of attack that indiscriminately strike civilians and combatants alike. The Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, to which Russia is a party, as well as the customary international law of war, emphasize the principle of civilian immunity. This body of law prohibits attacks - even when aimed at legitimate military targets - if they are indiscriminate or disproportionately harmful to civilians in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Humanitarian law also requires precautions to protect the civilian population, such as effective advance warning. Human Rights Watch also urges the Russian authorities to announce well-enforced pauses in the bombing by leaflet and radio, which may help civilians trapped in Chechen combat zones to escape the fighting. Russian authorities must also allow unimpeded freedom of movement to wounded civilians seeking to cross the Ingush border. Blocking access to a safe area out of the conflict zone violates Russia's international obligations to protect civilians. These are inscribed in the Geneva Conventions and in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

General Assembly to press the U.S. government to return intact evidence of death-squad crimes to Haitian law enforcement officials. U.S. troops entering Haiti on September 19, 1994 seized approximately 160,000 documents and other materials from Haitian paramilitary and military headquarters, and Washington has said that it will only return the materials once U.S. citizens' names have been deleted. The government of Haiti has insisted that the documents must not be tampered with. Today, the United Nations independent expert on human rights in Haiti, Adama Dieng of Senegal, in his report to the General Assembly, repeated his appeal to the United States to return the seized materials promptly and without alterations. Dieng has made such pleas in the past, but the U.S. has refused to heed them. This time, Dieng called on the General Assembly to adopt a resolution seeking the return of the documents. Dieng noted that the information constituted a rich source of evidence for the prosecution of those guilty of abuses during Haiti's 1991-1994 military regime. """"These thugs terrorized Haiti for three years, murdering, torturing and raping,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The United States has taken away a potential gold-mine of evidence which could help bring some of these people to justice and now won't give it back."""" U.S. forces seized the documents and other materials from paramilitary FRAPH (Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti) and Haitian military offices in the fall of 1994, reportedly including """"trophy"""" photographs of torture victims, audio and videotapes of torture sessions, membership applications for FRAPH, passports, identification cards, and business records. The material was taken to the United States without the knowledge or consent of Haitian authorities. The U.S. government has maintained that U.S. citizens' names and identifying information must be deleted from the materials before they are returned to Haitian custody. This apparently serves the illegitimate purpose of covering up possible U.S. complicity in political murder and other abuses, particularly the apparent involvement of U.S. intelligence agents with the military regime and FRAPH. FRAPH reportedly was founded with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assistance and Emmanuel """"Toto"""" Constant, its director, repeatedly stated that he received regular CIA payments. Constant was detained in the U.S. and ordered deported by a U.S. immigration judge who found that """"allowing [Constant] to remain in the United States fosters the impression that the United States endorses FRAPH and its actions."""" Nevertheless, on June 14, 1996, the Clinton administration released him into the United States rather than return him to Haiti, provided him with a work permit, and required that he abide by a gag order. He now lives in Queens, New York. """"The Clinton Administration's refusal to hand back this evidence, its insistence on shielding the identity of Americans involved with Haiti's criminals, and the protection it offers to the most wanted man in Haiti all point to a continuing cover-up of U.S. wrongdoing in Haiti,"""" said Brody.","Americas, United States, Haiti",""

Detention centers around the state often lack adequate education and medical care, including mental health care. Youth in all of the facilities in the five counties visited by Human Rights Watch complained that they did not get enough to eat. In many of Maryland's smaller jails, children are mixed in with adults, often sharing cells with them. The lack of separate juvenile housing violates international standards. """"Maryland should not be locking children up in these adult jails,"""" said Michael Bochenek, Counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This practice violates the fundamental rights of the child."""" The 169 page report, """"No Minor Matter: Children in Maryland's Jails,"""" found the worst conditions for children in the Baltimore City Detention Center. Juveniles are confined to dimly-lit, squalid cells crawling with cockroaches and rodents and subject to extreme temperatures. Violence between inmates is rampant and may include """"shanks,"""" or weapons fashioned from pieces of metal from air vents or old light fixtures. Some jail guards have condoned and even organized fights between youth, known as """"square dances,"""" which have resulted in serious injuries. Maryland is one of forty states that have made it easier to try children as adults. As a consequence of the national trend to move more children into the criminal justice system, a growing number of children are held in adult facilities while they await trial. The national crime rate for adolescents has actually fallen every year since 1993. """"Treating children brutally is not going to help the crime rate,"""" said Bochenek. """"Children do not belong in jails with adults, no matter what crime they have committed."""" Children in the Baltimore City Detention Center may be confined to cells in the disciplinary segregation section for as long as six months. Entire units may be subjected to collective punishments known as """"lockdowns"""", where inmates are confined to their cells for weeks at a time, denied visits from family members and allowed out only for classes, and two or three showers per week. One facility studied for the report, Prince George's County Correctional Center, had no educational programs at all for its juvenile detainees. Young inmates may spend up months in the center with no educational opportunities, in flagrant violation of state and federal law and international standards. In other facilities, the number of hours of classroom instruction frequently fell far short of the requirements of federal and state law. Mental health services in Baltimore's jail are minimal to nonexistent, with no services specifically for juveniles. Although children in adult jails may be eight times more likely to commit suicide than their peers in juvenile detention centers, children in the Baltimore jail have no therapeutic groups or individual counseling. Inmates in crisis are placed in a mental health unit, where they are often kept naked, with nothing more than paper blankets to cover their bodies. Children in adult facilities are often exposed to adult inmates or placed in the same unit with adults. Contrary to international guidelines, children may have daily contact with adults, or even share cells. One youth in the Baltimore City Detention Center told Human Rights Watch that adults detainees in his section continually harassed him by throwing excrement and urine into his cell. After complaints yielded no results, he resorted to telling guards that he was suicidal, and was moved to the psychiatric wing for several days. Human Rights Watch called upon Maryland to end the practice of detaining children in adult detention facilities, and ensure that conditions of detention for youth comply with federal and state law and international standards.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

The Thai government today initiated a campaign to round up and deport thousands of Burmese immigrants working in Thailand. The Thai government should also guarantee access for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to screen any Burmese migrant who presents a claim to be a refugee. """"Thailand's campaign will put the lives of many Burmese at risk,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. He noted that under customary international law, the Thai government has an obligation not to return anyone to a country where they have a well-founded fear of persecution. """"The Thai government must ensure that it identifies and provides protection to those with a fear of persecution in Burma, before deporting any illegal immigrants,"""" Saunders added. The Thai government has begun to round up and deport some 600,000 migrants living in Thailand. But massive human rights violations persist in Burma, exposing some returnees to the threat of serious persecution. Domestic pressure on the Thai government to deport immigrant labor has increased in the wake of the July 1997 economic crash and increase in unemployment. The Burmese army, under the direction of the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), continues to fight in areas adjacent to the Thai-Burma border against three main insurgent groups, the Karen National Union, Karenni National Progressive Party, and Shan State Army-South. The army commonly employs tactics of forced relocation of villagers, summary executions, and torture in its offensives. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Burma, Justice Rajsoomer Lallah, in a report released last week wrote that he was """"deeply concerned at the ongoing generalized human rights violations committed against the ethnic groups and other minorities in the eastern part of Myanmar [Burma]."""" The widespread use of forced labor in Burma is also a cause of refugee flows. Officials demand up to fifteen days a month of uncompensated labor for infrastructure construction, portering and army camp maintenance. In July 1999, the International Labour Organization (ILO) effectively banned the Burmese government from partaking in its activities or benefiting from ILO programs because of the government's failure to end the practice of forced labor. Human Rights Watch believes that members of the Shan ethnic minority are particularly at risk during the deportation sweeps. Fighting and forced relocation in central Shan State have driven as many as 100,000 villagers across the border since 1996. Unlike the Karen and Karenni ethnic minority groups, the Shan have no access to refugee camps and survive by seeking employment in the Thai labor market, particularly in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai provinces. A round-up of migrant workers in these northern provinces would result in many Shan being returned to a dangerous situation in Burma. Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR to press the Thai government to ensure protection and assistance for all Shan refugees in Thailand. UNHCR maintains a single officer at the Bangkok Immigration Detention Center to offer potential refugees the opportunity to identify themselves. Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR, in cooperation with Thai authorities, to assign officers in its three sub-offices on the Burmese border to identify and interview refugees and to designate staff to visit detention centers in provinces with large communities of Burmese workers, such as Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Ranong. In late 1998, Thailand granted UNHCR a permanent presence on the Thai border and greater access to more than over 100,000 refugees in camps there.

Rodolfo Herrera Luna (since deceased), then commander of the Army's Ninth Brigade.  Respectfully, we ask that you immediately take the necessary steps to discharge Hernando Medina Camacho and Justo Gil Zúñiga Labrador, the two officers responsible for the killing, and order their detention in a maximum security civilian prison. In addition, we urge your excellency to make a priority of a reform of the Disciplinary Code, to ensure that security force officers found guilty by the Internal Affairs agency (Procuraduría) of committing murders and other serious human rights violations be immediately removed from service. Following an exhaustive investigation, Internal Affairs concluded that Gen. Rodolfo Herrera Luna, since deceased, commander of the Ninth Brigade in Neiva, ordered the murder of Senator Cepeda, apparently in response to the homicide of Army General Carlos Julio Gil Colorado, which occurred in July of 1994 at the hands of the FARC. The day of Senator Cepeda's murder, Medina followed him on motorcycle while Zúñiga fired shots from another vehicle. Zúñiga used his nine-millimeter pistol to kill the Senator. To carry out the murder, Medina and Zúñiga had the support of Fidel and Carlos Castaño Gil, who had paid at least three professional assassins from Medellín to help carry out the attack. They arrived in Bogota in a Renault 9 """"Brio,"""" which they had stolen earlier. Later, investigators were able to identify the three individuals as Edison Jiménez (aka """"El Ñato""""), Fabio Usme (aka """"El Candelillo"""") and Pionono Franco Bedoya.

Evidence supporting Internal Affair's conclusions is abundant and gathered from diverse sources, including first-hand testimonies and ballistic tests. There is no doubt that the officers carried out this horrendous crime. However, it is also important to note that this is not the only crime for which they have been prosecuted. Medina's criminal record includes three murders, committed on March 27 and November 19 of 1993 and on January 9, 1994, when he was an active member of the Artillery Battalion No. 9 """"Tenerife"""" in Neiva.

During this period, he was assigned to Artillery Battalion No. 5 """"José Antonio Galán,"""" the Antiaircraft Battalion No. 2 """"Nueva Granada,"""" and the Colombia Battalion No. 3 """"Sinai."""" He was also suspended once by a military tribunal in 1980 and again by a civilian judge in 1995. There are several other infractions registered against him. In its first decision on the murder of Senator Cepeda, Internal Affairs concluded that both Medina and Zúñiga """"participated actively in committing the crime; that their conduct disregarded the murdered Senator's constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights; that their conduct caused irreparable damage not only for the family of the deceased but also for the State in general; that they have criminal records for similar acts; that their conduct tarnished the image of the institution of the military; that the posts they occupied during the time that the crime was committed imposed upon them the legal obligation to respect all constitutional and legal principles protecting residents of Colombia; and that their behavior has set a bad example for fellow officers in the Institution, for which this investigative office qualifies the crime committed as extremely serious."""" However, in a disputable interpretation of existing norms, Internal Affairs determined that murder is not registered as an administrative infraction within existing regulations. Therefore, the maximum punishment corresponding to their behavior is a severe reprimand, essentially a letter in their employment file. It is important to note that in its denial of the soldiers' appeal, Internal Affairs pointed out that a """"severe reprimand is embarrassingly insignificant, both within the national sphere and before the international community."""" The investigator called the officers """"horsemen of the apocalypse, capable of the most degraded human perversion."""" In a hearing before the Senate, the Attorney General pointed out that the guilt of General Herrera Luna and Carlos Castaño Gil as intellectual authors and instigators of the murder is completely clear; that Hernando Medina Camacho and Justo Gil Zúñiga Labrador, along with Castaño's assassins, carried out the crime; and that these facts had been proven to the Attorney General's investigators through first hand testimony and ample documentation. In other words, the evidence is unequivocal. A parallel investigation prepared by the Attorney General's office s currently awaiting a judge's decision. However, in spite their purported suspension, reliable sources indicate that the officers remain on active duty within the armed forces. Further, Medina apparently continues to direct an intelligence network. Both Medina and Zúñiga apparently move about freely in Bogota. Medina travels frequently to the city of Neiva where his relatives live. This situation has been reported repeatedly to Internal Affairs and the Attorney General, to no avail. Human Rights Watch applauded your August 12 pronouncement vowing to remove from service those security force officers found to have failed to carry out their duties and to have acted outside the law. You also emphasized that you have the constitutionally guaranteed power to remove from service any member of the Armed Forces. However, on August 13, the day after your pronouncement, Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramírez Acuña rejected the Cepeda family's request to cashier Medina and Zúñiga, a request supported by Senator Piedad Córdoba, a member of the Senate Human Rights Commission. Using misguided logic — and in clear contradiction to the vow you made the day before — Dr. Ramírez argued that """"it would be imprudent to investigate and punish a person for the same crime twice,"""" something that was never suggested by the Cepeda family. For all of the reasons above, we ask that you immediately remove from service the two officers in question. We would also like to inform you that one of the witnesses in the case, Elcías Muñoz Vargas, has said that his wife Marly Barreiro de Muñoz, and their daughter, Lina Yoana Muñoz Barreiro, age seven, were forcibly disappeared in 1997. Witnesses testified that the license plates of the car used to kidnap them matched those used by the Army's Ninth Brigade — to which both soldiers belonged at the time of the crime against Senator Cepeda — in this type of operation. We ask you to take immediate steps to investigate the crime and to guarantee the life and well-being of the family of Muñoz, who is currently serving a sentence in the Ibagué jail. Finally, I would like to reiterate the urgent need to reform the Disciplinary Code that governs the Armed Forces and has directly contributed to the reign of impunity in Colombia. It is enough to simply mention some of the cases in which military killers have been able to evade punishment for their criminal behavior — the case of the Navy Intelligence Network No. 7 in Barrancabermeja and the massacres of Los Uvos and Río Frío — to conclude that the only benefit this has brought Colombia is impunity and international condemnation. Your esteemed government should support a rapid reform to the Disciplinary Code that reflects the July 25, 1997 decision handed down by Colombia's Constitutional Court, which makes clear that violations of human rights can never be considered an act of service and must be punished by civilian courts. In cases where there is clear evidence of the participation of state agents in serious violations of human rights, such as extrajudicial execution, torture and forced """"disappearance,"""" those agents should be discharged immediately and handed over to the Attorney General's office for investigation and prosecution. Cases where military tribunals have already absolved those implicated in such crimes should be re-examined with all evidence included in the investigation for Internal Affairs and/or the Attorney General's office.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/11/02/evidence-war-crimes-chechnya","Evidence of War Crimes in Chechnya","Evidence of War Crimes in Chechnya","","11/02/1999","A Human Rights Watch team in Ingushetia has interviewed nine witnesses to Russia's October 21 attack on the Grozny Central Market. Their testimonies suggest the assault may have been a serious violation of the laws of war, and Human Rights Watch urges the Russian authorities to vigorously investigate the incident and publish their findings.  The testimonies also indicate that Chechen fighters may have situated a key command post within or adjacent to the market. This too would be a serious violation, as the Chechen forces are obliged to respect international law prohibiting use of the civilian population to shield military objects. Three large explosions ripped through the Chechen capital's downtown bazaar at approximately 5:00 p.m. on October 21, killing an estimated 140 people and wounding about 260, according to Chechen estimates. After initially denying any role, some Russian authorities acknowledged their involvement in the blast, but said they had struck legitimate Chechen military targets. The witness testimony, however, suggests that the Russian attack may have been illegal, as the use of powerful explosive devices in a congested civilian marketplace at an especially crowded time of day is likely to have been both indiscriminate and disproportionate. The Geneva Conventions and their protocols, to which Russia is a party, as well as the customary international law of war, emphasize the principle of civilian immunity. This body of law prohibits attacks - even when aimed at legitimate military targets - if they are indiscriminate or disproportionately harmful to civilians. Humanitarian law also requires precautions to protect the civilian population, such as effective advance warning. The witnesses were all interviewed separately and at length. They indicated there may have been legitimate military targets in the market. One forty-year-old woman said she heard that a number of Chechen fighters had been killed and wounded in the blast, and that the injured combatants had been sent to the nearby Urus-Martan hospital. Another 35-year-old woman wounded in the attack told Human Rights Watch that Chechen military commander Shamil Basayev had his headquarters in a corner of the market near a group of stalls selling automatic weapons, pistols and ammunition. However, neither the importance of Basayev's headquarters, nor the possibility of arms merchants in the bazaar, justifies the tremendous amount of force used against the market. Witnesses said that the central market was thronged by hundreds of shoppers at the time of the attack. The shopping arcade, a narrow, informal bazaar stretching for some 400 yards along the trolley tracks in central Grozny, runs perpendicular to Prospekt Svobody street, the capital's central thoroughfare. """"You can buy everything you need there,"""" said Zalina Amirkhanova, a 17-year-old nursing student injured in the blast. """"Vendors sell anything from second-hand clothes to vegetables, meat, flowers, eggs, jewelry, and medicine."""" Her upper right arm was seriously wounded. Customers included Chechens as well as ethnic Russians and Ingush. """"It was the main place to buy produce and household goods,"""" explained Bella Titiyeva, a 27-year-old pharmacist. """"I shopped there almost every day."""" The bazaar included dozens of small stalls jammed against one another. Immediately before the attack, the bazaar was """"so packed that I had to almost push my way through,"""" recalled Shamil, a 42-year-old math teacher whose right foot was injured. The market was particularly crowded at the time of the blast, as it was filled with shoppers on their way home from work. The first explosion hit a building about fifty yards northeast of the central bazaar. Most of the marketplace deaths came from the second and third explosions, however, which occurred within 100 yards of each other in the central bazaar area. The second explosion hit a building adjacent to a Number 7 bus, which was caught in traffic at the corner of Prospekt Svobody and Mira Streets. """"I saw the building explode and then glass flew everywhere,"""" recalled a 63-year-old female bus passenger. """"I then looked down and thought, 'Where is my arm?'"""" Part of her right arm was blown off. As she crawled off the ruined bus, the witness saw the bodies of two children who were """"less than 10 years old,"""" lying dead on the pavement. The second blast caught Bella Titiyeva in the center of the market, """"near the flowers and confectionery stalls,"""" while she was shopping for toiletries with a friend. """"There were bodies everywhere,"""" she recalled; her lower leg was shattered by the blast, and her calf muscle was shredded. Her mother recalled that """"it was hard to get to my daughter, because there were so many bodies strewn around."""" Another 34-year-old woman, wounded in her right leg, discovered her 16-year-old son's body lying between two stalls. She said the top of his head had been blown off. Many of the blasts' victims were brought to the central Grozny hospital, where doctors operated by candlelight. """"The first floor was packed with wounded and dead people,"""" recalled one 25-year-old man who brought his brother to the hospital. """"They were putting them on the balconies, the floors, everywhere."""" Some of the wounded were evacuated across the Ingush border that same night. Others, however, were taken across 24 or 48 hours later, and therefore faced lengthy delays by Russian troops attempting to seal the border. """"I waited with my daughter in an ambulance for 24 hours at the Russian checkpoint,"""" Bella Titiyeva's mother recalled. """"They wouldn't let us through, even though they could see she needed urgent attention."""" According to Ingushetia hospital officials, the medical condition of some blast victims deteriorated as a result of the border delays. Although there is some evidence that there may have been legitimate military targets located near or within the Grozny bazaar, the size and extent of the blasts, combined with the large number of noncombatants in the immediate vicinity, strongly suggests that the Russian attack was grossly disproportionate. If Chechen commander Shamil Basayev did indeed situate his headquarters within the Grozny market, that too would be a serious abuse of international law. Although Chechen fighters are not parties to the Geneva Conventions, as individuals within the territory of a state party [Russia], they are bound to respect the basic precept of civilian immunity. Human Rights Watch calls upon Chechen commanders to immediately redeploy their troops, headquarters, and weapons storage facilities out of populated areas.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","International Justice"

The poem adapted this verse from the story of Yousef (Joseph) in the Koran: """"O my father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage."""" The highest Sunni Muslim religious authority in Lebanon, Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhamed Rashid Qabbani, has maintained repeatedly that Khalifa is guilty of blasphemy for singing a verse from the Koran. Sheikh Qabbani said on October 21: """"There is a limit to freedom of expression. One limit is that it should not infringe on people's religious beliefs."""" Mahmoud Darwish, whose poem Khalifa set to music, criticized the legal proceedings in an interview with the Lebanese daily newspaper al-Diyar on October 10. """"Fundamentalism is in the process of stifling culture and creation in the Arab world,"""" he said. """"I say it is shameful. I am ashamed. We should all be ashamed. If Marcel Khalifa is found guilty, it will be an insult to culture."""" Human Rights Watch said today that Khalifa's recordings and performances are protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty to which Lebanon is a state party. Article 19 of the ICCPR grants to everyone the right to freedom of expression. It further states that """"this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice."""" As a state party to the ICCPR, Lebanon is obligated to respect and ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction enjoy the right to freedom of expression.

The court decision, issued on October 29, 1999, rejected the NLD's claim that its activities had been """"continuously disrupted, prevented and destroyed"""" and that hundreds of its members had been illegally detained. Supreme Court judge Tin Aung Aye declared the case invalid and dismissed it due to lack of evidence. """"There is no rule of law in Burma,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division.""""There is, in fact, a great deal of evidence that the government is harassing NLD party members."""" The abuse of power lawsuit was filed on December 31, 1998. It named as defendants Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, the powerful director-general of the National Bureau of Intelligence and one of the top leaders of the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC); Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing; Information Minister Major-General Kyi Aung; Election Commission Chairman Ba Htay and some twenty-five other officials. The Burmese judiciary remains firmly under the control of the military government, which took power in a 1988 coup. This was the first time that the Burmese courts heard a case submitted by the NLD. The NLD said it plans to resubmit the complaint. Following the NLD's announcement in August 1998 that it would convene a parallel parliamentary body, the ruling SPDC initiated a repressive campaign, detaining, intimidating, and publicly harassing NLD politicians and party loyalists in an effort to force their resignations. Currently some forty elected parliamentarians remain under detention, and the government press has reported that thousands of NLD members have resigned their membership in the party. The NLD won more than eighty percent of the vote in a popular election in May 1990, but the military government dismissed the election results, extending its hold on state power. """"The United Nations has repeatedly condemned Burma's campaign against the NLD,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"By dismissing this lawsuit, the SPDC is signaling its determination to ignore international public opinion."""" In October 1998, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson expressed concern over """"the intensification of repression against Myanmar's [Burma's] political opposition.""""

On a radio interview on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin stated, """"Everything that concerns the bombing of peaceful residents is the ill-intended propaganda of terrorists."""" """"That is simply not true,"""" stated Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Civilians are clearly getting killed in this conflict."""" In recent weeks, the media have reported on unconfirmed civilian casualties that resulted from Russian air raids throughout Chechnya. In thorough, detailed interviews, Human Rights Watch researchers have been able to document civilian casualties in at least two such raids. In one incident on October 3, Russian bombers attacked Urus-Martan, a mid-sized town fifteen miles south of Grozny, killing twenty-seven civilians. In a second attack, Russian warplanes killed seven noncombatants and wounded twenty in an attack on the northeastern Grozny suburb, Staraya Sunzha. While in both cases Human Rights Watch was unable to determine whether the attacks were violations of humanitarian law, the in-depth interviews confirmed what Russian officials have steadfastly denied: that civilian casualties are mounting in Chechnya. Not all civilian casualties constitute violations of humanitarian law. For the latter, military planners must have either targeted civilians, fired indiscriminately, or failed to apply the principle of proportionality in planning and executing attacks. Vakha Guchigov, a forty-five-year-old businessman who witnessed the Usus -Martan raid, told Human Rights Watch that five pairs of Russian warplanes attacked the town at 5:30 p.m., firing multiple air-to-surface missiles. The plane approached from the northwest, circled the town several times, and then attacked from the northeast. One missile struck a home bordering the central square, killing a middle-aged male. Additional missiles destroyed two residences, owned by the Kerimov family on Kalanchakskaya Street, at the extreme southern edge of town. Nine person were killed, including Hasan Kerimov, 40; his wife, 33; their infant son; Ablan Kerimov, 34; his wife, 30; a male relative, 27; a female relative, 22; a young girl under ten years of age; and a 40 year-old female member of the Gaitayev family. The witness told Human Rights Watch that he buried the nine victims in hastily dug communal graves in the southern part of town. A further 17 persons died elsewhere in the attack, including at least two women. The total death toll from the raid was 27. The Russian planes may have been aiming at a guerilla compound located about a mile and a half southeast of the central square and one mile east of the Kerimov residences. The compound has several hundred anti-Russian fighters, but was situated 300 yards to the southeast of the Urus-Martan town border. In peacetime, some 60,000 people live in Urus-Martan, but that number had swelled to 100,00 at the time of the attack. The second raid was launched against targets in Staraya Sunzha, a northeastern Grozny suburb, home to some 8,600 residents, on September 26. Two witnesses told Human Rights Watch that a pair of Russian warplanes circled the area and then fired air-to surface missiles at 10:30 a.m. The projectiles destroyed a private home on Batakuyeva Street, another home on Okruzhnaya Street, and Secondary School no. 1, located between Khan-Pasha Nuradilova and Avtobusnaya street. Seven members of the Umkhayev and Temirsultanov family were killed, including a 50 year-old male, a 60 year-old female; a 30 year-old female; and four children. The attack on Secondary School no. 1 wounded some twenty students, some seriously. Human Rights Watch was unable to determine the warplanes' intended targets.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

According to government and U.N. officials, some 200,000 Chechens have already fled to Ingushetia, a small republic in Russia lying to the west of Chechnya. Escape is proving to be a costly endeavor, however, as each stage of the trip requires a substantial cash payment. Although the average monthly income in Grozny, the Chechen capital, was some 250 rubles (U.S. $10), before the war, escape to neighboring Ingushetia can cost that much for each displaced person. The total cost for an extended family seeking to flee the fighting can reach thousands of rubles. """"Everyone is selling their jewelry, everything they have, to get out ,"""" one middle-aged woman reported. """"If you don't have anything to sell, you can't leave.""""

There are currently 141 Lebanese detained in Khiam without charge, according to the Beirut-based Follow-Up Committee for the Support of Lebanese Detainees in Israeli Prisons. The Lebanese most recently detained in Khiam include Cosette Ibrahim, a 25-year-old journalist who was taken into custody in early September 1999 while visiting her parents in the village of Rmeish in the occupied zone.  The longest-held detainee is Suleiman Ramadan, who has been imprisoned without charge since September 1985. Those released from long years in Khiam often require medical care, and physical and psychological rehabilitation. Israel for years has maintained that the prison is administered by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), the Lebanese militia that Israel finances and arms and which serves as its auxiliary in occupied south Lebanon.

The vital work of these aid agencies, working to alleviate acute shortages of food and medicine affecting tens of thousands of civilians, has now effectively ground to a halt. There are also continued reports of rape committed by rebel soldiers during the Makeni attack and after the October 4 hijacking of a government bus near Magbondo village. Human Rights Watch also called on the U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to publicly denouce the rebel actions and bring all possible pressure to bear on Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma to halt rebel atrocities. Secretary Albright visited Sierra Leone on October 17 and met with rebel and government leaders.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/10/27/letter-us-president-clinton-regarding-human-rights-concerns-nigeria","Letter to US President Clinton Regarding Human Rights Concerns in Nigeria","Letter to U.S. President Clinton Regarding Human Rights Concerns in Nigeria","","10/27/1999","Dear President Clinton:    Human Rights Watch welcomes the attention that your administration has focused on Africa, symbolized by your historic visit last year, Secretary Albright's most recent trip last week, and your meeting with Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo tomorrow. Nigeria's transition offers real hope that respect for human rights will contribute to stability and economic progress, and therefore we would like to take the opportunity of your meeting with President Obasanjo to raise some concerns about human rights in that country.   The situation in Nigeria has substantially improved over the last year, and the inauguration of President Obasanjo on May 29 brings hope that the long series of military governments in Nigeria may be over. Following the relaxation of repression by President Abubakar, President Obasanjo has himself taken significant steps to improve respect for human rights. Nevertheless, there are huge areas of law and practice that still need reform. In particular, we would like to highlight and ask that you raise the following issues with him during his visit.    Investigation of Past Human Rights Violations     Immediately after he became head of state, President Obasanjo announced the appointment of a seven-member commission chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, to investigate """"mysterious deaths"""" and assassinations and other human rights abuses under the military governments in office since 1984 and to make recommendations to redress past injustices and to prevent future violations. Recently, the commission's mandate was extended back to 1966, the date of the first military coup, and will therefore take in the events of the Biafran war. The commission has been widely welcomed by human rights groups in Nigeria, though it is not yet clear exactly what mandate, powers, or budget it will have, or the date by which it will have to complete its investigation and present a report.    Human Rights Watch also welcomes the appointment of this commission and believes that it has the potential to play an important role in the establishment of a truly new beginning in Nigeria - in the same way that the truth commissions in South Africa or Latin American countries have done. However, this potential will only be fulfilled if the commission is given sufficient powers, political backing and funding to enable it to carry out an independent and effective investigation, subpoena witnesses, and make recommendations, including for prosecutions where appropriate. The U.S. government should support this process. In particular, we request that you emphasize the importance for the commission to be fully independent in its operations. While, as an official body, a commission of this type is usually government-funded, and this funding should be adequate to fund staff to investigate the cases brought before it, to hold public hearings where appropriate, and to prepare a comprehensive report. The commission should have full control over its own budget, and the freedom to raise funds from other sources. In addition, the commission should be free to accept assistance from national and international civil society groups, such as human rights organizations and church structures, in conducting their investigations and to facilitate participation by victims or witnesses who do not have the resources to hire their own representatives.    The Situation in the Niger Delta   The crisis in the oil producing regions is one of the most pressing issues for the new government of Nigeria and has the greatest potential to lead to a serious deterioration in respect for human rights. The Niger Delta has for some years been the site of major confrontations between the people who live there and the Nigerian government's security forces, resulting in extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions, and draconian restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. These violations of civil and political rights, which reached a climax during the """"Ogoni crisis"""" of 1993 to 1996, have been committed principally in response to protests about the activities of the multinational companies that extract Nigeria's oil and the lack of local accountability for the way in which the oil revenue is used by the Nigerian government.    Since the relaxation in repression following the death of General Abacha, and in the context of the greater competition within the political environment encouraged by the elections and the installation of a civilian government, there has been a surge in demands for the government to improve the position of the different groups living in the oil producing areas. In addition there has been an increase in criminal acts such as kidnappings of oil company staff in hope of ransom payments, and violence among neighboring ethnic groups over matters such as the location of local government headquarters, crucial in the distribution of oil resources.   In response, large numbers of soldiers and paramilitary Mobile Police have been deployed across the delta. Although there is a clear need for law and order to be reestablished in those parts of the delta where the violence between neighboring ethnic groups has been worst, the security forces have both failed to protect civilians from violence in many cases, and have also themselves carried out serious and widespread violations of human rights. Security force action has often been indiscriminate, or targeted at those who have not committed any crime but have protested oil production in accordance with their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association.    President Obasanjo visited the delta area in June 1999 and held discussions with local leaders. He traveled again to the delta to visit the new liquefied natural gas terminal Bonny, on the Atlantic Coast, following September demonstrations there which temporarily halted exports. He has promised to bring greater development to the delta, and introduced to the National Assembly a bill to establish a Niger Delta Development Commission. Most leaders of the ethnic groups based in the Niger Delta, however, have rejected the bill since it does not address their concerns surrounding revenue allocation and resource control and appears likely to duplicate similar corruption-ridden bodies created by previous administrations.    The U.S. should urge the Nigerian government, among other steps, to appoint a judicial enquiry to investigate ongoing human rights violations in the delta, and to discipline or prosecute those responsible and compensate the victims. The Oputa commission that is investigating past abuses generally has already received submissions relating to thousands of cases from Ogoniland. The government should take steps to replace soldiers carrying out policing duties in the Niger Delta area and elsewhere with regular police with training in public order policing and ensure that those police deployed have been vetted to exclude abusive officers. The government should institute an immediate, inclusive and transparent process of negotiation with freely chosen representatives of the peoples living in the Niger Delta to resolve the issues surrounding the production of oil.    Reform of the Constitution     The constitution that came into force in Nigeria on May 29 was promulgated by General Abubakar only three weeks before the new government was inaugurated, following an unrepresentative drafting process that took place virtually without consultation with the Nigerian people. The 1999 constitution was finalized by a panel appointed by General Abubakar and adopted by the military Provisional Ruling Council. There is a consensus among Nigerian civil society organizations that the process by which the constitution was adopted was illegitimate and that the arrangements in relation to a number of crucial areas, including human rights and the rule of law, the structure of the Nigerian federation and the system for revenue allocation and resource management, are not acceptable. The constitution's content raises a number of human rights concerns.    On September 9, the National Assembly announced the initiation of a review of the 1999 constitution. The Senate passed a motion for the Senate committee on the judiciary to liaise with the House of Representatives and state legislatures for this purpose. Civil society organizations are responding with an initiative to coordinate input to the process and promote popular participation.    In many ways the lack of a legitimate constitution is the fundamental problem facing Nigeria, with knock-on effects on good governance, corruption, economic policy, as well as human rights and the rule of law. We urge you to emphasize to President Obasanjo the importance of ensuring that the constitutional review process is inclusive and transparent so that it can succeed in drafting a new constitution which will be legitimate in the eyes of all Nigerians. The U.S. government should offer financial and technical assistance, as well as diplomatic support, for this process.    Thank you for your attention to these important matters.    Sincerely,    Peter Takirambudde Executive Director, Africa Division Human Rights Watch   cc:  Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, Department of State  Susan Rice, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs  Gayle Smith, Senior Director for African Affairs, National Security Council  Harold Koh, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Eric Schwartz, Senior Director for Multilateral and Humanitarian Affairs, National Security Council  Rev.

Following the Belgrade bombing, the Administration was preoccupied with getting bilateral relations back on track, largely putting human rights concerns on the back burner. For its part, the Chinese government suspended its bilateral human rights dialogue with the U.S., put off a planned visit by the German chancellor until November, and delayed talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). International protests against the banning of Falun Gong and the crackdown on activists prior to the June 4 and October 1 anniversaries were mild or nonexistent.  U.S. Human Rights Policy: Recommendations The Clinton Administration had no clear strategy to follow up the president's visit to China. It is crucial that the Administration begin now to lay the groundwork for a sustained multilateral effort on China at next spring's U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Only with U.S. leadership -- from both the White House and the State Department -- can a serious campaign be launched to hold China accountable in the highest U.N. forum designed to protect and promote human rights. We also hope the new U.S. ambassador to the People's Republic of China will place a much higher priority on human rights, not only by pressing China to take the steps outlined below, but also by increasing regular monitoring of human rights abuses by embassy and consulate staff; by energetically seeking access by diplomatic personnel and the media to trials, such as the trials of Falun Gong members that have recently begun and the trials of pro-democracy activists; and by working with other embassies to develop coordinated strategies on key human rights issues. We urge the Administration to press China to take practical, concrete steps to improve human rights in China and Tibet including the following: -- Getting agreement to release, amnesty or review the convictions of approximately 2000 persons still imprisoned on charged of """"counterrevolution."""" These offenses were formally abolished as a crime in 1997, but the Chinese government has stated that this will have no effect on those already convicted. They include numerous nuns and monks from Tibet, labor rights activists and individuals imprisoned in connection with the June 1989 crackdown. --Initiation of a process to end the system of re-education through labor, which leads to the arbitrary detention of thousands of Chinese citizens each year, without charge or trial. --Obtaining verifiable information on the current status and whereabouts of the Panchen Lama, Gendun Choeki Nyima, the child chosen by the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the reincarnation of an important Tibetan religious figure.  -- Getting agreement on unrestricted access to Tibet and Xinjiang by the international press, human rights and humanitarian organizations. --Securing a commitment to implement safeguards on freedom of association and labor rights. The International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and Civil and Political Rights both contain important guarantees on freedom of religion, association, assembly and expression.  WTO and Codes of Conduct In late November, the World Trade Organization will hold its ministerial conference in Seattle, and talks with the U.S. and other governments on China's potential entry into the WTO have recently resumed. We believe that bringing China into the WTO on commercially acceptable terms could help human rights and strengthen the rule of law over the long term. As a member of the WTO, China would face increasing demands -- internally and externally -- for greater transparency, an independent judiciary, and protection of worker rights. However, the Administration should not once again make the mistake of overstating the benefits of its trade policy. The President has stated that he would push for permanent NTR (Normal Trade Relations) status for China as part of a WTO package, thus doing away with the annual NTR renewal process. In return for permanent NTR -- something China has lobbied for over several years -- we believe the Congress should insist on reciprocal gestures on human rights by China. For example, within one year of getting permanent NTR, China should ratify either or both of the two UN covenants, and take some of the other concrete steps outlined above. We hope the Administration will join the Congress in supporting limited, realistic but meaningful human rights conditions on permanent NTR.  We would also strongly support legislation on codes of conduct for U.S. companies operating in China, along the lines of bills previously introduced in both the House and Senate. Such legislation would express the sense of Congress that U.S. companies doing business in China should adopt certain principles to prohibit the use of forced labor, prohibit a police or military presence in the workplace, protect workers' rights of free association, assembly and religion, discourage compulsory political indoctrination, and promote freedom of expression by workers including their freedom to seek and receive information of all kinds through any media -- in writing, orally, or through the Internet. Legislation outlining principles for U.S. companies should contain a registration and reporting procedure, and an annual report to Congress on the level of adherence to the principles by U.S. companies. Human Rights Developments in China, Tibet, Hong Kong Controls on basic freedoms were tightened during the past year, in part because of Chinese authorities' desire to ensure stability on several sensitive dates. These included the fortieth anniversary of the March 10, 1959, Tibetan uprising, the tenth anniversary of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the PRC on October 1, 1949.  Trials of dissidents—and there were many—were neither fair nor open. Gao Yu, a prominent journalist accused of leaking state secrets, was released from prison early, but like many other released prisoners, continued to face a variety of restrictions.  A prolonged economic slump coupled with illegal and excessive fees and taxes fueled unrest and heightened the government's concerns with stability. On the political front, President Jiang Zemin's determination to bolster the Chinese Communist Party, to placate hardliners, and to secure his own place in history contributed to heightened intolerance of any organization openly critical of the Party's platform or attempting to function outside Party control. Individuals and groups suspected of ties to """"hostile"""" foreign organizations and those disseminating sensitive political information overseas were particularly targeted. State control of religious affairs in Tibet intensified. Dozens of judicial executions were reported from Xinjiang, where some ethnic Uighur groups were advocating a separate state; other alleged """"splittists"""" were sentenced to long prison terms. Judicial independence and the rule of law in the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong were seriously undermined when the SAR government asked Beijing to interpret a ruling by the SAR's highest court.  On the positive side, legal reform efforts continued, although the legal system remained highly politicized. Supreme Court President Xiao Yang announced in March that in the interests of transparency, trials would be open and verdicts quickly made public, except for cases involving state secrets. In April, he announced plans to curb government interference with the legal process. Chinese judicial and legal experts continued to meet with their counterparts in many countries in an effort to further the reform process. On November 23, 1998, former Premier Li Peng announced that China would not tolerate any political system that would """"negate the leadership of the Communist Party."""" A month later, three organizers of the opposition China Democracy Party (CDP) received heavy sentences. Veteran dissident Xu Wenli in Beijing, Qin Yongmin in Hubei province, and Wang Youcai in Zhejiang were sentenced to thirteen, twelve, and eleven years in prison respectively on charges of subversion. Other CDP members were also tried. During the first week of August alone, Zha Jianguo and Gao Hongming received nine- and eight-year terms in Beijing, and She Wanbao and Liu Xianbin received twelve and thirteen years respectively from courts in Sichuan. The following week, two Shanghai CDP members, Cai Guihua and Han Lifa, instead of being released on schedule, had their terms extended. Some thirty CDP members were still in custody as of mid-October, and the crackdown on the CDP had extended to some twenty provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Legal authorities also squashed the China Development Union (CDU), a nongovernmental organization committed to environmental and political reform. In February, its leader, Peng Ming, was detained for fifteen days on a charge of soliciting prostitution. Instead of being released, he was then administratively sentenced to an additional term of eighteen months. Labor and peasant activists also received long sentences. Unrest in Hunan province resulted in sentences of up to six years for nine peasants who protested the imposition of exorbitant taxes; the arrest of Liao Shihua for organizing workers to demand an end to pervasive corruption in the province; and two-year terms for six farmers who alleged that local elections had been rigged. Throughout the year, China repeatedly demonstrated its determination to prevent contacts between mainland and overseas dissidents and to obstruct information flows. On January 20 the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate Court announced a two-year sentence for computer entrepreneur Lin Hai for passing some 30,000 e-mail addresses to VIP Reference, an overseas dissident publication. Fang Jue, a former economic planning official in Fujian province, whose essay on democratic reform was published abroad in 1998, was sentenced to a four-year prison term in June 1999 on what appeared to be spurious fraud charges. In March, a district court sentenced Gao Shaokun, a retired police officer, to a two-year term after he told the foreign press about a peasant protest; on May 11 a Beijing court sentenced Liu Xianli to a four-year term for his attempts to publish a work about well-known Chinese dissidents. Song Yongyi, a Dickinson College (Pennsylvania) researcher, was detained in August when he returned to China on a Chinese passport to continue his research on the Cultural Revolution. Chinese authorities were clearly concerned about increasing use of the Internet. New regulations in January required bars and cafes with Internet access to register and inform the police about their business operations and customers. In May the Ministry of State Security installed monitoring devices on Internet service providers capable of tracking individual e-mail accounts. Special computer task forces began round-the-clock checks on bulletin boards. In January one of those bulletin boards, """"Everything Under the Sun,"""" was ordered closed for posting messages critical of the government. In February Chinese authorities shut down the """"New Wave Network,"""" a popular bulletin board that featured political discussion. In September police detained Qi Yanchen, a former China Development Union member and a member of the China Democracy Party, whose electronic magazine Consultations pushed the CDU agenda. In early September, after overseas dissidents hacked into the website of the official newspaper, People's Daily, a police circular called for a crackdown on all anti-Party and government articles on the Internet. The government also tightened controls on publishing and the print media. On January 1 new regulations required shippers of printed material to obtain government permits. President Jiang Zemin personally ordered senior officials to prevent the media from undermining the fiftieth anniversary celebration. His complaints about the number of publications in circulation resulted in a decision to stop issuing any publication permits at least through June. In September the government decreed that local newspapers and magazines had to be placed under Party management by October 30 or face closure, and it was estimated that some 20,000 publications would be closed. In September Chinese authorities banned newsstand sales of special editions of Time, Asiaweek, and Newsweek covering fifty years of Communist Party rule. Censorship even affected computer games and survey research, with authorities confiscating some 10,000 games that featured Taiwan repelling a mainland invasion. Restraints on religion and belief increased significantly during the year. On April 25, ten thousand members of Falung Gong (also known as Falun Dafa)surrounded Zhongnanhai, the Beijing compound housing China's top leaders. The peaceful, silent demonstration was to protest a newspaper article disparaging Falun Gong. The size of the demonstration clearly shocked the government, and while authorities took no immediate action, they began a systematic crackdown three months later. On July 22the Ministry of Civil Affairs labeled Falun Gong an illegal organization and accused it of spreading """"superstition"""" and """"endangering social stability."""" It banned public and private practice and distribution of the organization's literature. Police detained thousands of practitioners for reeducation and began to confiscate and destroy over one million books. A week later, the government issued an arrest warrant for Li Hongzhi, the group's leader, who had been living in the U.S. The government put the number of practitioners at two million; other estimates run as high as seventy million. Alarmed at the number of party members involved, the party leadership mounted a full-scale internal """"rectification,"""" using the opportunity to emphasize the value of Marxism and reinvigorate President Jiang's """"three stresses"""" campaign to strengthen theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct among Party members. As of October at least three top Falun Gong leaders, Wang Zhiwen, Li Chang and Ji Liuwu, were still in custody; and ten managers of printing presses in Sichuan and Guangxi were being held for printing Falun Gong materials. The Ministry of Justice announced that any lawyer wishing to represent a Falun Gong follower must obtain government permission.  Police detained members of at least three other sects, the Men Tu Hui or Disciples, Dongfang Shandian or Eastern Lightning, and a group known as God's Religion. The government continued its longstanding campaign to force Catholic congregations to register with the Bureau of Religious Affairs. The campaign, centered in parts of Zhejiang and Hebei provinces with large Catholic populations, was marked by detentions, disappearances, ill-treatment, fines, and harassment. A series of arrests in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, that continued into September, forced some clergy into hiding. In one still unexplained incident, Father Yan Weiping, from Hebei, was found dead on a Beijing street on May 13. He had been detained that same day while saying Mass. In a crackdown in southern Henan province, several prominent house church leaders were briefly detained. The raid followed an earlier one in central Henan on January 24 when pastor Chu Chang'en and forty-five others were detained. In May, three students in China's most prestigious Protestant seminary were expelled after protesting the government's control of religious affairs. Free assembly fared poorly during the year. Police in several cities prevented those wishing to publicly commemorate the tenth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown from laying wreaths or visiting cemeteries. Jiang Qisheng, a student leaders in 1989, was formally arrested for calling on people to remember the crackdown with a candlelight vigil.  In a move to ensure order before the October 1 celebration, the Beijing city government banned all public gatherings after July 1. Police detained or expelled those without papers, legal residence permits or permanent incomes. They targeted migrants, beggars, hawkers, food vendors, the homeless, the unemployed, the mentally ill, prostitutes, and other """"undesirables."""" On September 6 the Public Security Bureau notified hostels, hotels, boarding houses, and private citizens that they would be penalized for housing illegal migrants. Dissidents were under heavy surveillance, their movements restricted, and their phone lines cut. Any non-resident wishing to enter Beijing needed a detailed letter of introduction.  The death penalty continued in use, and mass executions were common. On September 27 the Guangdong Supreme People's Court declared it would hold fifty-seven public rallies to announce 818 sentences. Two hundred and thirty-eight prisoners were scheduled to be executed before October 1. Executions also took place in Changsha, Hunan province and Chongqing, a city formerly part of Sichuan province. Tibet At the beginning of the year, authorities announced a three-year campaign to free rural Tibetans from the """"negative influence of religion,"""" and to work against the Dalai Lama's """"splittist"""" struggle. They continued to deny access to Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the ten-year-old boy recognized by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism. No one has seen the child or members of his family since 1995 when the Chinese government recognized another boy, Gyaltsen Norbu, as the reincarnation. On June 17, that boy arrived in Tibet for the first time. In response to a World Bank proposal to resettle some 58,000 Han Chinese and Hui Muslims in a predominately Tibetan and Mongolian area in Qinghai province, an Australian, Gabriel Lafitte, an American, Daja Meston, and their Tibetan translator, Tsering Dorje, traveled to the area to assess for themselves the feelings of residents in the resettlement region. State security forces detained all three on August 15 but released them within two weeks. Lafitte and Meston, who was severely injured in an escape attempt, were permitted to leave after confessing to wrongdoing. During the year, security forces detained Tibetans who openly advocated independence. On March 10, the fortieth anniversary of an abortive uprising against China, two Tibetan monks, Phuntsok Legmon and Namdol, demonstrated in Barkor Square in Lhasa. On July 9 they reportedly received three- and four-year sentences respectively, a report that Tibetan officials have denied. In a preemptive move, some eighty people were detained beforeMarch 10. Monks from major monasteries could not enter the city, and the Jokhang, the most religious site in Tibet, was closed for """"cleaning."""" Prison conditions in Tibet remained substandard. In February the official Chinese news agency acknowledged that """"quasi-military"""" training for staff and prisoners had been carried out in Drapchi prison """"to improve police officers' managerial abilities and enhance prisoners' discipline and awareness of the law."""" The use of torture continued, sometimes resulting in death. Legshe Tsoglam, a Nalanda monk who resisted reeducation, died in April, several days after his release from Gutsa Detention Center. A Ganden monk, Ngawang Jinpa, died two months after serving his full four-year term, and Norbu, also from Nalanda, died almost three years after severe prison beatings damaged his kidneys. All three were in their early twenties. Several monks, arrested in 1998 for putting photos of the Dalai Lama on the main altar in Kirti monastery in Sichuan Province, were sentenced in July and August 1999. Ngawang Sangdrol, a twenty-three-year-old nun, severely beaten after a protest in Drapchi prison in May 1998, had her original three-year sentence extended for the third time for a total of twenty-one years.  Xinjiang Local authorities, claiming that """"splittist"""" elements in the region were using terrorist tactics, ordered intensified efforts to maintain stability in the run-up to the October 1 anniversary celebrations. Executions of so-called """"splittists"""" were commonplace, as were long prison sentences and public sentencing rallies. In January, a court official in Ili prefecture, the scene of massive demonstrations and rioting in 1997, confirmed that twenty-nine people, all but two of them ethnic Uighurs, had been given the death penalty. In July a court in Nonshishi sentenced another eighteen men to terms ranging from ten to fifteen years for, among other things, allegedly destroying the Party's religious policy. In an apparent attempt to decrease the flow of information overseas, public security officers in Urumqi, the capital, seized Rebiya Kadeer, a prominent Uighur businesswoman, on August 11 as she was on her way to meet a visiting American. She was later charged with trying to transmit information across borders. Rebiya Kadeer's husband, a U.S. resident, publicly advocates independence and appears regularly on Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. Rebiya, her son, Ablikim Abdyirim, and her secretary, Kahriman Abdukirim, remained in prison as of October. Hong Kong This year China took several steps to curtail Hong Kong's autonomy and the rule of law. The independence of the courts in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was placed in jeopardy after Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa invited Beijing to intervene in a decision of the highest court in Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal. Tung campaigned against the court's decision on right of abode in Hong Kong that would have allowed many more mainland Chinese to reside in the S.A.R. (How many more was a matter of intense debate.) Fearing a flood of Chinese immigrants, on May 18 Tung invited the Standing Committee of China's People's National Congress, as the ultimate authority under Hong Kong's constitution, the Basic Law, to overturn the ruling. Leading judges and lawyers questioned the political decision of the Chief Executive to invite Beijing to intervene. The Standing Committee effectively reversed the Court of Final Appeal's decision.  Municipal councils, the middle tier of elected office in Hong Kong, were abolished by Tung this year, in a transparent effort to weaken the influence of pro-democracy political parties in Hong Kong. Chinese officials barred entry to pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmakers. On September 12, Margaret Ng (who was a witness before this Committee last July) was prevented from attending a seminar on China's constitution. China also interfered with requests for travel to Hong Kong, refusing to consider a papal visit because the Vatican and Taiwan maintain diplomatic relations. A senior official from Taiwan was prevented from attending an academic conference at the University of Hong Kong.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/10/27/torture-khiam-prison-responsibility-and-accountability","Torture in Khiam Prison- Responsibility and Accountability","Torture in Khiam Prison: Responsibility and Accountability","","10/27/1999","October 28 marks the Day for the Closure of Khiam Prison in Israeli-occupied south Lebanon. Disclosures in an affidavit that the Israeli ministry of defense submitted last month to Israel's High Court of Justice confirm what Lebanese and international campaigners to stop torture at this prison have said for years -- Israeli intelligence agents have direct involvement with Lebanese interrogators at Khiam. The defense ministry's admissions must be incorporated into regional and international efforts to pressure Israel to close Khiam and hold accountable Lebanese and Israelis responsible for systematic acts of torture that have occurred there over the past two decades. The affidavit was written by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier General Dan Halutz, who is in charge of the IDF's operations in the part of south Lebanon that Israel calls its """"security zone."""" It was submitted after an order of the high court was issued in connection with a lawsuit filed against the defense ministry in April 1999. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Center for the Defense of the Individual (HaMoked, in Hebrew) filed the suit on behalf of four Lebanese detained in Khiam. These two Israeli human rights groups petitioned the court for the immediate release of the four prisoners, as well as permission to meet with them in Khiam and examine conditions of detention there. The carefully worded affidavit attempts to distance Israel from direct legal responsibility for crimes committed at Khiam, describing the prison in the present tense only, with no mention of Israel's role there in past years. It states that """"the interrogators, the jailers, and all of the staff of the facility are Lebanese."""" It mentions repeatedly that the prison is administered, maintained, and guarded by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's surrogate Lebanese militia that it finances and arms. It also notes that the SLA has a """"common hierarchic military structure"""" and is headed by Lebanese commander General Antoine Lahd. The affidavit concedes that Israel """"has influence over the SLA,"""" even to the extent of forcing suspension of visits of the International Committee of the Red Cross to the prison, but maintains that matters concerning Khiam's detainees are """"under the responsibility and discretion of the SLA"""" and """"not within the authority"""" of the Israeli defense ministry. Even if this is the official line, Israel is obligated as a state party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to investigate Gen. Lahd, current and former SLA commanders of the prison, and other militiamen responsible for the crimes of inflicting, instigating, and acquiescing to acts of torture at Khiam. If it is necessary to take Gen. Lahd and other potential suspects into custody to carry out this investigation, Israeli authorities should do so. Since Israel does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, the torture convention requires Israel to exercise criminal jurisdiction. Because Gen. Lahd is also known to travel to France, where his immediate family reportedly resides, authorities there are likewise obligated under the convention to initiate an investigation of Gen. Lahd and if necessary detain him when he again sets foot on French soil. The defense ministry's affidavit also includes the important admission that there is a """"connection"""" between Israel's domestic intelligence agency, the General Security Service (GSS, or Shin Bet), and the SLA """"as far as concerns the gathering of intelligence and interrogations that are geared toward preventing terrorist attacks in the security zone against IDF and SLA soldiers."""" It states further that """"GSS personnel cooperate with members of the SLA, and even assist them by means of professional guidance and training, however they do not participate in the frontal interrogation of detainees."""" Gen. Halutz said in the affidavit that """"GSS personnel hold meetings several times annually with SLA interrogators"""" at Khiam, and that from January 1 - July 30, 1999, GSS personnel visited the prison three times. The GSS has a sordid, well-documented history of torturing Palestinian detainees from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its involvement with interrogators at Khiam in occupied south Lebanon -- who have long meted out torture at least as brutal as that systematically administered to Palestinians -- confirms allegations that former Lebanese prisoners and their advocates have been making for years. Just as Israeli authorities have a legal obligation to investigate and prosecute all those responsible for the torture of Palestinian prisoners, they are required to take similar action with respect to GSS personnel who trained SLA militiamen in torture techniques, supervised their activities, or otherwise were complicit in acts of torture that took place at Khiam. Gen. Halutz did not address the issue of even more conspicuous and direct Israeli involvement in interrogation and torture at Khiam in the past, a subject on which former Lebanese detainees have persuasive and copious testimony. His affidavit pointedly states that GSS personnel are not currently involved in face-to-face interrogations of detainees. But there is ample testimonial evidence from former Khiam prisoners about the more direct Israeli role in the past which merits thorough and transparent investigation. For example, a prisoner who was released in May 1998, after eleven years of detention without charge, told me that Israelis were ubiquitous at the prison in the 1980s: """"We saw them all the time. This changed in the last few years, when we only heard them."""" He added that nine detainees died in custody while he was imprisoned, some of them from gross medical neglect, including Assad Bazzi in 1988 and Haytham Dabaja in 1995. Another former prisoner who was released in August 1998 claimed that Israeli intelligence operatives visited Khiam and reviewed investigation files. """"Sometimes they toured the prison, and we were ordered to turn our faces to the wall,"""" he said in an interview in Beirut. Rasmiya Fawzi Jaber, a woman who was detained from January 1990 to June 1991 and tortured, told me that at that time """"Israelis came on a daily basis and supervised what was going on. An Israeli officer named Ibrahim attended the interrogation sessions."""" Another former prisoner, Ibrahim Qalash, detained without charge in Khiam from 1985 to 1990, said that two Israelis who spoke heavily accented Arabic interrogated him about twenty times during a sixty-day period. He described how he was hanged from his bound wrists for long periods and electric-shocked on his fingers, feet, and ears. """"The Israelis would start asking questions, and then call in Lebanese and instruct them on the type of torture to use,"""" he told me. Qalash also testified that one of his Israeli interrogators once became """"fed up"""" and told the Lebanese militiamen present: """"Take him and do whatever you want with him."""" He said that his worst experience was """"being suspended from my wrists outside and hearing the cries of people in the interrogation room. You could tell the type of torture from the screams. When they used electricity, the first thing you heard was a high-pitched cry."""" Qalash was a witness to the circumstances of the death of Ali Hamzeh in 1985, who he said was hanged naked on a cold night and found dead the next morning. It is indisputable that systematic torture occurred in Khiam. And the continuing partnership between Israel and the SLA on matters related to this prison implicates Lebanese and Israelis with legal responsibility for criminal actions. In addition to the periodic visits of GSS personnel, the defense ministry's affidavit admitted that Israel and the SLA """"consult each other regarding the arrest and release of people in the Khiam facility"""" and that """"information from the interrogations in Khiam is transferred by the SLA to Israeli security forces."""" The international community must insist that Israel not turn a blind eye to its complicity in torture at Khiam, which now includes admitted use of information yielded from abusive interrogations. Israel is obligated under international law to hold accountable and prosecute its own citizens and Lebanese nationals who participated in or condoned acts of torture at Khiam. If Israeli authorities refuse to act on this legal obligation, countries that are state parties to the torture convention definitely should.","Middle East/North Africa, Lebanon",""

One man is implicated in the killing of six family members and two men were seen as part of an armed unit in the village of Cuska on May 14, 1999, when forty-one ethnic Albanians were summarily executed.   In a report released today, """"A Village Destroyed: War Crimes in Kosovo,"""" the organization details the grisly events in Cuska, as well as two neighboring villages in western Kosovo, Zahac and Pavljan, where Serbian forces killed another twenty-five people on the same day. The report contains the photographs of the five members of the Serbian security forces who have been identified. It is the first human rights report to name and provide pictures of people who may be responsible for or have first-hand knowledge of war crimes in Kosovo.   In Cuska, Serbian forces took three groups of men into three different houses, where they were sprayed with machine guns, and then set on fire. In each of the three groups of men, one man survived. Their stories and those of other witnesses are provided in the report.   Villagers positively identified in photographs two individuals they claim were present in Cuska on May 14. Witnesses named one man, Zvonimir Cvetkovic, and other sources identified the second man, Srecko Popovic, from these photos. Other witnesses recognized a third man who was present in Zahac on the same day, Slavisa Kastratovic. While none of these men are known to have opened fire on the ethnic Albanians, their presence in the villages means that they should be able to identify the perpetrators, as well as the commanders of the unit. That information is invaluable to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is mandated to investigate and prosecute war crimes in Kosovo.   """"The world knows that terrible crimes were committed in Kosovo, but it's time to start attaching names and faces to those crimes,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Identifying specific perpetrators is an essential part of justice -- and without justice, there can be no lasting peace in the region.""""   The photographs used to identify the men in Cuska were provided to Human Rights Watch by representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). While Human Rights Watch cannot vouch for the authenticity of the photographs, numerous Kosovar Albanians interviewed separately recognized the men mentioned in this report from these photographs, and placed them among the Serbian forces in the villages on the day of the killings. Some witnesses were able to provide names.   A Human Rights Watch researcher scanned the photographs into a laptop computer and then showed them to villagers in Cuska, Zahac, and Pavljan, as well as to people in the city of Pec. The methodology employed was to show the photographs to only one person at a time, preferably in a one-on-one setting. All of the photographs were shown one at a time on the computer screen without any comment or suggestive hints.   In addition to the war crimes committed in Cuska and Zahac on May 14, Human Rights Watch documented a serious crime in Pec, a city that was almost entirely """"cleansed"""" of its ethnic Albanian population in the first week of the NATO bombing campaign. Two witnesses independently identified from a photograph Nebojsa Minic (aka """"Mrtvi,"""" or """"Death""""), and directly implicated him in the extortion and killing of six family members from Pec on June 12.   Numerous witnesses also identified Vidomir Salipur as a Pec policeman with a reputation for his use of torture and beatings against ethnic Albanians. Salipur, who allegedly headed a local militia group called """"Munja,"""" or """"Lightning,"""" was killed by the KLA on April 11, 1999, before the May 14 incident in Cuska. In Photograph no. 6 published in the report, Salipur is standing next to Nebojsa Minic.   The motive for the killing in Cuska, Pavljan and Zahac remains unclear. There is no evidence to suggest any KLA presence in the villages in 1998 or 1999, and no policemen or soldiers are known to have died in the immediate vicinity during the NATO bombing, which might have made revenge a possible motive. One explanation offered by local villagers is that Cuska was the home of Hasan Ceku, the father of Agim Ceku, military head of the KLA.   There is also evidence of Yugoslav Army involvement in the attack. A number of sources reported seeing documents from the army regarding a military buildup around Cuska shortly before May 14. One Western journalist claimed to have seen Yugoslav Army documents that ordered the village to be """"cleansed.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The committee acted against the three journalists because they visited Israel in September, in violation of JPA's ban on any form of contact and """"normalization"""" with Israel. The journalists had accepted a private invitation of the Center for Arab-Jewish Studies at Haifa University to attend a seminar about the treatment of Palestinian residents of Israel. The disturbing significance of the decision, which as of this date the JPA executive committee has not officially approved in writing, is that the expulsions prohibit the three journalists from practicing their profession because Jordan's press and publications law requires all journalists to maintain membership in one professional syndicate, the JPA.  This case brings into sharp focus the urgent need to amend the press law. The requirement of mandatory membership for journalists is unreasonable, and violates the right to freedom of association and expression, which Jordan as a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is pledged to uphold. As explained below, it can be used as a tool of censorship to suppress unpopular information, ideas, and opinions.  In order to carry out their professional duties, journalists require full enjoyment of freedom of expression, including the """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds,"""" as set forth in article 19 of the ICCPR. The freedom to seek information may in many cases include the right to freedom of movement, enshrined in article 12 of the ICCPR. To ensure free expression in the media, journalists must be free to travel to any country to obtain information and ideas, and to exchange views and opinions. Interference with this right, as in the case of the JPA's self-imposed ban on its members'contact with Israelis, is an unacceptable infringement on free expression and a form of censorship.  Journalists also should have the freedom to join or form any professional association that they wish, but they should not be compelled under the law to join a specific organization in order to practice their profession. More importantly, journalists should never have to face the prospect of forfeiting the right to work in Jordan because they do not choose to join the JPA or because they travel to a country that the JPA disapproves of.  In April of this year, Human Rights Watch met with numerous practicing journalists in Amman who expressed strong opposition to the mandatory membership requirement in the press law and called for its cancellation. We are adding our voice to theirs. The definition of a journalist in the press law -- as a person who is registered as a member of the JPA -- should be revoked, and we encourage your government to introduce to parliament proposed legislation to this effect.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/10/24/letter-president-asad","Letter to President Asad","Letter to President Asad","","10/24/1999","Human Rights Watch is writing to bring to your urgent attention the extremely difficult circumstances faced by Nizar Nayouf, the thirty-seven-year-old writer and human rights activist who is serving a ten-year sentence in solitary confinement in Mezze military prison in Damascus.  Nayouf is one of five human rights activists who are imprisoned in Syria. All five were affiliated with the Committees for the Defense of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, a loosely organized network of young activists that authorities arrested in late 1991 and early 1992. Nayouf's colleagues -- Muhamed Ali Habib, Afif Muzhir, Bassam al-Shaykh, and Thabet Murad -- are held in Sednaya prison. All five men were sentenced in 1992 to eight to ten years by the Supreme State Security Court for membership in an unauthorized organization, among other offenses. Human Rights Watch continues to appeal for the release of these human rights defenders, whose only apparent offense was the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association, which in their case included criticism of government policies and practices. With releases earlier this year in Algeria and Tunisia, Syria is the only country in the region where human rights activists are serving lengthy prison terms. Among the five Syrians, Nizar Nayouf's particular situation raises humanitarian concerns. Last year, Human Rights Watch joined Arab human rights organizations and other international groups in calling for Nayouf's release on humanitarian grounds because he reportedly was suffering from Hodgkin's disease and not receiving proper medical treatment. Appeals were also made to Syrian authorities and ambassadors abroad for independent medical experts to have access to Nayouf in prison for the purpose of evaluating his health needs. In response to this campaign, Human Rights Watch received a letter from His Excellency Walid al-Moualem, Syria's ambassador to the United States, dated December 10, 1998. In this letter, Ambassador Moualem denied that Nayouf had Hodgkin's disease and wrote: """"Rather, he is suffering [from] hernia of nucleus pulposus [slipped disc]. The doctors treating him have concluded that he did not require surgery, treatment with medicines should be sufficient. His health condition has since improved."""" But the information that we have recently received suggests that Nizar Nayouf was in fact treated for Hodgkin's disease some time early in 1999 and that he responded well to such treatment. However, it now appears that medical tests performed in August 1999 indicated that the disease had returned in full force, and that chemotherapy treatment could prolong Nizar Nayouf's life. Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch cannot independently confirm this information, which is why we are writing to appeal to you to intervene in this case and ensure that Nayouf is immediately released and is able to receive the medical attention and treatment that he requires. We hope that as an urgent matter you will direct responsible authorities to make inquiries about the continuing reports that Nizar Nayouf is suffering from Hodgkin's disease and that chemotherapy now may be required to save and prolong his life. Human Rights Watch also respectfully reiterates our earlier recommendation to Syrian authorities that a team of independent medical professionals be permitted to visit Nayouf in prison, review his medical files, and consult with the Syrian physicians who have been providing him care and treatment. In our view, such a mission would provide reassurances to all of those around the world who remain deeply concerned about Nizar Nayouf. We thank you in advance for your attention to this matter, and your appreciation of the humanitarian aspects of Nizar Nayouf's case.

U.S. Ambassador for War Crimes David Scheffer was slated to meet with Cambodian officials this weekend.   """"We welcome recent reports that Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen may be ready to return to discussions on a tribunal with international participation,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But any discussion must be based on international principles and standards."""" It is unclear whether a recent U.S. diplomatic initiative to break deadlocked U.N.-Cambodian negotiations upholds the minimum standards of justice the U.N. has insisted on in its discussions with the Cambodian government. Details of the U.N.-Cambodian negotiations have not been revealed.  Jones noted that the U.N. has already presented detailed proposals to the Cambodian government for a tribunal that meets international standards and is currently waiting for draft implementing legislation from the Cambodian government to that effect. """"Any U.S. diplomatic initiative should support the groundwork laid by the U.N.,"""" said Jones.  According to press reports, the United States has recently proposed that a """"super majority"""" of judges be required for all judgments as a way of circumventing an impasse between the U.N. and the Cambodian government over whether international or Cambodian judges would predominate. In this formulation, Cambodian judges would be in the majority, but more than the number of Cambodian judges would be required for any decision, effectively giving foreign judges veto power. Other aspects of the U.S. plan reportedly call for U.N. monitoring of the tribunal, limiting the scope of prosecutions, and creating a special chamber within the existing Cambodian court system to try the Khmer Rouge. It remains unclear in the U.S. proposal who would appoint judges and prosecutors. Human Rights Watch believes that the prosecutor and judges should all be approved by the United Nations secretary general. While a super majority voting system may be valuable, the token inclusion of international judges does not substitute for ensuring that the prosecutor and judges-- whether international or Cambodian-- are of the highest integrity, caliber and independence.  In addition to ensuring the quality of the judges, Human Rights Watch urged that the parties to the negotiations should also ensure that no artificial limit be placed on the number of defendants, nor should anyone in the senior Khmer Rouge leadership be excluded from trial, in order to prevent political bias in prosecutions. Instead, jurisdiction should cover those responsible for the most serious crimes during the 1975-1979 period.  At the request of the Cambodian government, the U.N. has sent two groups of experts to Cambodia to evaluate options for bringing the Khmer Rouge to justice. In August the experts recommended to the Security Council that trials take place in Cambodia, with indictments prepared by international prosecutors and approved by a predominantly non-Cambodian panel of judges appointed by the Secretary-General. Until recently Hun Sen has rejected this formulation, calling for limited international participation in a tribunal within the Cambodian court system, with foreign judges in a minority. """"Unless the U.N. is in full control of the process, any tribunal would likely be subject to political manipulation,"""" said Jones, noting that Cambodia's three leading legal aid organizations recently called for U.N. control over Khmer Rouge trials because the Cambodian judicial system is subject to pervasive political influence and lacks judicial impartiality.","Asia, United States, Cambodia","International Justice, United Nations"

""""Gus Dur personally has been a staunch defender of human rights, but he owes his election to political blocs with many ties to the Soeharto past,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"We'll be waiting to see who he appoints to key posts—particularly to head the armed forces and the ministries of defense, home affairs, and justice."""" Human Rights Watch said President Wahid would be facing several key challenges immediately that will test both his political skills and his commitment to protecting human rights. These include:  social unrest, from violent demonstrations on the part of disappointed supporters of Megawati Soekarnoputri to communal clashes in the outer islands such as Ambon. President Wahid will need to move quickly away from the old pattern of responding almost exclusively with force and focus instead on addressing the underlying political and economic problems. continuing military abuses in response to armed and unarmed independence movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya. President Wahid will need urgently to address deep-seated grievances in both places, and one of those grievances is the failure of the Indonesian government to prosecute military officers responsible for human rights abuses. As a candidate, Gus Dur promised that he would support a referendum in Aceh, a promise likely to encounter strong military resistance, particularly after the experience in East Timor. Community leaders in both Aceh and Irian Jaya are demanding a substantial reduction in troop strength, because """"non-organic"""" troops —soldiers brought in from outside the region—have tended to commit more abuses. corruption, particularly on the part of the Soeharto family and its cronies, including former President Habibie. Unless President Wahid reopens the investigation into Soeharto's wealth that Habibie shut down last week and makes a serious effort to prosecute corruption from this point on, he will risk leaving the impression, as his predecessors did, that those close to political power are above the law. quick resolution of remaining problems in East Timor. President Wahid in the 1980s and early 90s was outspoken in his condemnation of abuses in East Timor and his support of a referendum, at a time when it was politically dangerous to criticize government policy. He made a point of going to Cipinang Prison to meet with Xanana Gusmao in May 1999 and to Dili in July, but, uncharacteristically, he joined the nationalist chorus of criticism against the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) and the backlash against Australia in the weeks after the referendum. It will be a test of his human rights policy to see how quickly he ensures the protection and return of refugees from West Timor, gives full support to both the domestic and international inquiry into abuses in East Timor, and cooperates with the new U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor. discrimination against the ethnic Chinese. President Wahid himself has been a friend to the ethnic Chinese, and he has repeatedly espoused a pluralist vision for Indonesia that embraces both religious and ethnic minorities. But he came to power with the support of many Muslim parties, some members of which have not shown such tolerance, and Chinese-Indonesians are likely to be nervous. Wahid could assuage their fears by moving quickly to ensure that no discriminatory laws or practices left over from previous administrations remain. the dark shadows of Indonesia's past. One of the darkest periods in modern Indonesian history, the massacres of 1965-67, remains largely unexplored. Little by little, new information has begun to emerge as Indonesia moves out of Soeharto's authoritarian shadow, but President Wahid could substantially advance the process by giving a presidential imprimatur to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission he set up as a private initiative after the May 1998 riots. If the work of the commission could be extended backward to 1965-67, he could truly set a precedent for open, comprehensive investigation of the large-scale abuses that have sullied Indonesian politics for over three decades. It would be particularly appropriate for Gus Dur to initiate this process because a youth group affiliated with his organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, played a major role in the killings of suspected Communist Party members in East Java in 1965-66.","Asia, Indonesia",""

The report, Class Dismissed: Discriminatory Expulsions of Muslim Students describes the government's zero-tolerance policy toward Muslim students who wear headscarves and beards. Government officials have unceremoniously expelled the students from schools and universities. Most of those expelled were girls and young women. """"The government of Uzbekistan is assaulting religious freedom from all sides,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The expulsion of Muslim students is yet another aspect of this campaign."""" In some cases, university officials have joined state security agents to intimidate and harass Muslim students who persisted in wearing religious attire, and their families. The Ministry of State Security (the successor to the KGB) has threatened some students, and warned their parents of being fired from their jobs. The discriminatory policy is part of the Karimov government's crackdown on Muslims not affiliated with government-sanctioned mosques. Since late 1997, police and security forces have arrested thousands of Muslims who do not adhere to officially-sanctioned Islam or do not attend government-approved mosques. Police have planted evidence on suspects and beaten detainees. Judges presided over blatantly unfair trials, ignoring police misdeeds and convicting men on the basis of their religious beliefs. The Uzbek government has claimed that the students' religious attire identifies them as members of """"Wahabi"""" sects seeking to establish an Islamic state. Yet none of the students claimed affiliation with """"Wahabism,"""" and none was charged with any violent act or with disrupting public order. Last month, the U.S. State Department criticized Uzbekistan for its religious practices in its first report on religious freedom around the world. Prior to the report's release, the Uzbek government released five Christians imprisoned for their religious beliefs.

The 100-page report, """"Crime or Custom? Violence Against Women in Pakistan,"""" documents a virtual epidemic of crimes of violence against women, including domestic violence rates as high as 90 percent, at least eight reported rapes every 24 hours nationwide, and an alarming rise in so-called honor killings. """"As the world focuses on Pakistan's dramatic political crisis, fifty percent of the population remains caught in a different kind of crisis,"""" said Samya Burney, author of the report and researcher for the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. """"Women in Pakistan face spiraling rates of gender-based violence, a legal framework that is deeply biased against women, and a law enforcement system that retraumatizes female victims instead of facilitating justice,"""" she added. Violence against women has risen to staggering levels. Women's low social status and a long established pattern of active suppression of women's rights by successive governments has contributed to the escalation in violence. No government has acknowledged the scale and severity of the problem—much less taken action to end the violence against women. When a Commission of Inquiry for women convened by the Pakistan Senate described domestic violence as one of the country's most pervasive violations of human rights, its findings were brushed aside by the Sharif government. As a result of such dismissive official attitudes, crimes of violence against women continue to be perpetrated with near total impunity. """"If the new leadership that emerges in Pakistan is genuinely interested in legal and institutional reform, then violence against women is an issue it cannot afford to ignore,"""" said Burney. """"The problem of violence against women must be urgently and systematically tackled by whatever government comes to power in Pakistan."""" According to the new report, domestic violence victims have virtually no access to judicial protection and redress. Officials at all levels of the criminal justice system do not consider domestic violence a matter for the criminal courts. Domestic violence is routinely dismissed by law enforcement authorities as a private dispute and female victims who attempt to register a police complaint of spousal or familial physical abuse are invariably turned away. Worse, they are regularly advised and sometimes pressured by the police to reconcile with their abusive spouses or relatives. Women who report rape or sexual assault by strangers fare marginally better than victims of domestic violence. Victims who are persistent and determined sometimes succeed in registering complaints. However, reflecting the institutionalized gender bias that pervades the criminal justice system, women alleging rape are often disbelieved and treated with disrespect, indeed harassed outright, by officials at all levels. They must contend with abusive police, forensic doctors who focus on their virginity status instead of their injuries, untrained prosecutors, skeptical judges, and a discriminatory and deficient legal framework. """"Only the most resilient and resourceful complainants can maneuver such hostile terrain,"""" said Burney, """"And those who do seldom see their attackers punished."""" Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had actively harassed and attempted to silence women's rights activists. Women's rights advocacy organizations increasingly had been subjected to a range of intimidatory tactics, including stepped up government surveillance and threats that their organizations would be banned. """"The resurrection of civil society in Pakistan should be a top priority for those in control of the country following the coup,"""" said Burney. """"As a first step, the nongovernmental sector must be allowed to function freely and independently."""" Human Rights Watch called for the explicit criminalization of all forms of domestic and familial violence against women and the establishment of clear guidelines for police intervention and protection in such cases. The international monitoring organization also urged the repeal of Pakistan's rape law, the Offence of Zina Ordinance, which allows marital rape, does not establish the crime of statutory rape, and which in some cases does not permit the female victim to testify. The report also urges that Pakistani authorities ensure that law enforcement personnel are trained to eliminate biases against women in their responses to cases of violence against women.","Asia, Pakistan","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence, Sexual Violence and Rape"

""""Whatever government comes to power now must ensure that the rights of all Pakistani citizens are protected."""" In declaring the state of emergency, Gen.

A weakened judiciary was able to provide little protection against for the encroachment on civil liberties.

""""We are deeply concerned that the new approach by European leaders of promoting human rights in China only through dialogue fails to link specific progress in human rights to improved relations between the European Union and China."""" said Lotte Leicht, Brussels director of Human Rights Watch. """"It is essential that Prime Minister Blair protest the recent deterioration in human rights conditions in China and present an agenda of concrete steps that Beijing should take."""" Human Rights Watch has documented a sharp downturn in basic freedoms over the past year including tightened controls on freedom of association, expression, assembly and belief. (See backgrounder attached). Controls were increased as China prepared for the anniversaries of several sensitive dates: the fortieth anniversary of the March 10, 1959 Tibetan uprising, the tenth anniversary of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Over the past year a prolonged economic slump has fueled unrest and heightened the government's concerns with stability. President Jiang Zemin's determination to bolster the Chinese Communist Party, to placate hardliners, and to secure his own place in history has contributed to heightened intolerance of any organization openly critical of the Party's platform or attempting to function outside Party control. Individuals and groups suspected of ties to """"hostile"""" foreign organizations and those disseminating sensitive political information overseas are particularly targeted. Over the past year state control of religious affairs in Tibet has intensified. Dozens of judicial executions have been reported from Xinjiang, where some ethnic Uighur groups are advocating a separate state; other alleged """"splittists"""" have been sentenced to long prison terms. Judicial independence and the rule of law in the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong was seriously undermined when the SAR government asked Beijing to interpret a ruling by the SAR's highest court. The two key United Nations human rights treaties signed by China in 1997 and 1998 remain unratified. On the positive side, legal reform efforts continue in China, although the legal system remains highly politicized. Supreme Court President Xiao Yang announced in March that in the interests of transparency, trials would be open and verdicts quickly made public, except for cases involving state secrets. In April, he announced plans to curb government interference with the legal process. """"We agree that the UK should undertake an effort to encourage China's integration as a fully responsible and constructive member of the international community."""" said Ms. Leicht. """"Promoting transparency, accountability, the rule of law, and greater protection of basic human rights is essential to that objective."""" Human Rights Watch urged Prime Minister Blair to pursue the following concrete recommendations with his Chinese counterparts: 1. Getting agreement to release, amnesty or at the very least review the convictions of the approximately 2000 persons still imprisoned on charges of """"counterrevolution."""" """"Counterrevolution"""" has been formally abolished as a crime, but the Chinese government has stated that its abolition will have no effect on those already convicted. They include numerous nuns and monks from Tibet, labor rights activists and people imprisoned in connection with the crackdown of peaceful demonstrators in June 1989. 2. Initiation of a process to end the system of re-education through labor, which leads to the arbitrary detention of thousands of Chinese citizens each year, without charge or trial. 3. Securing a verifiable commitment from China to implement safeguards on freedom of association and labor rights as per its obligations as a member of the International Labor Organization. The International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and Civil and Political Rights which China has signed but not ratified, also contain important safeguards on freedom of association, assembly and expression. 4. Obtaining verifiable information on the current status and whereabouts of the Panchen Lama, Gendun Choeki Nyima, the child chosen by the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the reincarnation of an important Tibetan religious figure. Secure independent access to him for British or United Naitons officials. 5. Getting agreement on unrestricted access to Tibet and Xinjiang by the international press, human rights and humanitarian organizations. 6. Securing a commitment that international humanitarian organizations will be allowed regular access to China's prison system.  7. Pressing for abolition of the death penalty.

The report was submitted to the United Nations to describe U.S. compliance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the U.S. ratified in October 1994. The U.S. compliance report was submitted four years late.  """"The government has confronted the undeniable and unfortunate reality that the poor, minority, and criminal offenders, in particular, are subjected to treatment prohibited under this treaty and denounced by the U.S. when it occurs in other countries,"""" said Roth.  While acknowledging the existence of abuses, the report downplays the pervasiveness of impunity for those abuses. Indeed, the report suggests that most instances of torture or other ill-treatment are prosecuted. In fact, the vigorous prosecution of the New York City police officers accused of beating and sodomizing Abner Louima, for example, was extraordinary. It is rare for cases without massive press attention to be prosecuted at all. Police and prison officers who use excessive force amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are typically not held responsible for those acts through the failure to prosecute or discipline them administratively. """"For every Louima case prosecuted in good faith, there are many other instances of torture and serious ill treatment in which brutal officers enjoy impunity,"""" said Roth.  The report also glosses over the difficulties faced by victims when they seek legal redress, such as restrictions on access to courts, inadequate legal representation, procedural constraints, and narrow legal interpretations that limit the scope and efficacy of laws prohibiting torture and other serious ill-treatment. Human Rights Watch and others have made numerous recommendations for changes in law and practice that would help end abuses and provide better legal protections when they do occur. The Clinton administration should move to implement these, and other, reforms. Progress will only be possible if the federal government is willing to use its political weight, moral suasion, and other means at its disposal to press federal, state, and local officials to meet their human rights obligations described in this report.","United States",""

Human Rights Watch urged Secretary Albright to express strong support for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body which is envisaged in the Sierra Leone peace agreement but has not yet been established. Similarly, the U.S. should back the formation of an United Nations commission of inquiry into human rights violations in the eight year civil war. The United States helped broker the peace agreement, which includes a general amnesty for all crimes committed during the war. In a June 1999 report, Human Rights Watch documented these extensive atrocities, including the murder, rape, and limb amputation of thousands of civilians. """"The United States has not pursued justice as vigorously in Sierra Leone as it has in other parts of the world,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division. """"We believe the amnesty in Sierra Leone is a mistake and will undermine the peace agreement in the end.

Since the signing of the Peace Agreement on July 7, the rebels have continued to rape and abduct civilians and loot villages Human Rights Watch urged Secretary Albright to back a stronger mandate for a United Nations peacekeeping force to enforce the July 7 peace agreement between the Sierra Leonean government and rebels. The U.N. Security Council will vote this week on whether to give the peacekeepers """"Chapter Seven"""" powers, which would authorize them to use force to protect civilians. Human Rights Watch said Secretary Albright should also use her meeting with Foday Sankoh, the leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front who has now joined the government, to urge him to release thousands of abductees. At least 2,871 children have been missing since the rebels' January offensive on Freetown. The rebels are also still using hundreds of girls and women as sexual partners whom they have pledged to release. In regard to Nigeria, Secretary Albright should welcome the steps the new Nigerian government has taken to improve human rights and the rule of law, such as extending the mandate of a commission to investigate past human rights abuses to 1966, the date of the first military coup. The U.S. should recognize President Olusegun Obasanjo's efforts to defuse the crisis in the Niger Delta, but urge him not to allow Nigerian security forces to respond violently to expressions of discontent in the region, Human Rights Watch said. In particular, the U.S. should press for an independent judicial enquiry to investigate past and current human rights violations in the Niger Delta, and to discipline or prosecute those responsible.

A new report released today by Human Rights Watch finds that the arrest of former dictator Augusto Pinochet has dramatically changed the judicial landscape in Chile, forcing Chileans to deal more openly with matters too long swept under the rug. """"The recent developments in the courts signify very important progress in human rights in Chile that were never dreamed of before Pinochet's arrest,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch.   Dire forecasts of political turmoil and instability have not been born out. """"The apocalypse so widely predicted to occur in Chile unless Pinochet were freed has not come about,"""" added Vivanco. """"Indeed, Chilean democracy has benefited from Pinochet's prosecution.""""   London police arrested Pinochet, Chile's military ruler from 1973 to 1990, on October 16, 1998, at the request of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón, whose indictment against Pinochet included genocide, murder, and torture of thousands. Further developments have narrowed the offenses ruled extraditable to torture and conspiracy to commit torture after December 1988. The judge ordering Pinochet's extradition last week included psycological torture suffered by relatives of the disappeared as an offense that could eventually be tried before Spanish courts.   As Chile prepares for presidential elections in December 1999, the Pinochet arrest has prompted debate about the human rights legacy of the military. The crisis has also highlighted the undemocratic aspects of the constitution which Chile inherited from Pinochet.   In the 53-page report, """"When Tyrants Tremble: The Pinochet Case,"""" Human Rights Watch describes encouraging developments in Chilean courts during the year since Pinochet's arrest. Before Pinochet's arrest, the courts stifled most prosecutions of human rights violations from the military government through application of a 1978 amnesty law.   However, the Supreme Court of Chile recently allowed prosecutions in """"disappearance"""" cases to proceed, despite the amnesty, on the grounds that such cases are continuing crimes. Courts have charged several high-ranking military officers in """"disappearance"""" cases over the past year. A Chilean judge investigating more than forty criminal complaints against General Pinochet is preparing to send him a list of questions he is obliged to answer. """"While the amnesty law still obstructs justice, the courts are finally taking responsibility for cases that fall outside its scope,"""" said Vivanco.   Representatives of the armed forces are participating along with human rights lawyers in talks promoted by the Chilean Minister of Defense that are aimed at providing long-concealed information about the fate of more than 1,000 people who """"disappeared"""" under Pinochet's rule. Defense Minister Edmundo Pérez Yoma has given assurances that the talks would respect the autonomy of the courts, a vital condition for their legitimacy.   Human Rights Watch has applauded Spain's effort to prosecute General Pinochet for crimes against humanity and Britain's cooperation. The Spanish and British actions have set vital precedents establishing the personal criminal responsibility of former heads of state for atrocities committed under their rule.   Human Rights Watch urges Chile to:  Ensure that the amnesty law is not used to close prosecutions of gross violations of human rights; Reform the system of military justice to restrict its jurisdiction to properly military offenses; Enable civilian judges or officials to carry out investigations on military premises without impediment; End the representation of the armed forces on the Supreme Court; and cooperate with the Spanish court investigating the case against Pinochet.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/10/14/ready-justice","Ready for Justice","Ready for Justice","","10/14/1999","(Santiago, Chile) - Returning home after a year's absence, I am astonished at the change. On the eve of the anniversary of the arrest last Oct. 16 of Augusto Pinochet, Chilean democracy has weathered the storm. Last October, the country was reeling from the decision of British authorities to hold General Pinochet in London, not for any crime committed in England or in Spain, where a warrant had originated, but for the murder or disappearance of 3,000 civilians during his military dictatorship in Chile in the 70's and 80's. Some Chileans were laying siege to the British and Spanish embassies while others celebrated the arrest as a moral victory. There were fears of a return to the polarization and instability of the 1970's. Apart from a noisy minority, most Chileans today seem comfortable with the prosecution of General Pinochet. Polls show a majority now believe he should be brought to justice, although there is disagreement about whether justice should be administered at home or abroad. Neither presidential candidate in December's election is focusing much attention on his fate. There is one vitally important way, however, in which the arrest has wrought dramatic change. A year ago, the Chilean government's assertion that it would judge General Pinochet's crimes at home did not pass the most basic credibility test. Today, Chilean courts have discovered the injustices suffered by his victims. For the first time, they have sidestepped the 1978 amnesty law intended to shield the military. They have reinterpreted that law, ruling that because relatives of the ''disappeared'' live in constant torment, not knowing the fate of their loved ones who were taken away during the Pinochet regime, the disappearances are a continuing crime, extending beyond the years covered by the amnesty. The general's subordinates inside Chile are facing human rights trials. General Pinochet remains one of the most powerful men in Chile, with the unstinting loyalty of the armed forces. Despite continuing political obstacles, Chile is moving toward a day when it might be possible for its courts to prosecute even him. In the meantime, the precedent set by the cooperation of Britain in the Spanish prosecution opens up new possibilities for the exercise of universal jurisdiction for crimes recognized around the world to be violations of human rights.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

Just ask Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri. In August the top aide to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fled Austria, where he was in a hospital, to elude a private criminal complaint citing his alleged role in Iraq's genocide against the Kurds. """"From now on all Iraqi officials will have to choose countries like Russia or China for medical treatment,"""" cautioned one Arab diplomat. Even those countries don't seem safe enough to former Ethiopian strongman Mengistu Haile Mariam, who has been hiding out in Zimbabwe under the protection of President Robert Mugabe after the downfall of his """"Red Terror"""" regime. With Mugabe's rule looking shaky itself, Mengistu, who is wanted back home for the murder of more than 200,000 people, has reportedly visited isolated North Korea to explore retirement options. He might also consider Saudi Arabia, which is providing sanctuary and a stipend for former dictator Idi Amin of Uganda. When asked about the possibility of Amin's extradition, a Saudi ambassador explained to Human Rights Watch that Bedouin hospitality meant that once someone was welcomed as a guest in your tent, you did not turn him out. But recently other countries have not laid out the welcome mat for accused torturers. In July, French police arrested a Mauritanian colonel, Ely Ould Dah, for allegedly torturing prisoners in his country. Indonesia's ailing former ruler, Suharto, reportedly canceled a trip to Germany for treatment for fear of the """"Pinochet precedent."""" Indeed, the arrest of Pinochet, like the indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by the United Nations war crimes tribunal, shows how far we have come from the days when despots could terrorize their own populations, secure in the knowledge that they would never be brought to book. Until recently, it seemed that if you killed one person, you went to jail, but if you slaughtered thousands, you usually got away with it. Times change, however. The twin genocides of the 1990s in Bosnia and Rwanda seem to have given the rest of the world -- which did nothing to prevent them -- a guilty conscience, and the United Nations Security Council, freed from its Cold War paralysis, created tribunals to judge the perpetrators of those ghastly events. The genocides also boosted another idea designed to place much of the world off-limits to traveling tyrants: a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) to judge future atrocities when national courts are unwilling or unable to do so. A remarkable coalition of nations - - from Europe to new democracies in South Africa, South Korea, Argentina, and Chile -- backed the ICC at final negotiations last July in Rome. The United States delegation, adamant that Americans not be subjected to justice that Washington couldn't control, tried strenuously to weaken the court. One unfortunate result is that the ICC -- which still needs 60 ratifications before it begins to work --will generally not have jurisdiction over tyrants whose own countries do not ratify the court's statute. That could make the Pinochet precedent even more critical in the years ahead. Under international law, any state may prosecute persons who commit genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, no matter where the crime took place. Indeed, the UN Torture Convention, enacted precisely to deny suspected torturers any safe haven, requires that states investigate or extradite alleged torturers who enter their territories. The Torture Convention provided the basis for Britain's arrest of Pinochet and France's arrest of Ely Ould Dah. Pinochet's arrest awakened the hopes of victims around the world, many of whom are now exploring how to use foreign courts to bring their tormentors to justice. Such extraterritorial prosecutions test the political will of the countries involved. In the Pinochet case, Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw twice made the diplomatically costly decision to allow Spain's extradition bid to proceed, while Spain itself faces reprisals from its Latin partners. By contrast, Austria's decision to allow Izzat Ibrahim to fly home cynically placed relations with Iraq above the dictates of the law. But precedents are being set. Augusto Pinochet was the first former head of state to be arrested by another country for human rights crimes. He will not be the last. Slobodan Milosevic was the first sitting head of state to be indicted for human rights crimes. He will not be the last. Future leaders are on notice: If they try to get away with murder and torture, they could be brought to justice. And if they have already tortured, they should not travel.","Americas, Chile, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

In making its case under the European Convention on Extradition, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), representing Spain, was not required to present proof of Pinochet's guilt.    What is the significance of the Magistrate's ruling on evidence of conspiracy?    The House of Lords, in its second decision on March 24, 1999, ruled that the only crimes for which General Pinochet could be extradited were torture and conspiracy to torture after December 8, 1988, when the U.N. torture convention took effect in the U.K. Magistrate Bartle specifically ruled, however, that Pinochet's conduct before 1988---which would include the creation of the secret police and the establishment of Operation Condor targeting Pinochet's opponents abroad---could be examined by the Spanish courts in proving the existence of a conspiracy which continued after December 1988. This ruling is in line with the language of the House of Lords decision. Secretary of State Jack Straw also took pre-December 1988 conduct into account when issuing his Authority to Proceed on the conspiracy count.     The conspiracy charge goes to the heart of the case because it alleges that Pinochet used torture as a weapon of intimidation and political persecution. By allowing evidence of conduct that occurred before 1988, Bartle's ruling clearly permits the Spanish prosecutors to prove that General Pinochet built a state apparatus that relied on torture and that he was fully aware that torture was practiced systematically.    What was the Magistrate's ruling on the """"disappearance"""" cases?     The Spanish extradition request details the cases of 1,198 """"disappearances"""" carried out by Pinochet's regime, and these were presented to the Magistrate as part of the conspiracy count. """"Disappearances"""" are considered continuing crimes as long as the fate of the """"disappeared"""" remains hidden---and thus they continue past 1988 even if the victims were abducted earlier. Bartle ruled that """"the effect on the families of those who disappeared can amount to mental torture,"""" (thus bringing the acts within the """"torture"""" conspiracy ) and that Spanish prosecutors could seek to prove that this was General Pinochet's intention.     Although there have been U.N. declarations and U.N. and European court rulings on the subject, this appears to be the first time that a national court has ruled that disappearances can be a form of torture for the loved ones of the """"disappeared."""" For the Magistrate to uphold these allegations is thus a historic acknowledgment of the families' continuing anguish. In the context of this case, it also constitutes an invitation to Spain to detail these cases and show that Pinochet used this cruel practice as a form of terror.    What are the grounds on which Pinochet can appeal the Magistrate's ruling?     General Pinochet has fifteen days from the date of the Magistrate's ruling within which to bring a habeas corpus petition before the Divisional Court (High Court). Britain's Extradition Act provides that discharge may be warranted on any of the following grounds: the trivial nature of the offense, the passage of time since the offense was committed, or the bad faith of the accusation. If one of these grounds is met, the judge may then examine whether the ground alleged, having regard to all the circumstances, creates a situation where it would be """"unjust or oppressive"""" to send him to Spain. In reviewing the habeas corpus petition, the Divisional Court will not be acting as an appeals court with respect to questions of fact, as long as the Magistrate had sufficient evidence before him to order committal.    What is meant by """"unjust or oppressive?""""     In examining whether extradition would be """"unjust or oppressive,"""" the British courts regularly return to the test that Lord Diplock set out in Kakis v. Government of Cyprus. """"‘Unjust' I regard as directed primarily to the risk of prejudice to the accused in the conduct of the trial itself, ‘oppressive' as directed to hardship of the accused resulting from changes in his circumstances that have occurred during the period to be taken into consideration.""""    If the Divisional Court upholds the Magistrate's decision, can Pinochet appeal?     If leave is granted, General Pinochet may take his habeas corpus petition to the House of Lords. Although some lawyers assert that he may do this as of right, without seeking leave to appeal, Magistrate Bartle's decision indicates otherwise.    What happens when Pinochet's appeals are exhausted?     The matter returns to Home Secretary, Jack Straw, who will make a final decision on extradition. If Straw ultimately decides to extradite General Pinochet, Pinochet can seek judicial review of the decision at the Divisional Court if he is granted leave to appeal. At this stage, the Divisional Court could only rule that the Home Secretary used his discretion unreasonably. Given the Secretary's wide discretion, the likelihood of success is extremely narrow. The decision of the Divisional Court can be appealed to the House of Lords if leave is granted. What will be the effect of the case Chile is filing against Spain at the International Court of Justice?     The case that Chile is filing against Spain at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is not likely to impact the case against General Pinochet. Under the Statute of the International Court of Justice and Article 30 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the ICJ is competent to settle disputes regarding the interpretation of the Convention. The Torture Convention stipulates that parties with a dispute as to the meaning of the Convention are to submit to arbitration if unable to settle the dispute through negotiation. If, after six months, the dispute cannot be resolved, the parties may refer the dispute to the ICJ.     The Chilean Government requested that Spain submit to bilateral arbitration to resolve the question of whether a Spanish court has the authority to try General Pinochet under the Torture Convention. Chile asserts that Spain's attempt to exercise jurisdiction over General Pinochet is improper as the alleged crimes occurred in Chile. Because Spain refused to submit to arbitration, Chile proceeded directly to the ICJ.     Given Spain's refusal to arbitrate, it seems likely that the case will ultimately go forward at the ICJ if pressed by Chile. An ICJ proceeding could take up to two years, however, and it is unlikely that the ICJ would order that Pinochet's extradition to Spain or his prosecution should be stayed pending the ICJ decision. If Chile decides to go forward, it would more likely serve only to settle the scope and applicability of the Torture Convention. Given the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in the Convention, Human Rights Watch is confident that the ICJ would find Chile's interpretation of the Convention erroneous.    Given the assertion that Pinochet is ill, should he be released by the British courts?     General Pinochet's request to be released due to his poor health raises two issues under international law. First, all people deprived of their liberty are entitled to be treated with dignity. General Pinochet is thus entitled, for instance, to adequate medical care (which he appears to be receiving). Second, those facing trial must be able to participate in their own defense, which is an essential component of the right to a fair trial. This means that a person should be mentally capable of understanding the charges and participating in his defense, as well as physically fit to attend the trial if he chooses.     Because of the gravity of the offenses with which General Pinochet is charged, any decision regarding his release should be made with caution. The mere fact that a person is ill does not place him above enforcement of the law. General Pinochet should only be released upon a judicial determination that he is not, and will not be, fit to stand trial.    How have the British courts ruled when considering an applicant's ill health as a ground for discharge under the Extradition Act?     Many applicants have asserted that their extradition would be """"oppressive"""" due to the """"passage of time"""" since the alleged crimes were committed (see above), when considered in light of their current ill health. Recent British cases have shown little leniency on health grounds in habeas corpus proceedings, however, to those who have been committed for extradition. Courts have ruled that """"it needs to be shown that it is the passage of time that has caused the oppression.""""    If the courts do not release Pinochet, is it possible that the Home Secretary will release him on """"humanitarian"""" grounds?     Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, may refuse extradition on any of the grounds reviewed by the Divisional Court (see above), or under his general discretionary powers. The Home Secretary, in issuing his second Authority to Proceed on April 15, stated that in his final decision, he would """"consider the extradition request afresh...tak[ing] into account any findings in the committal proceedings and any habeas corpus proceedings as well as any representations which Senator Pinochet may wish to make against return.""""     In particular, the Secretary indicated that the question of whether Pinochet's """"age and health would render it unjust or oppressive"""" to extradite him was a """"question, among others, [which could] be re-examined in the light of any developments, at the stage when he comes to exercise his final discretion at the end of the extradition process.""""     If the Home Secretary is considering a """"humanitarian"""" release, he should appoint independent physicians to examine General Pinochet and not rely solely on the information provided by his physicians. Any refusal by General Pinochet to be examined by appointed doctors should weigh against a decision to return him to Chile on humanitarian grounds.     Human Rights Watch believes that a full and fair trial could be tremendously valuable in establishing a record of Pinochet's crimes, even if he doesn't serve a day in prison. General Pinochet should be therefore be returned to Chile on """"humanitarian"""" grounds only if there is a determination that he is not likely to survive the legal process. Having a long term-illness, even one which might eventually be fatal, does not exempt someone from criminal responsibility.    How have other tribunals treated ill defendants accused of crimes against humanity?     In four recent high-profile cases---the prosecutions in France of Klaus Barbie, Paul Touvier and Maurice Papon, and in Germany of Erich Honecker---perpetrators of crimes against humanity argued that they should be awarded leniency due to old age and/or ill health.     - The Vichy France Defendants: Barbie, Touvier, and Papon Pro-Nazi war criminals Klaus Barbie, Paul Touvier, and Maurice Papon were all of advanced age when their prosecution commenced; Papon was quite ill during the course of the trial. Despite this, none of the three was excused from standing trial and each was sentenced to terms in prison.     Klaus Barbie, the former Lyon Gestapo chief known as """"the Butcher of Lyon,"""" was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 at age 77 for his role in the deportation of French and expatriate Jews between 1942 and 1944. Barbie died of cancer in solitary confinement in 1991.     Paul Touvier, the former French militia chief and assistant to Barbie known as the """"Hangman of Lyon,"""" was tried and convicted in 1994 for ordering the death of seven Jews. Touvier became quite sick while incarcerated from prostrate cancer; his family asked twice for a presidential pardon. Both requests were denied and Touvier died in prison in 1996 at the age of 81.     Maurice Papon, who was convicted for ordering the deportation of 1,560 people while serving as secretary-general for Jewish affairs in Bordeaux from 1942 to 1944, was 87 years old at the beginning of his trial and had recently undergone triple bypass heart surgery. Before trial, the French court appointed two doctors to rule upon the state of his health. Based on their findings, the prosecution against Papon commenced. Due to Papon's poor health, the trial was delayed several times but it was completed and Papon, then aged 88, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on April 2, 1998. Due to his poor health, he was allowed conditional freedom pending his current appeal.     - The Honecker Case Former President of the German Democratic Republic Erich Honecker was indicted for thirteen manslaughter charges resulting from shootings by East German border guards. At the time of the indictment, Honecker was suffering from terminal liver cancer and was not expected to live more than a few months. The Berlin Constitutional Court released Honecker, reasoning that although he might be fit to stand trial, he was not fit enough to withstand punishment. The court wrote: """"A trial loses its purpose of handing down a binding judgment . . . when, with great probability, the accused will not make it to the end. The trial then becomes self-serving."""" The Court determined that the trial violated the human dignity guaranteed in the Germany's Basic Law because the defendant's punishment was unlikely to actually occur, making the trial appear to be an end in itself. Later, however, it was discovered that Honecker was not in the last stages of cancer, as the Berlin court appeared to believe. The lower court decision was subsequently overruled and it was ordered that Honecker stand trial. Honecker had already fled upon his release in January 1993 to Chile, however, where he lived until his death in April 1994.     As noted above, Human Rights Watch believes that, whether or not General Pinochet actually serves a sentence, a trial can serve the important purpose of establishing the truth about his crimes and provide a measure of justice to his victims.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

""""The Russian government is obligated to protect displaced persons, and must do so without discrimination,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Instead, Russia is sending Chechen refugees back to the very bombs they are fleeing. This exposes them to mortal danger, and is a gross violation of Russian and international law."""" The closure of the border exclusively to ethnic Chechens was first reported by the Russian television station NTV, and then confirmed by two other sources. A Dutch journalist who visited a border town near Bratskoe on October 9 told Human Rights Watch that he spoke to a group of about fifteen men who told him a similar story. The men also reported that police at the check point had solicited bribes of one thousand rubles (about U.S.$40) per male and five hundred rubles (about U.S.$20) per female to allow them through. The displaced persons said that they had gone ahead of a larger group of civilians to try to ensure entry onto North Ossetian territory. The size of the second group remains unclear, as Russian police ordered the journalist to leave the check point. The displaced persons told the journalist that Russian artillery had fired on them while they fled Chechnya along a road following the Terek river. They claimed they saw the dead bodies of fourteen civilians along the way. It remains unclear whether Russian forces intentionally targeted the civilians or whether they were caught in crossfire as Russian troops engaged Chechen fighters. Representatives of the Russian human rights organization Memorial, who yesterday returned from Ingushetia, told Human Rights Watch that on October 11, they interviewed several displaced persons who had also been turned back at the North Ossetian border. The displaced persons said they had been forced to travel back into Chechnya along the Terek river, where they were under artillery fire from both sides. After this perilous journey, they eventually made it to the road to Ingushetia and left Chechen territory. While the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia remains open for ethnic Chechens, Russia is still forbidding displaced Chechens from leaving Ingushetia for other cities in Russia, where many have relatives who could care for them. The refugees are being forcibly concentrated in Ingushetia, and conditions remain desperate with insufficient food, shelter, blankets and medical supplies. The NTV broadcast on Tuesday also mentioned that local authorities in North Ossetia neglected to provide sufficient aid to those ethnic Russians who were allowed to cross into North Ossetia. In reaction to this broadcast, the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service, Vladimir Kalamanov, expressed outrage at the inadequate care for displaced ethnic Russians, promising to correct the situation. However, Kalamanov evidently chose not to mention that ethnic Chechens had been turned back.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

""""This is a classic example of targeting the man to try to silence the ideas,"""" said Joseph Saunders, academic freedom specialist at Human Rights Watch. """"It does not bode well for the future of independent thought in Kuwait."""" Dr. al-Baghdadi, who chairs the political science department at the University of Kuwait, was sentenced on October 4 under Kuwait's Press and Publications Law to one month in prison. The conviction was based on an article he had written in 1996 for the university's student magazine, al-Shoula. In the article, al-Baghdadi contended that the prophet Mohammed had failed to convert non-believers during his time in Mecca, an argument that apparently angered some Kuwaiti clerics who faulted al-Baghdadi for improperly associating the prophet with failure. The action against the professor was the latest in a series of arrests of journalists, commentators, and academics for expressing controversial views on religious and political themes. The Academic Freedom Committee called for repeal of those provisions of the Press and Publications Law that allow for incarceration of individuals who peacefully express their ideas and views. Dr. al-Baghdadi, who suffers from a heart condition, was jailed on October 5, and immediately went on a hunger strike to protest his conviction and sentence. Four days later, he was hospitalized, reportedly with an irregular heartbeat. The letter also called on the Kuwaiti emir to immediately release al-Baghdadi and allow him access to treatment by doctors of his own choosing. The letter was signed on behalf of the committee by Jonathan Fanton, who recently completed a seventeen-year term as president of the New School University in New York, and by Hanny Megally, who heads the Middle East and North Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. In addition to Mr. Fanton, the membership of the committee includes internationally prominent academic leaders and scholars, including presidents of Harvard University, Columbia University and over a dozen other universities in the United States, and figures such as Krzysztof Michalski of the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, Ariel Dorfman of Duke University, John Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard University, and Fang Lizhi of the University of Arizona. A copy of the letter follows. October 13, 1999 Via Facsimile His Highness Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad Al Sabah Emir, State of Kuwait Your Highness: We are writing this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to protest the imprisonment of Kuwait University professor Ahmad al-Baghdadi, and to express our grave concern over his recent hospitalization. On October 4, 1999, the Kuwait Court of Appeal ordered Dr. al-Baghdadi, a professor of political science and chair of Kuwait University's political science department, to serve a one-month jail term for an article he had written for the university's student magazine, al-Shoula (""""The Flame"""") in 1996. In the article, Dr. al-Baghdadi contended that the prophet Mohammed had failed to convert non-believers during his time in Mecca, an argument that apparently angered some Kuwaiti clerics who faulted al-Baghdadi for improperly associating the prophet Mohammed with failure. In May, Dr. al-Baghdadi had been found guilty of blaspheming Islam in violation of Kuwait's 1961 Press and Publications law, but was given a suspended six-month sentence. The appellate court decision in early October, reducing the sentence to one month but ordering his incarceration, is not appealable. Instead of being permitted to surrender voluntarily, moreover, Dr. al-Baghdadi was forcibly taken from his home and into custody at Talha prison on October 5, preventing him from holding a planned news conference to protest the verdict. In prison, Dr. al-Baghdadi, who has a history of heart trouble, went on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. On October 9 he was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat. Dr. al-Baghdadi has long been an outspoken critic of the rise of religious fundamentalism in Kuwait and has accused the government of being afraid of Islamists. He has been a regular contributor to the daily newspaper al-Siyassa. Kuwaiti academics, journalists, and human rights activists have requested his release and called for suspension of his sentence. The government has declined, stating that the court's verdict was competent. The imprisonment of Dr. al-Baghdadi for peaceful expression of his ideas is the latest in a series of attacks on free expression in Kuwait. To the extent that authorities are now targeting campus publications, the case may mark a new stage in the erosion of freedom of expression. In June 1998, Mohammad Jassem al-Saqer, editor of the daily newspaper al-Qabas, was also sentenced under provisions of the Press and Publications Law to six months' imprisonment by the Court of First Instance for publishing a joke deemed offensive to Islam. In December 1998, Fu'ad al-Hashem, a journalist for the newspaper al-Watan, was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for an article in which he allegedly criticized the conduct of the Public Prosecutor. Khalaf al-Arbeed, an Islamist candidate in July parliamentary elections, was sentenced to six months in jail for slander of the government for statements he made at a political rally. Dr. al-Baghdadi's conviction and imprisonment under Kuwait's Press and Publications Law constitutes a clear violation of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (""""ICCPR""""). It also appears to contradict the Kuwaiti Constitution, which includes an explicit guarantee for freedom of expression. When Kuwait acceded to the ICCPR on May 21, 1996, it made a commitment to guarantee all individuals the """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds."""" This fundamental guarantee is directly contravened where, as here, a dissident faculty member is imprisoned for expressing his thoughts. The freedom to pursue research and scholarship unfettered by censorship and persecution cannot be separated from the freedom to exercise basic civil and political rights as set forth in international human rights law. As academic leaders committed to defending the basic rights of all members of the academic community, it is not our intention to support or dispute the particular opinions, ideas, or research findings at issue in the cases we work on. Defending the rights of academics to express their views and to study, research, teach and publish without interference, however, is integral to our work. We stand behind the human rights principle that peaceful expression of opinion, no matter how outrageous, should never be subject to criminal prosecution. To the extent that the Press and Publications Law allows for the imprisonment of individuals for the contents of their writings, it directly violates this principle. Imprisonment of individuals for peaceful expression can also have a devastating impact on society. We understand that a local paper quoted Dr. al-Baghdadi saying after he was imprisoned: """"I will leave Kuwait and live abroad, despite my love for her and her people."""" Loss of a recognized scholar and leader such as Dr. al-Baghdadi will have a direct impact on his colleagues and on his students. International experience suggests that, unless the sentence is reversed, the negative impact will be compounded by the chilling effect of his imprisonment (others will be less willing to express themselves openly in academic and other settings), and by the likelihood that his departure will be followed by those of other valued educators and scholars. For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully urge, at the earliest possible date, the repeal of those provisions of the Press and Publications law that contravene international human rights norms and law as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR. We also respectfully urge Dr. al-Baghdadi's immediate and unconditional release from prison. Finally, we call on the government to guarantee that Dr. al-Baghdadi be able to choose his own doctors and course of treatment for his heart ailment. Thank you for you consideration of this important matter. We look forward to your reply. Sincerely, /s/ Jonathan F.

At the same time, the report recognizes that Uganda had made significant progress in many areas of human rights. Although police and army abuses persist, the NRM has forged an army which is more disciplined than its predecessors. Uganda has also established a credible Human Rights Commission. But the progressive policies pursued by the Ugandan government in some areas of human rights protection contrast sharply with its policies in the political arena. """"Uganda has ended the massive slaughter of civilians which characterized the regimes of Idi Amin and Milton Obote,"""" said Bouckaert. """"The ruling party should not jeopardize these accomplishments by refusing to compete for votes in a free and open system."""" Since 1986, independent political parties in Uganda have been legally prohibited from carrying out many basic political activities. Political activists who attempt to hold public events are frequently harassed and arrested by police, and Human Rights Watch has documented many cases where police officials broke up rallies and seminars, occasionally through violent means. Civil society groups are required to be nonpolitical or face similar harassment. """"All kinds of groups, not just political parties, have been targeted for engaging in activities that displease the NRM government,"""" said Bouckaert. """"The ban on political activities is very broadly enforced to stop any perceived threat to the NRM."""" The NRM, now renamed """"the movement,"""" presides over what it calls a """"No-Party"""" system, but is itself virtually indistinguishable from a state-funded political party. The NRM has consolidated its monopoly on political power through exclusive access to state funding and machinery, widespread and sometimes compulsory political education programs, and an exemption from the stringent constraints placed on opposition political parties. Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the June 2000 referendum on Uganda's future political system, questioning whether a """"free and fair"""" referendum could take place in Uganda in the restricted political climate, and stating that fundamental human rights such as freedom of association, assembly, and expression could not be surrendered by majority mandate. """"The very purpose of human rights is to put certain fundamental standards beyond the whims of the majority, and to protect the rights of minorities,"""" said Bouckaert. """"Uganda's proposed referendum would put fundamental human rights up for a vote and that is unacceptable.

The closure of Neshat (Happiness) newspaper in early September is the fourth time this year that the courts have closed down a major independent newspaper that supports President Khatami's reform agenda. This closure, and the sentencing of Neshat's publisher, Latif Safari, to a 30-month suspended prison term, has again demonstrated the vulnerability of the press to politically-motivated attacks. Human Rights Watch today called on the Iranian government to replace the Press Law of 1985, which restricts freedom of press, with legislation that protects and upholds the right to freedom of expression. The Iranian parliament is currently considering amendments to the 1985 law which would, on the contrary, weaken its limited safeguards for press freedom. They would make journalists liable for prosecution in exceptional courts such as the Special Court for the Clergy, or the Revolutionary Court, where international fair-trial standards are disregarded.

Independent journalists were among those killed in a wave of political murders at the end of 1998, which created a climate of fear but did not succeed in stifling the independent spirit of the press. In May 1999, the government minister most closely associated with press freedom, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani, narrowly avoided impeachment by the conservative-controlled parliament. The report also describes the domestic and international legal framework within which the press operates in Iran. Sweeping language in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic qualifies and undermines the right to freedom of expression. The Press Law itself contains contradictory provisions and imprecise language which has failed to uphold the right in practice. In the absence of legally-recognized political parties, the press in Iran has taken on the role of mouthpiece for competing political interests. The struggle to control the press, described in the report, is in many ways the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole.

""""Dr. Hamarneh turned the Centre into one of the few independent social science research and training facilities in the Arab world,"""" said Jonathan Fanton, co-chair of the Human Rights Watch's Academic Freedom Committee, """"and it sometimes published information the government didn't appreciate. It is extremely regrettable that President Ma'ani did not maintain his original resistance to the pressures to oust Dr. Hamarneh."""" The letter urged President Ma'ani to reappoint Hamarneh to his post and to continue the university's support for the work of the Centre. Copies of the letter were also sent to King Abdallah and to Prime Minister Rawabdeh. The text of the letter, which was sent under the joint letterhead of Human Rights Watch and the Middle East Studies Association, is attached. October 6, 1999 Dr. Walid Ma'ani President University of Jordan Amman, Jordan By Facsimile: 962 6 535 5533 Dear President Ma'ani: The Committee on Academic Freedom in the Middle East and North Africa (CAFMENA) and the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee are writing to express our concern over the ouster of Dr. Mustafa Hamarneh as director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan. In the absence of any academic justification for his removal, we call upon you to reinstate Dr. Hamarneh promptly as the Centre's director. CAFMENA works on behalf of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, which comprises 2,700 scholars and teachers worldwide, to promote respect for the principle of academic freedom throughout the region. Human Rights Watch monitors human rights violations around the world. The Academic Freedom Committee promotes the right of scholars and students to express their views as citizens and to study, research, teach, and publish without political interference. According to information we have received, Dr. Hamarneh submitted his resignation to you on July 14, 1999 after being told that if he did not resign the Centre would be closed and its activities, including support for a number of Jordanians studying abroad, would be terminated. It is our understanding that in the period prior to this ultimatum, senior government officials including Prime Minister Abdur-Ra`uf Rawabdeh and Samih al-Battikhi, chief of the General Intelligence Directorate, urged you to secure Dr. Hamarneh's removal as head of the Centre. Upon Dr. Hamarneh's resignation, Dr. Salah Bashir, a member of the law faculty, was appointed as his successor. In keeping with Dr. Hamarneh's contract with the university, he initially continued his association with theCentre as a researcher. We understand that on or around August 23 Dr.Bashir dismissed him from that position as well. No adequate explanation of these developments has been offered by yourself or any other party. To our knowledge, no significant academic concerns were brought to Dr. Hamarneh's attention at the time he was pressured to resign. Our understanding is that research conducted by the Centre during Professor Hamarneh's tenure as director, as well as critical comments he has made as an independent political commentator and in his capacity as a private citizen, led government authorities to pressure the University to remove him. Dr. Hamarneh's ouster thus appears to have been based on political rather than academic criteria. At the time of his resignation, Professor Hamarneh had served as director of the Centre for Strategic Studies for seven years. Under his leadership, the Centre attained regional and international recognition for its research on policy issues in the Arab world, and for its use of scientific opinion polling and social survey research in Jordan. Several of the Centre's reports generated controversial findings, including a survey showing a decline in the popularity of the government of Prime Minister Rawabdeh; a 1997 report placing unemployment levels at 27 percent, ten points higher than official estimate at that time of 17 percent; and a 1998 study on public perceptions of Jordanian-Palestinian relations. In addition, Professor Hamarneh himself had acquired recognition as a specialist on Jordanian and Arab affairs, and his comments to the international media -- at least once misrepresented in local papers as insulting the dignity of King Abdallah -- are also believed to have contributed to pressures for his removal. We are gravely concerned that Dr. Hamarneh's exercise of his basic right to freedom of expression and his success in turning the Centre for Strategic Studies into an independent research and training facility — one of the very few in the Arab world — became the basis for his forced removal from office. As set forth in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Jordan is a State Party, freedom of expression """"shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers."""" Apparently, and unfortunately, it was just such activities that led to Dr. Hamarneh's removal. We find it profoundly disturbing that university officials apparently capitulated to government pressures and participated in Dr. Hamarneh's ouster. University autonomy is a precondition of academic excellence. In this instance we must concur with the views of a Jordanian legislator, who reportedly called this case """"a major blow to democracy, independent research, and academic integrity in Jordan."""" For the above reasons, we respectfully urge you to reappoint Dr. Hamarneh to his post as director of the Centre of Strategic Studies; to continue the University's support for the Centre, its work, and the students affiliated with the Centre; and to uphold the principles of academic freedom and university autonomy. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. We await your response. Respectfully yours, /s/ Jonathan F. Fanton Co-Chair, Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee /s/ Anne H.

Lon Phon is a member of the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) representing the province of Battambang. His abduction follows two recent arrests of SRP members and the harassment of others.   At 6:30 p.m., four men dressed in military uniforms seized Lon Phon from his home in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, and drove him off in a white Toyota Camry vehicle. The men were armed with three AK47 rifles and one pistol. Lon Phon's whereabouts are currently unknown. Cambodian government officials have publicly denied that Lon Phon has been arrested by state forces, saying that he was abducted by a gang of kidnappers. """"Given the pattern of state harassment of opposition members, the possilibity that the government was involved in Lon Phon's abduction cannot be ruled out,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"We think his life may be in danger, and we urge that every possible effort be made to secure his release."""" On September 2, Mong Davuth, a SRP member in Siem Reap province, was arrested, reportedly on the orders of the Military Court in Phnom Penh. He was flown by helicopter to Phnom Penh and imprisoned in the Toul Sleng military prison. A few days later, the houses of at least four Sam Rainsy Party members in Battambang province were surrounded by military police personnel. At least two of the houses were subjected to searches without warrants. One of those whose house was searched, Kong Bun Hean, a security officer at the SRP's Battambang office, fled to Phnom Penh. On September 13 he disappeared after leaving the SRP's headquarters in Phnom Penh. He was later confirmed as having been detained in Toul Sleng military prison on the orders of the Military Court. Both Mong Davuth and Kong Bun Hean have reportedly been charged with involvement in a September 1998 rocket attack in Siem Reap province. Government officials have alleged that the attack was an attempt to kill Prime Minister Hun Sen. There is concern, however, that the two men may have been falsely arrested as part of an attempt to implicate other senior opposition political figures in the rocket attack. Kong Bun Hean, according to information obtained by Human Rights Watch, was in prison on unrelated charges at the time the attack took place. Human Rights Watch is also concerned by the apparent misuse of the Military Court's jurisdiction in this case. In the Cambodian legal system, the Military Court is responsible for investigating military crimes committed by military personnel. Both of the arrested men are civilians, and the involvement of the Military Court in this case is clearly improper, even under Cambodian law. Human Rights Watch also notes that five members of another political party -- all senior army generals aligned to the FUNCINPEC party -- were recently summoned to answer questions over allegations that they were also involved in the Siem Reap rocket attack. Finally, Human Rights Watch expresses concern about the recent attack on the home of Nhek Bun Chhay, a former senior FUNCINPEC general who is now a member of Cambodia's Senate. On September 18, a group of armed men in military uniforms raided Nhek Bun Chhay's house and physically assaulted his wife. In light of these events, Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned by the abduction of Lon Phon, who, as a member of parliament, has parliamentary immunity from arrest. Human Rights Watch urges the government to mount a prompt and full investigation into the abduction of Lon Phon and to take all necessary measures to guarantee his safety.","Asia, Cambodia",""

These dangers have clear implications for protection of human rights, the paramount concern of both our organizations, and for the ability of the United Nations to oversee a successful decolonization process in East Timor.   The challenges facing East Timor are monumental. Virtually the entire population was uprooted in September, and those who were not forcibly expelled to West Timor will need basic humanitarian assistance until they can rebuild their homes and go back to work. Estimates of the physical destruction wrought by the militias and their army backers is staggering: the capital of Dili is in ruins; in the town of Aileu, only the church and police station were left standing, and the population of 17,000 is gone. Other towns, like Balibo and Maliana, are reported to be 70 percent destroyed and equally deserted. East Timorese, working with the United Nations, will need to replace many of the key admininstrative and professional positions held by Indonesians before the August 30 referendum, including in teaching and healthcare services. They will also have to build a court and law enforcement system that can lay the foundation for the rule of law in East Timor. No one knows how many people were killed in the period between the announcement of the referendum results and the arrival of the multinational force known as Interfet (International Forces in East Timor), but almost every day, new bodies are discovered and new information emerges about army-militia cooperation to destroy the place that is set to become the world's newest state. A essential precondition to successful decolonization in East Timor is a secure border with Indonesia and a population secure in the knowledge that the campaign of terror waged for so long by the Indonesian army and armed militias has finally come to an end. Significant obstacles remain. 1. The Danger of Partition and the Imperiled Position of East Timorese Refugees The first danger is a likely effort on the part of the army-backed militias to partition East Timor by declaring at least six western districts of East Timor a pro-integration zone. Those districts are Bobonaro, Covalima, Ermera, Liquica, Ainaro, and Oecusse (Ambeno), the East Timorese enclave that is wholly surrounded by West Timor. The zone would be controlled by the Indonesian army-backed militias now operating under a joint command as the Pasukan Pejuang Integrasi or PPI (Force of Integration Fighters). Key pro-integration figures, including the governor of East Timor, Abilio Osorio Soares, now living in Kupang, West Timor, and militia leader Joao Tavares, have made it clear that they intend both to mount a campaign for partition and that they will be sending militia forces in from West Timor to do so.1 Governor Abilio said in Kupang on 22 September 1999 that not only did he favor partition of East Timor as the best way to avoid a civil war between pro-integration and pro-independence forces, but that he had been meeting with officials in Kupang to discuss how to realize this objective.2 He and others claim that in at least three of East Timor's western districts--Bobonaro, Ambeno and Covalima--more than 90 percent of the people chose autonomy in the August poll.3 There is no known evidence to support such a claim, particularly since the United Nations Mission in East Timor deliberately did not count votes by district..) Tavares, commander of the PPI, said in Atambua on 1 October 1999 that some 6,500 East Timorese members of the Indonesian army and police were willing to join forces with the PPI to reclaim the western districts, and that any volunteers from elsewhere in Indonesia were welcome to help.4 In addition, Maj. Gen. Adam Damiri, the commander of the Udayana Regional Military Command, which includes East Timor, said if East Timorese soldiers wanted to join PPI, there was nothing the Indonesian army could do to stop them.5 It is not clear how strong the militia presence in the western districts is now, but the militias there were among the best organized and equipped, and their command structures in several subdistricts in Bobonaro and Covalima overlapped almost completely with that of the regular TNI forces. Interfet forces that reached two towns in Bobonaro district on 2 October 1999 reported encountering no militia resistance, but the potential for such resistance, indeed for the development of an armed pro-integration force operating in the western districts of East Timor, remains strong.  The fact that the militias have not been disarmed, retain considerable strength, and continue to be allowed to operate with impunity in West Timor with the support of the TNI, has implications for the security of returning refugees, for the implementation of the 30 August referendum, and for plans to replace the Interfet forces, operating under Chapter 7, with regular peacekeeping forces as early as November. With regard to the return of refugees, Tavares in particular has announced a plan to bring back into the six districts all the pro-integration refugees in West Timor, whether or not they came from these districts or from further east. This de facto partitioning, if allowed to take place, could have serious consequences for the political stability of an independent East Timor, but there are more immediate human rights concerns. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are deeply concerned about how the safety of those refugees, and indeed all refugees in West Timor, can be assured in East Timor, now that the Indonesian government has said that all 200,000 of them can return and a mass repatriation program could begin by October 6. Since so many East Timorese were forcibly expelled and continue to be subjected to attacks and threats from militia groups in West Timor, it is likely that many have claimed links to pro-integration organizations as a way of ensuring their own safety. It is by no means clear who is pro-integration and who is not, and the refugees must be protected from political labeling that could affect how, with whom, and to what areas they return.6 All refugees must be protected from having to register with any Indonesian agency, given the complicity between some local government officials in West Timor and the militia leaders who have free run of the refugee camps. There are already reports of refugees being paid by militia members to inform them of names of suspected independence supporters. Any registration process that involves compiling namelists that the Indonesian government could have access to is highly dangerous, yet this is precisely what is happening now. The social affairs office of the provincial government, based in Kupang, West Timor, began registering refugees today, apparently without international involvement, asking them to fill out a card with their name, other personal data, and their choice of returning to East Timor or staying in Indonesia.  The UNHCR has formally objected to this process, especially the question about whether they wish to stay or return home. In a press release issued today, the UNHCR said, """"Under the current circumstances, there is not even a minimum guarantee that the people can answer freely.""""7 Local nongovernmental organizations working with refugees in West Timor have sent us appeals, asking that this process not be allowed to continue because of the risks it poses to the refugees. They have also asked that any registration process, even by international humanitarian organizations, not be carried out until just prior to departure, so that the security of name lists can be further guaranteed.  It is vital that UNHCR and other international humanitarian agencies oversee the return of East Timorese and ensure that they are not subjected to militia intimidation in the camps while getting ready to depart, at the airport, harbor area, or land border as they are preparing to cross into East Timor, or at their ultimate destination. The humanitarian agencies, together with Interfet and UNAMET, rather than any Indonesian agency or security forces, must take responsibility for their safety once they arrive back home. Under no circumstances should armed militia members be allowed to accompany returning refugees home. The international community must ensure that the appropriate U.N. agencies are provided with adequate resources to support the urgent reconstruction of homes and provide sufficient levels of humanitarian assistance for those who decide to return. The ongoing operations of the militia forces, and the possibility that militias and their allies will attempt to pull the western districts out of an independent East Timor and """"reintegrate"""" them with Indonesia, make it imperative that the protection of the East Timorese people remain a central consideration in the transition process, and remain central to the work of both Interfet and the successor peacekeeping force. Confidence in the ability of the UN to ensure that East Timor not be left at the mercy of militias once again during that transition is essential to enable the East Timorese refugees and displaced to return home and begin the process of rebuilding their country. We urge you to ensure that the U.N. forces that will succeed Interfet have the appropriate mandate under Chapter 7 to handle the security problems that will arise. (Those forces are scheduled to replace Interfet as soon as the MPR ratifies the results of the August 30 vote, which it may do as early as October 14.) As one East Timorese human rights activist told us, """"The UNAMET civpols [civilian police] couldn't protect us from the militias before the referendum; they could only stand by and watch. The militias are just waiting to come back and kill again. Are the peacekeepers only going to be able to stand by?""""  2. The Danger of Continued Operations by the Indonesian Military There is no reason to believe that the Indonesian army's role in East Timor will end if and when the People's Consultative Assembly in Jakarta endorses the results of the August 30 vote, and East Timor begins the transition to independence. The army has pulled out thousands of uniformed troops, leaving behind 1,500 soldiers who will stay in East Timor until the formal ceding of Indonesian authority. But it appears to have left many soldiers behind in civilian clothes, including members of the special forces command (Kopassus), some ten of whom were captured by Interfet on 28 September.  Given the army's role in building up the militias throughout the year, there is little reason to believe it will abandon them easily. The evidence for the Indonesian army's having organized, trained, armed, and otherwise supported the militias is so overwhelming that the head of Indonesia's military intelligence admitted it freely to journalists.8 Kopassus officers took charge of the operation. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, """"Former military intelligence chief Maj-Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim, probably the country's most experienced covert operative, and two other senior intelligence officers are widely believed to have had a role in setting up the network.""""9 Zacky Anwar was appointed by Indonesian armed forces commander Wiranto to be the Dili-based liaison with UNAMET. There is less willingness on the part of the army to take responsibility for the """"scorched earth"""" policy, but published interviews with militia members and eyewitness testimony from refugees suggest direct army involvement, both in the forced expulsion of people into West Timor and in the destruction that followed. The regional military command that had been based in Dili, known as Korem 164 Wira Dharma, is planning to move to Ende, Flores, and many East Timorese soldiers have already appeared in Ende. Since there is no reason for establishing an army post in Ende other than to keep the old Dili command intact, there is concern that Ende, like West Timor, could become a center of pro-integration military activity. All this raises concerns about the proposed transfer of authority from Interfet to a peacekeeping force, all the more so when there is no organization able to fully take on policing functions. At the moment, the Australian-led Interfet forces have been able to arrest some militia members, detain them for up to seventy-two hours, then turn them over to the Indonesian police—who have immediately let them go. Despite international demands to arrest and prosecute the militia leaders most responsible for the violence, Interfet apparently does not have the capacity to put these men under lock and key, let alone prepare criminal prosecutions. They are thus able to remain a major threat to East Timorese seen as supporters of independence. This threat will only increase as more East Timorese, and more militia members, return home from West Timor. It will be the responsibility of a United Nations transition authority to train a police force, and members of the pro-independence armed opposition group, Falintil, may constitute part of that force. It will not be easy, however, to transform guerrillas into upholders of law and order, and it will be a long time before any reliable indigenous police force is in place. The numbers of United Nations civilian police and military liaison officers in East Timor are being increased to levels agreed to before the referendum, and the police will carry sidearms. But East Timor is not going to be a peaceful place for a long time to come. 3. The Need for Full Accountability Our organizations welcome the resolution passed on September 27 by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to establish an international commission of inquiry into violations of humanitarian law in East Timor from January 1999 to the present. We also appreciate the sense of urgency given to that process by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, when he asked that the High Commissioner for Human Rights appoint a commission and report back to him by December 31. It is critical that those responsible for the wreckage of East Timorese lives and land are brought to justice. We hope all members of the U.N. will give full support to the commission so that it can carry out its work rapidly, thoroughly, professionally, and with all necessary technical and logistical backing. As Amnesty International has noted in a letter to the Secretary-General, the commission should be allowed to travel to other countries to collect evidence and testimonies on human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law. We urge all states, including Indonesia, to guarantee their full cooperation with the inquiry, even though the government of Indonesia has publicy rejected cooperation thus far.  We also urge that Interfet, UNAMET, and the future U.N. Transitional Authority (UNTAET) be provided with clear guidelines and with sufficient resources and powers to collaborate fully with the commission of inquiry, so that they can provide protection and logistical support to members of the commission and those assisting them. They should cooperate in the detection and identification of the alleged perpetrators of crimes against humanity, as well as help to secure evidence that the commission requires, for example, by protecting and restricting access to massacre sites. The establishment of the truth regarding the crimes committed in the context of the consultation process presents a unique opportunity to assist the East Timorese people in building a new East Timor on the foundation of the rule of law and respect for human rights. It is an essential step toward peace and reconciliation in East Timor. Footnotes: 1. """"6.500 Soldiers Join Forces with Militias,"""" Waspada (Medan) October 2, 1999 2.

A Saudi national, El Sayegh was extradited to the U.S. from Canada in 1997 in connection with the 1996 bombing of a U.S. army base in al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. When the U.S. lacked the evidence to prosecute El Sayegh in its own courts, it began deportation proceedings, despite its obligation under the Convention against Torture not to return someone """"a state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture."""" """"The Convention against Torture was designed to prevent exactly this kind of extradition,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"The U.S. didn't have the evidence to prosecute him, but in Saudi Arabia he could be convicted on the basis of an uncorroborated confession."""" The order to deport El Sayegh came after Attorney General Reno said that the U.S. had received assurances that Saudi Arabia would not torture him. Reno did not make public the nature of the assurances, or say whether there were any mechanisms in place for monitoring. The U.S. admits it is aware of accounts of torture and abuse of detainees in Saudi Arabia, but says that detailed information is difficult to obtain because diplomats and human rights observers are not allowed into Ministry of Interior prisons were political detainees are held. """"The U.S. hasn't been able to prevent the torture of its own citizens in Saudi Arabia,"""" Megally said. """"How is it going to safeguard this Saudi national?"""" Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. to make the Saudi assurances public, and to stay the deportation unless and until those assurances include full protection from human rights violations. Those violations include torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment or treatment, including flogging, incommunicado detention, and execution by beheading. In addition, these assurances should guarantee fair and open trial with access for international observers, and frequent visits by counsel, family members, and diplomatic personnel. For additional information contact: Clarisa Bencomo (New York) 212 216-1232 The text of the letter follows. October 5, 1999 Attorney General Janet Reno Department of Justice Washington, DC By Facsimile Dear Attorney General Reno, I am writing you with regard to the case of Hani `Abd al-Rahim Hussein El Sayegh (A73 682 069), a Saudi national who was extradited to the United States in June 1997, from Canada, in connection with his alleged involvement in attacks or planned attacks against U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia. Your decision to direct Mr. El Sayegh's deportation to Saudi Arabia, based on assurances from that government, raises deep concerns on our part because there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture, grossly unfair trial, and could face execution by beheading if convicted. For this reason we are asking you to make public the nature of the assurances you received from the Saudi Arabian government, and to withhold deportation until those assurances cover the full range violations prohibited by the Convention against Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Punishment or Treatment (CAT). On September 10, 1997 we first wrote to you expressing our concern over Mr. El Sayegh's treatment if he were returned to Saudi Arabia, and asking you to make clear that the U.S. would not consider deporting or extraditing him to Saudi Arabia given that country's appalling and inexcusable human rights record. We cited evidence of torture of detainees, deaths in custody, grossly unfair trials, and the executions of four suspects in a 1995 bomb attack, apparently on the basis of confessions obtained after two months of incommunicado detention. In short, we described precisely the conditions under which the U.S.'s obligation under Article 3 of the CAT prevail: """"No State Party shall expel, return (""""refouler"""") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture."""" In reply James S. Reynolds, chief of the Justice Department's Terrorism and Violent Crime Section said that both the Justice and State departments """"are cognizant of their responsibilities relating to human rights issues, and such issues will be carefully evaluated in the event the point is reached at which they are pertinent."""" We were therefore disturbed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) decision on September 29, 1999 to deport Mr. El Sayegh to Saudi Arabia on or after October 6. The decision was based on your September 29, 1999 memorandum to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner. In that memorandum you state that """"The Secretary of State has obtained, and forwarded to me, assurances from the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that Mr. El Sayegh would not be tortured if he were removed there,"""" and that """"after consulting with the Secretary of State and taking into account all relevant considerations, including human rights practices in Saudi Arabia, I have determined that these assurance are sufficiently reliable to allow Mr. El Sayegh's removal to Saudi Arabia, and that such removal would be consistent with Article 3."""" The human rights record of Saudi Arabia deepens our concern about the sufficiency of the Saudi Arabian assurances. The U.S. Department of State's Saudi Arabia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998 admits the U.S. has received """"credible reports that the authorities abuse detainees, both citizens and foreigners. Ministry of Interior officials are responsible for most incidents of abuse, including beatings and sleep deprivation. In addition, there were allegations of torture."""" The report also reports great difficulties in monitoring conditions of detention and torture: The Government's general refusal to grant members of diplomatic missions access to the Ministry of Interior detention facilities or allow members of international human rights groups into the country hinders efforts to confirm or discount reports of abuses....[T]he Government does not permit human rights monitors to visit prisons or jails. The Government does not allow impartial observers of any type access to specialized Ministry of Interior prisons, where it detains persons accused of political subversion. The U.S., like other countries, has had difficulty safeguarding its citizens from human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. The obstacles to safeguarding the rights of a Saudi national from the Shi'a minority are necessarily greater, making it even more important the ensure that the assurances the U.S. has received are clear and substantial. Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the decision to deport Mr. El Sayegh does not appear to have taken into account other types of serious human rights violations he is likely to be subjected to, including incommunicado detention, grossly unfair trial, and punishments of flogging and execution. Again, the State Department Saudi Arabia Country Report details a pattern of serious violations against political detainees, including long term incommunicado detention and detention without trial, and closed trials, and notes that violations against """"Shi'a Muslims suspected of fundamentalist tendencies or Iranian sympathies,"""" have increased since the al-Khobar bombing. We are particularly concerned about the increasingly frequent use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, in contrast to the worldwide trend toward abolition of the death penalty. This year already eighty-five individuals have been executed by beheading in Saudi Arabia, a three-fold increase from the previous year. Although the U.S. does not take a position against the death penalty, its use Saudi Arabia, in the absence of the most basic fair trial guarantees, is a clear violation of the right to life. As government assurances are sometimes entered into the public record through court proceedings, we urge you to also make public the full text of the Saudi Arabian assurances in this case. Further, we urge you to stay the deportation order against Mr. El Sayegh unless and until those assurances include protection from the full range of human rights violations he may be subjected to.

""""The P.A. is using the threat of arrest and closure to silence its critics,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Every arrest sends a message, and that message is heard."""" In most cases the arrests and closures take place without warrants or written orders from the relevant agencies. The police may call ahead to say they have orders from """"higher up"""" for someone's arrest, or simply show up in the middle of the night. In at least one case, police told a human rights activist that President Arafat had ordered his arrest and interrogation after learning of an article he had written criticizing the Palestinian Authority's recent crackdown on human rights organizations. For further information: Clarisa Bencomo (New York) 212-216-1232 The text of the letter follows. 4 October 1999 His Excellency Yasir Arafat Palestinian Authority Gaza City, Gaza District Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch is deeply disturbed by the Palestinian Authority's repeated attempts to intimidate and silence journalists and commentators critical of P.A. policies, including by arbitrarily arresting or summoning individuals for interrogation and by closing down newspapers, television stations, and other media outlets. The detention by P.A. police of journalists Munir Abu Rizq of al-Hayat al-Jadida newspaper and Salih al-Na`ami of al-Risala weekly newspaper on Tuesday, September 28, 1999, and the subsequent detention of Fathi Subah of al-Ayyam daily newspaper and Wa'il Abu Duqqa of al-Jazeera Television on Wednesday September 29, 1999 is only the most recent of several actions taken against individuals exercising their legitimate right to free expression. In a press release announcing the journalists' release Police Chief Brig. Gen. Ghazi al-Jabali said that al-Na`ami and Rizq's arrests were actually """"summonses by the Palestinian Police to two journalists in the context of investigations that the police are conducting to discover the source that circulated false news aimed at defaming the Palestinian Authority without it having any basis in fact."""" Al-Jabali's account contradicts his statement earlier on Wednesday, when he said that al-Na`ami and Rizq had been """"detained since last night on a charge of spreading false news and defaming the Palestinian Authority."""" The characterization of the journalists' detention and interrogation as a summons is also brought into question by reports that police seized al-Na`ami and Rizq at their homes at night, and raided the al-Jazeera office in Ramallah before arresting Duqqa. According to the Journalists' Union, in no case was there a legal basis for the arrests and no arrest warrants were presented during the arrests. These arrests are part of a larger pattern of security force interventions to block free expression. In the last six months alone there have been at least two television stations closed and eight individuals detained, including the September 15 arrest of Maher al-Dessuqi of al-Quds Educational TV three days after he hosted a program in which a guest in a live interview criticized your policies; the August 5 interrogation of Eyad Sarraj, former secretary-general of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizen Rights, four days after the publication of his article criticizing the PA's crackdown on human rights organizations; the detention of three al-Risala newspaper editors two days after a May 20 story alleging police torture; the closure since May 17 of Bethlehem-based al-Ru'ah TV after it aired a play that security officials alleged incited prejudice between Christians and Muslims; and the almost three week closure of Hebron-based Amal TV on April 26, after it broadcast a program on corruption in Islam. With the exception of al-Dessuqi, all of the arrests and closures appear to have taken place without the issuance of the required search, arrest, or closure orders. In several instances police officers told journalists that they were acting on orders from """"higher up."""" In the case of Dr. Sarraj, high-ranking police officers specifically alleged that Your Excellency had ordered Dr. Sarraj's arrest and interrogation, and during the interrogation Brig. Gen. al-Jabali showed Dr. Sarraj a report to Your Excellency which contained excerpts from his article criticizing P.A. attacks on NGOs. Your Excellency has in the past frequently stated the PLO's commitment to abide by the obligations in international treaties on human rights. The right to freedom of opinion and expression are enshrined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: """"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."""" Your Excellency's continuing silence in the face of the serious violations mentioned above raises grave questions regarding your own acquiescence and approval of these actions. Human Rights Watch urges Your Excellency to act now to stop the continuing erosion of freedom of expression in the Palestinian Authority territories. This can be done by first declaring publicly that the security forces' illegal interference in the exercise of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression will no longer be tolerated and that those found responsible for such actions will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Secondly, as an indication of the seriousness with which you aim to stamp out such violations, you should order an investigation into all cases of complaints about undue interference by the security services in the exercise of free expression and ensure that anyone found guilty is duly brought to justice and the victims compensated.

These tactics, which include the banning of opposition candidates and censoring the media will taint the polls for the lower house of parliament, to be elected on October 10. In its report, the international monitoring group methodically documents how the Kazakh government succeeded in curtailing freedom of expression, association, assembly and the right to political participation in the run-up to Presidential elections held in January. Human Rights Watch says that the government has repeated these methods in the run-up to the parliamentary elections. """"While promising free and fair elections, the government used every means at its disposal to tilt the playing field,"""" said Holly Cartner, Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"It now stands poised to repeat this blatant manipulation in the parliamentary vote."""" The 39-page report, which is based on a fact-finding mission conducted in December 1998, details the various means used to silence independent news media, to thwart efforts by opposition groups to organize, and to prevent critically-minded individuals from standing for election. The report further shows how the government directed state agencies to coerce public support for President Nazarbaev, in violation of international standards on free participation and of Kazakhstan's own election law. Even before the announcement of early presidential elections in October, 1998, the government began actively obstructing the formation, registration, and activities of groups of citizens intending to organize support for opposition candidates or to participate in the upcoming vote as monitors. Amendments to the Law on Elections passed in May 1998 allowed the government to disqualify prominent members of the opposition from standing. Five privately-owned newspapers affiliated with opposition groups were fined on highly questionable defamation charges, subjected to specious tax audits, shut down temporarily or closed. """"Little has changed since the run-up to the presidential vote in January,""""said Cartner. """"The government is ‘allowing' some opposition parties and candidates to run relatively unimpeded, but is blocking those which most threaten it."""" She deplored """"continuing efforts to force citizens to support the government's preferred candidates.""""  Recent reports received by Human Rights Watch that workers in government institutions have been threatened with the loss of their jobs if they did not vote for candidates backed by the government are credible in light of the facts gathered during the presidential election campaign. Serious government harassment of independent print and broadcast media has continued unabated.

Russian air strikes in Chechnya, now a week old, have raised fears of a ground invasion and a repeat of the catastrophic 1994-1996 war, which cost thousands of civilian lives.  In 1994, the Clinton administration called the Chechen war, and the aerial bombardments, an """"internal matter"""" for Russia. """"The Clinton administration was slow to react to the carnage,"""" declared Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But much worse, Russia was never called to account for that massively abusive war. Instead, the international community heaped benefits on Russia during and after the war, because it wanted to keep President Yeltsin in power.""""  Since the new bombardments began, Western governments, including the Clinton administration, expressed some concern, but Human Rights Watch charged that in the past, concern did not translate into action. In the spring of 1995, several months after the bombardments, the IMF released a $6.2 billion tranche of a massive loan to Russia, after Moscow gained the strategic advantage in its breakaway republic. That summer, the European Union also granted Russia its version of most favored nation trading status. In January 1996, as the Russians were leveling the village of Pervomaskoe, held by Chechen rebels, the Council of Europe, an intergovernmental organization for the promotion of democracy and human rights, voted to admit Russia, abrogating its own human rights policies.  """"For the past few years, western governments have done much to advance the notion of international justice, supporting tribunals on crimes against humanity, war crimes and the like, commented Ms. Cartner.

Meeting with President Clinton Tuesday, Ecevit basked in praise for recent reforms and the Saturday release from prison of Akin Birdal, president of the Turkish Human Rights Association. At the same time, Birdal's organization came under renewed pressure in Turkey for its condemnation of recent prisoner deaths in the Ankara Closed Prison. On Tuesday, as Ecevit met with Clinton, Human Rights Association members were among some 100 people detained and mistreated at a public meeting in Istanbul, followed on Wednesday by a raid on the Association's Istanbul office and the violent arrest of one of its board members, Saban Dayanan. Dayanan was set upon by police as he attempted to read a press statement condemning the Justice Ministry's handling of unrest in the Ankara prison. Video footage shows police officers surrounding and kicking him. He told Human Rights Watch, """"They started to kick me on the floor. They dragged me to a van where four police sat on me. One of them closed my mouth. I was suffocating. Another tried to strangle me as they drove me to the police station."""" Dayanan was released without charge shortly afterwards. A medical report recorded injuries to his legs, back, and face. He made an official complaint to the prosecutor. On Saturday, three days before the Clinton-Ecevit meeting, Turkey released Birdal from prison where he was serving a one-year sentence for mentioning """"the Kurdish people"""" in a speech. (see HRW Press Release, """"Imprisonment of Leading Turkish Activist Condemned"""", June 3 1999), Steadfastly critical of human rights violations committed under one government after another, the Human Rights Association has been subjected to sustained official persecution since it was founded in 1986. Its offices have been closed and bombed. At least ten members have been killed. Birdal himself nearly died in a May 1998 shooting provoked by groundless government accusations of his connection to armed organizations and apparently carried out with security force involvement. Birdal's release from prison was a positive sign, coming only days after the recent releases of a number of imprisoned journalists as well as a renewed governmental commitment to curb torture. In a recent statement, State Minister for Human Rights Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik announced he wanted to """"strike a sound and honest communication"""" with non-governmental organizations, and with Birdal's Human Rights Association in particular.  """"We welcome the recent overtures by the Turkish government,"""" stated Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe & Central Asia division. """"But unless the government follows through with genuine change, we can only conclude they were limited gestures aimed at dampening US criticism during the Ecevit visit."""" Human Rights Watch has called on the Turkish government to achieve a number of concrete benchmarks of reform before a November summit in Istanbul of the 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which President Clinton is scheduled to attend. These critical first steps include: Abrogating all prison sentences imposed on people who express opinions non-violently. Releasing those imprisoned for their peaceful expression, including Esber Yagmurdereli, a blind lawyer imprisoned since June 1998 under the Anti-Terror Law. Abolishing incommunicado detention.

""""China's history over the last half-century has been marked by the designation of new ‘enemies of the people' and the rehabilitation of old ones,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"This anniversary should be an occasion to declare a general amnesty for all and to start the next half-century—and the next millennium—on a sound human rights footing.""""  To do this, China would need to do the following: Ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed in October 1998, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, signed in October 1997, and move rapidly to reform China's laws to bring them into full conformity with these two U.N. treaties. Overturn the official verdict on the 1989 pro-democracy movement; release those still detained for their peaceful involvement in it; and """"rehabilitate"""" all those convicted of nonviolent offenses related to the 1989 demonstration, including those forced into exile abroad. Institute a mechanism by which all prisoners and detainees convicted of """"counterrevolutionary"""" crimes or crimes against the state can have their cases reviewed by an impartial board, with a view toward releasing and rehabilitating all those sentenced for peaceful political and religious activity. Abolish the practice of reeducation through labor which enables individuals to be administratively detained in labor camps for periods of up to three years. Open all court proceedings to the Chinese public and to international observers, and add to the Criminal Procedure Law a provision explicitly guaranteeing presumption of innocence until proven guilty as recommended by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The Working Group visited China in 1997. Allow independent monitoring of the Chinese prison system by international humanitarian organizations. Proceed with efforts to make the judiciary more independent and free from political control. Some of the ups and downs of China's human rights performance since 1949: Over the last fifty years, the People's Republic of China has undergone at least four major policy shifts as officials tried to define a path toward strength and prosperity. Each of these shifts—in 1957, 1961, 1966 and 1978—has had major human rights consequences. Each has been accompanied by cycles of political thaws and chills, as internal divisions or external pressure came into play. Each has created new political victims, and each led to new arguments on rights. From 1949 to 1957, party policy was defined by class struggle, and class background shaped one's relationship to the state. Mass campaigns such as the """"three anti"""" and """"five anti"""" were directed against corrupt officials and the """"bourgeois"""" classes. Peasants saw some social and economic rights enhanced, particularly with the implementation of land reform, but political rights for all remained tightly restricted. During the short-lived Hundred Flowers Campaign, the government encouraged intellectuals to criticize the party, but the campaign was followed by the mass purge in 1957 of people who had been courageous enough to speak out. An estimated 100,000 alleged """"rightists"""" were arrested by public security forces and sent to labor camps. Rehabilitation came, in some cases, only after twenty years. The period from 1957 through 1960 marked a shift to radical politics, when Mao Zedong moved away from the Soviet model of industrial revolution and embarked on the Great Leap Forward. Government-sponsored mass campaigns whipped up popular enthusiasm for communalized agriculture and the creation of back-yard steel furnaces, and fear instilled by the 1957 purges muted any form of criticism. Local officials who witnessed the disastrous effects of these policies were afraid to report to their superiors for the same reason, and millions of people are estimated to have died of starvation as a result. This was one case, as economist Amartya Sen has pointed out, where lack of freedom of expression led directly to widespread famine. Politics turned again more moderate in 1961 when even Mao accepted the Great Leap's failure. Pragmatic leaders such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping tried to improve the foundations of """"socialist law"""" and downplayed class struggle. But the onset of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) spelled disaster for human rights. Liu Shaoqi, once president, was left to die in a house far from Beijing after being tortured. People with """"bad"""" class backgrounds were jailed in makeshift lockups called """"cowsheds""""and now shared their fate with high officials who had fallen from grace. The number of people killed or driven to suicide during this period exceeds one million by most estimates, and an estimated 16 million were forced into the countryside in the largest forced internal exile in history. The latest major policy shift took place in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping replaced the destructive concept of """"class struggle"""" with a new policy of economic reform. That policy shift has brought tangible human rights benefits: improvements in living standards, greater freedom of movement, some reform of the legal system and a move toward less arbitrary application of the law. It has also led to greater political participation at the local level with village-level elections, although how significant those elections are is a matter of ongoing debate.  But it has also been marked by at least four cycles of opening and repression, around the Democracy Wall movement, 1979-81, the 1985-86 intellectual thaw, the 1989 democracy movement, and the """"Beijing Spring"""" of 1997-98. China is now in the throes of the repressive phase of that cycle as officials are quick to crush any signs of political dissent or frontal challenges to party control. By arresting members of groups seen as posing such challenges, such as the China Democracy Party and the Falung Gong; by increasing controls on Internet access and other communications; by intensifying security in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia; and by cracking down on migrant workers, China is starting off its second half-century simply continuing the pattern of the past.","Asia, China and Tibet",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/09/30/anti-christian-violence-rise-india","Anti-Christian Violence on the Rise in India","Anti-Christian Violence on the Rise in India","New Report details politics behind extremist Hindu attacks","09/30/1999","(London) – The Indian government has failed to prevent increasing violence against Christians and is exploiting communal tensions for political ends, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released today. The 37-page report, Politics by Other Means: Attacks Against Christians in India, details violence against Christians in the months ahead of the country's national parliamentary elections in September and October 1999, and in the months following electoral victory by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party, known as the BJP) in the state of Gujarat. Attacks against Christians throughout the country have increased significantly since the BJP began its rule at the center in March 1998. They include the killings of priests, the raping of nuns, and the physical destruction of Christian institutions, schools, churches, colleges, and cemeteries. Thousands of Christians have also been forced to convert to Hinduism. The report concludes that as with attacks against Muslims in 1992 and 1993, attacks against Christians are part of a concerted campaign of right-wing Hindu organizations, collectively called the sangh parivar, to promote and exploit communal clashes to increase their political power-base. The movement is supported at the local level by militant groups who operate with impunity. """"Christians are the new scapegoat in India's political battles,"""" said Smita Narula, author of the report and researcher for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Without immediate and decisive action by the government, communal tensions will continue to be exploited for political and economic ends.""""  The Hindu organizations most responsible for violence against Christians are the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council, VHP), the Bajrang Dal, and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Corps, RSS). According to a former RSS member, these groups cannot be divorced from the ruling BJP party: """"There is no difference between the BJP and RSS. BJP is the body. RSS is the soul, and the Bajrang Dal is the hands for beating."""" A majority of the reported incidents of violence against Christians in 1998 occurred in Gujarat, the same year that the BJP came to power in the state. In April 1999, Human Rights Watch visited the Dangs district in Gujarat, site of a ten-day spate of violent and premeditated attacks on Christian communities and institutions between December 25, 1998, and January 3, 1999. The report documents patterns there that are representative of attacks across India. These include the role of sangh parivar organizations and the local media in promoting anti-Christian propaganda, the exploitation of communal differences to mask political and economic motives underlying the attacks, local and state government complicity in the attacks, and the failure of the central government to meet its constitutional and international obligations to protect minorities. Jamuna Bhen, a thirty-year-old agricultural laborer in Dangs district, told Human Rights Watch, """"The Hindus removed the ornamentation from our church on December 25 [1998]. They threatened us by saying that they will set the church house on fire. Then they started taking down the roof tiles…. There were one hundred to 200 people who came from other villages. They said, ‘We will burn everything.' We begged them not to. We said, ‘Don't do this,' and said we will become Hindu.""""  In January 1999, Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons were trapped in their car and burned alive in the state of Orissa, reportedly by Dara Singh, a local leader of the extremist group Bajrang Dal. On the eve of India's national parliamentary elections in September and October 1999, the situation for minorities in the state deteriorated significantly. In August 1999, Singh struck again, chopping off the arms of a Muslim trader before setting him on fire. One week later, Rev. Arul Doss was shot in the chest with an arrow and beaten to death by a group of unidentified assailants. The BJP charged the Congress-led state government with criminal negligence, while Congress sought to blame the incidents on the policies and activities of sangh parivar organizations. While communal tensions in the state were exploited by political parties on all sides, the main perpetrators of the attacks were still at large.  In a pattern similar to the response to organized violence against lower castes, the tendency is for local officials under pressure to arrest a few members, but not the leaders, of the groups involved. The communities affected represent some of the poorest in the country and include Dalits (""""untouchables"""") and members of local tribal communities, many of whom convert to Christianity to escape abuses under India's caste system. In many cases, Christian institutions and individuals targeted were singled out for their role in promoting health, literacy, and economic independence among Dalit and tribal community members. A vested interest in keeping these communities in a state of economic dependency is a motivating factor in anti-Christian violence and propaganda.  Though eyewitnesses have identified politicians and local officials as participants in the attacks, the state administration and Hindu nationalist leaders continue to portray the incidents as actions instigated by minority communities. The chief minister of Gujarat and BJP spokesmen have even blamed the violence on an """"international conspiracy"""" to defame the political party. The prime minister has called for a national debate on conversions, signaling tacit justification for the motives underlying the attacks. The central and state governments continue to ignore the recommendations of the National Commission for Minorities. Human Rights Watch called on the Indian government to meet its constitutional and international obligations to ensure that religious minorities may equally enjoy freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, propagate and adopt religion. In particular, Indian officials should commit to taking steps to prevent further violence and end impunity for campaigns of violence and prosecute both state and private actors responsible for the attacks.","Asia, India",""

""""This is not an issue of ethnicity or secession, as it was in Kosovo,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Milosevic and his inner circle are violating human rights in the Serbian capital to protect their own power."""" The Serbian government has used unnecessary force against street protests many times in the past, but yesterday was the first violence against this autumn's demonstrations organized by the Alliance for Change, a coalition of political parties united in opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Witnesses saw the police beat dozens of peaceful protesters, including young people and the elderly. Policemen wielded truncheons against people who were on the ground in a prone position, and clearly not offering any resistance. Others were beaten long after the protesters had dispersed. Between forty-five and sixty individuals sought medical care as a result of the beatings, according to the Alliance for Change. Journalists were also attacked, even after they had identified themselves as press. A correspondent for the independent Beta news agency and cameramen from CNN and SKY news were beaten, and the latter two had their cameras destroyed, according to the independent Radio Index. Yesterday's demonstration was one in a series of anti-government protests organized since September 21. An estimated 20,000 people intended to march from Belgrade's central Terazije Square to Dedinje Hill, an elite neighborhood where Milosevic lives. Around 9:00 p.m., the protesters were met on the corner of Kneza Milosa and Nemanjina Streets by approximately two hundred policemen in full riot gear. A police commander requested that the protestors disperse since """"movement through Kneza Milosa Street is not allowed."""" Alliance for Change leaders also asked the demonstrators to walk along another street in order to avoid violence, but most remained. During the forty-five minute stand-off between the police and demonstrators, three water cannons and three armored personnel carriers with automatic guns aimed at the protesters were placed behind the police cordon. Around 9:45 p.m., another cordon of police approached the demonstrators from Nemanjina St. and began to forcibly disperse and beat the crowd. A well known political leader, Pavic Obradovic, vice president of the political party Social Democracy, was beaten, and another vice president from the party, Slobodan Orlic, was arrested after the police intervention at the entrance to the party's office, two kilometers away. A member of the party's Executive Board, Jelena Milenkovic, was beaten by a policeman during Orlic's arrest. The police issued statement yesterday that a group of """"hooligans from the so-called Alliance for Change attacked the policemen who were performing their regular duties in keeping public order and peace... The hooligans used bricks, stones, and flag poles, injuring five policemen, three of them seriously."""" According to Serbia's Law on Citizens' Gatherings, marches must be announced to the police five days in advance of the planned event (article 6, paragraph 2). The police are then obliged to issue a response to the request; failure to do so is considered approval for the march. Vladan Batic, coordinator of the Alliance for Change, told Human Rights Watch that the Alliance had informed the Belgrade police ahead of the deadline for yesterday's march, but that the police had failed to respond. There have been other restrictions on the opposition parties' activities in September. The man in charge of the audio equipment for the Alliance for Change demonstrations, Nikola Djurickovic, was sentenced to seven days in prison on September 27 because he had not reported his private change of address to the police (from Berane, Montenegro, to Belgrade). According to media reports, he was released by an appeals court on September 30. On September 28, a member of the Democratic Party security staff, Aleksandar Stosic, was beaten by unknown individuals he believed to be the police as he placed posters on a wall in central Belgrade. The Serbian government has used violence against demonstrators in previous years. The police beat hundreds of people taking part in Serbia's last round of large-scale anti-government protests in 1996-1997 (see Human Rights Watch report: """"Discouraging Democracy: Elections and Human Rights in Serbia,"""" September 1997).","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

While Turkey's human rights record has improved, many abuses continue.  Yesterday, 170,000 copies of the newspaper Akit (""""Contract"""") were confiscated by Istanbul State Security Court, and legal proceedings were initiated against journalist Abdurrahman Dilipak for his """"Open Letter to Mr. Bulent Ecevit, c/o President Clinton, The White House,"""" which contained broad criticisms of the government, and in particular, the headscarf ban. The article contains no incitement to hatred or violence.  Torture continues to be widespread, and writers are still imprisoned, especially if they wrote about certain taboo topics such as the Kurdish minority, the role of the military, or of religion in politics. However, over the last year, the three or four most active illegal armed groups have reduced their attacks, and the biggest, the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), suggested it may abandon armed activites and may put an end to its fifteen-year war with Turkish armed forces. The Turkish government must now seize the momentum created by these developments to carry out far-reaching legal reforms and to implement concrete human rights protections. The question is whether President Clinton will capitalize on the positive environment to press for change in Turkey. In the past, the U.S. has put its strategic relationship with Turkey above human rights. Mr. Ecevit can already claim some modest achievements. After coming into office in May, his government's first act was to issue an internal memorandum which formally condemned torture and proposed that observers should make unannounced visits to places of interrogation. Earlier this month, a number of journalists had their sentences suspended and were released from prison, and just two days ago, Akin Birdal, one of the country's best-known political prisoners and president of the Turkish Human Rights Association, walked free. But these measures betray the same hesitancy and equivocation as every other government since the 1980 military coup. After the memorandum, Ecevit did not initiate a program of visits to interrogation centers, nor did he abolish the practice of holding people incommunicado - where they are frequently subject to torture. Last week, journalist Nadire Mater was indicted for """"insulting the armed forces"""" and faces a possible six-year sentence for publishing the memoirs of a group of soldiers who have served in the southeastern part of the country, where the Kurdish minority is concentrated. The military has been fighting the PKK, using brutal methods including the wholesale destruction of villages. The bans on publishing or broadcasting in the Kurdish language are still in place. Political parties with members drawn from the Kurdish minority, or from the religiously devout, have been suppressed. Women may not wear a headscarf in government offices, courts and universities, because it is considered a political statement favoring Islam. The Turkish military is not giving Mr. Ecevit much room to maneuver on these issues. The Chief of General Staff of the Turkish armed forces recently said the military would fight separatism and political Islam """"for a thousand years, if necessary."""" The military is still the overriding force in Turkish politics. Human rights problems are a live issue in the United States' relations with Turkey. Harold Koh, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, visited Turkey in August, and conveyed two priorities for human rights reform: implementing safeguards against torture, and reforming laws which restrict freedom of expression both for the religious right and for the Kurdish minority. This November, Turkey will host a major summit for European heads of state, from the 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Mr Clinton and Mr. Ecevit should make the Istanbul summit a deadline for the most pressing reforms, which include: Abrogating all prison sentences imposed on people who express opinions non-violently. Releasing those imprisoned for their peaceful expression, including Esber Yagmurdereli, a blind lawyer imprisoned since June 1998 under the Anti-Terror Law. Abolishing incommunicado detention. Taking steps to end the repression of Islamist political parties and parties representing the Kurdish minority.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Türkiye",""

But the group warned that the effectiveness and credibility of an investigation could be undermined if it were closely tied to the Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights, commonly referred to by its Indonesian acronym, Komnas-HAM. On Monday afternoon, delegates to a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva will vote on a resolution calling on the UN Secretary General to establish an International Commission of Inquiry. The resolution emphasizes that the International Commission should work in cooperation with the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights to gather information on """"possible violations of human rights and acts which may constitute breaches of international humanitarian law in East Timor"""" since January 1999. Komnas-HAM has a well-deserved reputation for independence in Indonesia but not in East Timor, where it is seen as having played a pro-Indonesia role, particularly in the months preceding the August 30 referendum. East Timorese witnesses to human rights violations by the Indonesian army or army-backed militias are not likely to trust investigators seen as being linked to the Indonesian government. It is therefore critical that any international commission of inquiry be seen as wholly independent of Komnas-HAM. """"We would expect the international commission to cooperate with a wide range of Indonesian and East Timorese human rights organizations,"""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch, from Geneva. """"But mentioning Komnas-HAM by name in the resolution suggests a stronger linkage, and we're worried about the implications."""" Human Rights Watch is also concerned that nowhere in draft resolution is the word """"investigate"""" used. Rather, the resolution merely says the international commission should """"gather"""" and """"compile systematically"""" information on possible violations. No explicit reference is made to the information being used for prosecutions of those responsible. One member of Komnas-HAM told Human Rights Watch that he and other colleagues who very much want to see an end to military impunity believe that the only way Indonesian perpetrators can ever be brought to justice is if the Indonesian government has a stake in the investigation process. Virtually all of the perpetrators, and some of the evidence needed to prove crimes against humanity, are in Indonesia, not East Timor. That political reality may be why the drafters of the resolution inserted a clause about cooperation with Komnas-HAM. But Indonesian officials, both civilian and military, have repeatedly denied any government involvement in the violence that occurred both before and after the August referendum. They have shown no interest in seeing justice done. It is therefore doubly important that any international commission of inquiry retain complete operational independence from the Indonesian government or institutions seen in East Timor as being linked to it. There has been much debate about whether the U.N. Human Rights Commission has the capacity to respond appropriately to a human rights emergency. If this special session of the Commission, only the fourth in history, fails to produce a viable investigative mechanism for a situation as grave as that in East Timor, the credibility of the Commission as a whole will be severely weakened. Komnas-HAM's record on East Timor is not wholly negative. In January 1995, for example, Komnas sent a team to East Timor after soldiers shot and killed six civilians in the district of Liquica. Komnas found that the six had been tortured before being killed and that the army had tried to prevent the families from finding out how their relatives had died. As a result of the investigation, two soldiers were tried and sentenced to four years and four years and six months respectively for violating procedures. But overall, the record has not been good. For example: In 1994, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions concluded after a visit to East Timor that, """"The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission was not the most appropriate body to deal with human rights violations in East Timor. Its mandate, means of actions and methods of work are insufficient. Furthermore, it is not trusted by the population of East Timor."""" Komnas opened its first branch office in July 1996 in East Timor. It was staffed by a former Indonesian prosecutor who did not speak the local language, and was located directly across the street from the district military command. As a result, it got almost no complaints from local residents. When the branch director was finally replaced, Komnas named as his successor an East Timorese who was an active member of Golkar, the ruling party, and who was solidly identified with the pro-integrationists. Komnas's activities in East Timor became highly politicized after President Habibie announced in January 1999 that East Timorese would be given the option of independence. On April 21, following two major eruptions of militia violence in Liquica and Dili in which several dozen people were killed, the Indonesian government announced the formation of a Commission on Peace and Stability (abbreviated KPS in Indonesian) with Komnas as the lead agency. Komnas members of KPS repeatedly downplayed the extent of military involvement with the militias and allied themselves with government officials against UNAMET.The fact that Komnas-Ham has been discredited in East Timor may have more to do with specific individuals than with the institution as a whole, and many members of Komnas remain committed to working for justice and accountability in East Timor. The damage, in East Timorese eyes, however, has been done.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice, United Nations"

Human Rights Watch called on the Justice Minister Prof Hikmet Sami Turk to ensure that units intervening in the current crisis use only that force which is strictly necessary to perform their duties and take all steps to respect and preserve human life. The group also recommended that the gendarmerie, which has a history of fatal attacks on prisoners should be pulled off guard duties.  Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch declared, """"It is inappropriate that assault forces should be used to guard civilian prisoners. To avoid further fatalities, the Justice Ministry should replace Interior Ministry forces for all guard duties in prison, including for intervention during crises."""" Official statements attributed the disturbance to the discovery of an escape tunnel by the guards, but prisoners' relatives believe that prisoners' protests at overcrowding sparked the intervention. At least one member of the prison staff was hospitalized. Tension is mounting in other prisons in Turkey including in Canakkale, Bartin, and two Istanbul prisons, where prison staff have been taken hostage during solidarity protests.

The gendarmes seem to view such prison unrest as an opportunity to settle accounts with prisoners who are alleged to have connections with illegal armed groups that may be fighting security forces elsewhere in the country.

An agreement between the UNHCR and the government of Indonesia is expected to be announced today. According to a UNHCR spokesman, under the agreement, the government of Indonesia will assure safety and access for UNHCR staff to the refugee camps of West Timor. UNHCR has agreed to embark on an information campaign to publicize three options for those who have fled East Timor: voluntary repatriation to East Timor, staying in West Timor, and resettlement elsewhere in Indonesia once the UNHCR has full access and is able to provide international protection for those in the camps. """"Security and humanitarian aid are the urgent needs right now,"""" said Human Rights Watch Refugee Policy Director Rachael Reilly, who pointed out that the refugees in West Timor are still at the mercy of the Indonesian militias and military that forced them from their homes. """"Many of the East Timorese in West Timor have been and continue to be terrorized, making it impossible for them to exercise anything like free choice as to where to go next. Meaningful choice will be possible only after militia members are kept away, aid workers have unimpeded access, and basic security and physical needs are met."""" Militias in West Timor are terrorizing the East Timorese, infiltrating the camps and systematically attempting to identify and retaliate against independence supporters. They have also assaulted, """"disappeared,"""" and killed those attempting to aid or shelter refugees. Indonesian authorities have also confiscated identity papers from those forced into West Timor. At the same time, army-backed militias continue to attack and expel persons from East Timor.  Fears that the expulsions are aimed at draining western districts in East Timor of independence supporters as a prelude to partition of East Timor were given credence on Thursday by former Governor of East Timor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares, who publicly called for the western districts of East Timor to be incorporated into Indonesian West Timor. The Indonesian Minister of Transmigration, Maj.Gen. Hendropriyono, announced on September 19 that all East Timorese in West Timor would be permanently resettled elsewhere in Indonesia within two months. According to the UNHCR spokesman, UNHCR has insisted on free and unhindered access to refugees in all locations in West Timor, that the nature of the refugee camps be civilian, that refugees have freedom of choice as to staying, returning or resettling elsewhere, and that the government prevent further forced displacement. Human Rights Watch said these guarantees were critical, and called on the UNHCR and the international community to elaborate them by insisting on the following measures before lending support to programs to resettle or return those who left:  1. Expulsions from East Timor and relocations of those already displaced by the Indonesian government must stop. Transmigration and resettlement efforts by the Indonesian government appear to be an effort to keep the displaced from returning home and shift the political balance away from independence in the western districts of East Timor. 2. The physical safety of those who have left East Timor must be secured. Militia members who are terrorizing the displaced or threatening humanitarian workers must be arrested and brought to justice, and free access for international humanitarian workers must be established. 3. There must be no forced confinement of displaced persons. Militias have tight control over camps in Atambua and the displaced have little or no freedom of movement. 4. All persons who were forced from or fled East Timor must be registered and provided with some form of identity document by international humanitarian agencies, such as the UNHCR, in order to facilitate return if they so choose. All registration lists must be kept confidential in the hands of international agencies to protect individuals from retaliation.","Asia, Indonesia","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Commission on Human Rights, meeting in emergency session in Geneva, to establish a high-profile commission of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in East Timor. """"It is imperative that the international community find out what has happened in East Timor,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"We know that terrible things have happened since the U.N. and international observers were forced out at the end of a gun two weeks ago, but we won't know the full extent of the crimes without a serious, professional, fully funded investigation.""""     The special session of the Commission on Human Rights, which opens today, will focus exclusively on the ongoing crisis in East Timor. It is only the fourth such session in the Commission's history. In 1992 and 1993, the Commission held special sessions on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and in 1994 on the situation in Rwanda. The current session follows a call from Portugal on September 9 subsequently endorsed by a majority of the Commission's members.     Human Rights Watch will call for the establishment of an Commission of Experts with a clear mandate and resources sufficient to conduct an in-depth investigation of the violence that has shaken the troubled region. The international monitoring organization is urging that the investigators be authorized to look into human rights abuses that have occurred since January 27, 1999, the date when President Habibie announced that he would give East Timorese people the option of declaring independence from Indonesia. The organization is calling for particular attention to the seemingly orchestrated violence and mayhem that erupted immediately following the UN announcement on September 4 that the people of East Timor had voted for independence by close to a four-to-one margin.     Noting that nearly the entire population of East Timor has been uprooted in recent weeks, the international monitoring group urges that the Commission of Experts be mandated to take testimony from witnesses and victims outside of East Timor as well as inside. More than one hundred and fifty thousand East Timorese are now gathered in camps in West Timor and reports suggest that many were forcibly moved across the border by Indonesian security forces and their militia proxies. Despite strong criticism from international observers, the Indonesian government has made plans to move many of these displaced Timorese to other islands in Indonesia further from their homeland.     Human Rights Watch is urging Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, to immediately appoint a team of international investigators with the highest possible qualifications in human rights and criminal law. To be effective, the Commission of Experts must work closely with the staff of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), who already possess considerable information on developments in East Timor, and must be assisted by full-time staff with country expertise and the necessary fact-finding, linguistic, and forensic capabilities as well as access to military intelligence.     The organization emphasizes that the goal of the investigators must be to determine not only individual responsibility for the abuses but command responsibility as well. Human Rights Watch specifically urges that the staff consist of full-time personnel -- not of persons seconded part-time from other U.N. duties -- and that it be directly accountable to a single chairperson who in turn will be personally accountable for the work of the investigatory body. Finally, Human Rights Watch is calling on governments to make voluntary contributions to fund the work of the Commission of Experts and to share intelligence information with the Commission to facilitate its investigations.     """"It will not do to have part-time bureaucrats running this investigation,"""" said Jones. """"We need full-time, experienced professionals who know the country, know how to uncover the facts, and who have the contacts necessary to look closely into military and covert operations and find out who ordered what.","Asia, Timor-Leste","International Justice, United Nations"

We urge the Commission to set up a formal Commission of Experts, composed of expert investigators and given the mandate and resources to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigative body should be empowered, as an interim measure, to report its findings to the Security Council and Third Committee of the General Assembly, and should be directed to issue a report to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.   An investigative body is urgently needed to clarify the facts. Important questions remain unanswered. It is not known how many people have been killed in East Timor. What we do know, however, makes it imperative that there be a detailed investigation to develop a full account of what has taken place in East Timor. We know for a fact that since January 1999, there has been a pattern of systematic and targeted killings of people suspected of supporting independence or of working with international agencies, including the UN Mission in East Timor (UNAMET). We know for a fact that since the September 4, 1999 announcement that nearly eighty percent of the population opted to reject Indonesian rule, virtually the entire population of East Timor has been uprooted. We know for a fact that tens of thousands of East Timorese have been expelled to West Timor against their will and face further forced displacement to other parts of Indonesia. We know that those displaced in East and West Timor are unprotected and on the verge of starvation. And we know for a fact that much of the physical infrastructure of East Timor has been deliberately and wantonly destroyed.   We believe the destruction, devastation, and forced displacement that have put almost the entire population of East Timor at risk would themselves justify an inquiry into the possibility that crimes against humanity have been committed by the Indonesian army and its proxy militias. We have the names of some people killed, eyewitness accounts of pro-independence supporters being stabbed by militias en route to or in West Timor, detailed accounts of militia attacks on some compounds where East Timorese had sought refuge in the days after the vote results were announced, and eyewitness accounts of the deliberate and systematic forced expulsion of East Timorese into West Timor. Many reports of massacres remain unconfirmed, in part because East Timor has been virtually cut off from the world since the end of the first week in September, and even today, after the arrival of the Interfet forces, there is no reliable information about what happened in the last two weeks in much of the territory.   The perpetrators of this violence must be held accountable and that accountability must extend to the most senior ranks of the Indonesian armed forces. This was no spontaneous eruption of anger by the losers in the August 30 referendum. Rather, there is strong evidence to suggest that it was part of a deliberate Indonesian army strategy to prevent East Timor from becoming independent. The main instruments of this strategy were the ostensibly civilian militias, composed largely but not exclusively of East Timorese, which were organized into a network with a political front organization in early 1999, and which were funded, trained, and equipped by the Indonesian army. Local police and army units were involved, both in supplying the militias and participating in the violence. Battalions 744 and 745 of the Indonesian army, which are about 70 percent East Timorese, were mobilized. Among the organizers of the violence was the military intelligence office based in Dili, known as SGI (Satuan Gabungan Intelijen or joint intelligence unit), and above it, the elite army special forces, called Kopassus.   The tactics used from January until the day the results of the August 30 referendum were announced were a combination of intimidation, harassment, and periodic armed attacks on suspected independence sympathizers and, from mid-June 1999, on UNAMET, international observers, and the press. From September 4, 1999, when UNAMET announced that close to 80 percent of the populace had rejected any continued ties to Indonesia, until the present, the army and militias have resorted to a scorched earth tactic that has left East Timor in ruins. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Places of refuge for the displaced in East Timor, such as schools, church compounds, and other public places, have been targeted. Buildings sheltering the displaced have been burnt to the ground, and those inside have been attacked. Tens of thousands of displaced people escaped to the hills to flee the violence, but others were picked up the militias. The militias reportedly have forced as many as 160,000 East Timorese into neighboring districts in West Timor that are wholly under Indonesian control, with the possible intent of ridding East Timor of pro-independence supporters and preventing their return.   What is the evidence for the above? Some of it is documentary, some of it is anecdotal, some of it remains confidential out of fear of the sources' safety. But some examples are as follows:   A militia leader named Rui Lopes from the western district of Suai told interviewers from an independent television channel in Jakarta that the day before the election results were announced he had taken part in a district level meeting at the house of the district head (bupati) in Suai. He said the bupati and the district military commander have orders that the militias were to burn down Suai, drive UNAMET out, and drive everyone into West Timor. He said the idea was to convince people that the East Timorese were not happy with the result and that UNAMET would be forced to conduct the poll again. He said that the militias in Suai were full of SGI (intelligence) agents.   Tomas Goncalves, another militia leader who fled to Macau following an anti-independence rampage by militias on April 17, 1999 that left between twelve and eighteen dead, told the South China Morning Post on September 16 that the plan to rid East Timor of all independence supporters had been hatched much earlier in the year. He said he had attended a meeting on February 16 in Dili, organized by the head of the SGI, which the heads of all thirteen district-level militias attended. Goncalves said the SGI head, an Indonesian colonel, told them the army was determined not to abandon its supporters in East Timor. Goncalves also told the Post that the colonel had received orders to hold the meeting from a chain of command that extended to Maj. Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim, the man General Wiranto appointed as his liaison in East Timor in April. Zacky was head of the army intelligence organization, BIA, until January 1999.   The Indonesian government, through the army, not only organized the militia network, but through other branches of the government including the Foreign Ministry, it organized and funded an entire political machine designed to get out the pro-integration vote. The political front for the militias, called the FPDK or Forum for Democracy and Justice, was founded on January 27, 1999, the same day that President Habibie announced he would give the East Timorese the option of independence. One of the leaders of FPDK was Eurico Gutteres, leader of the Aitarak militia in Dili. In April, after two militia rampages that resulted in dozens killed in Liquica, a man who has been the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's spokesman since the late 1970s, Ambassador Francisco Lopes da Cruz, formed a political organization called the Popular Front for East Timor (Barisan Rakyat Timor Timur or BRTT), designed to soften the image of the pro-integration forces. The FPDK and the BRTT, then joined with a third group to form a united pro-integration front, thereby giving an official imprimatur to the militias.   In July 1999 in Dili, Human Rights Watch interviewed a man from Covalima, Suai, who said that the militia in his area, called Laksaur, was led by an East Timorese named Olivio Mendota Morok, a civil servant who had formally worked as an intelligence agent with Kopassus. The Laksaur militia was based at the subdistrict command of the Indonesian army in Salele, Suai. ). On April 5, 1999, the witness had been captured by Laksaur members and brought to the subdistrict military command. He had been tortured in the front office of the command post by a Laksaur commander who himself was a former soldier, dishonorably discharged for stealing weapons in order to commit robbery.   In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, Bambang Wisnumurti, the chief of military intelligence for East Timor, openly admitted the military's role in setting up the militias. He said the rationale was that the independence movement was very well organized but the pro-integration side was not, and they needed help. The article notes that Zacky Anwar, """"probably the country's most experienced covert operative,"""" and two other senior intelligence officers were believed to have played major roles in organizing the network, and that Kopassus played a major role in infiltrating local army units and training the Dili-based Aitarak militia in particular. (see Dan Murphy and John McBeth, """"Scorched Earth,""""Far Eastern Economic Review, September 16, 1999.)   As the date of the referendum approached, members of the Aitarak militia-those with the closest links to SGI and Kopassus-began showing up in other districts. Human Rights Watch learned that Aitarak members showed up in Ermera on August 30-31, the night after the referendum took place and the UNAMET office came under siege. The homes of pro-independence supporters were systematically burned as army and police stood by. When one of those homes was torched by a group of ten armed and masked men, an occupant identified one of the attackers as Maj. Malachie, chief of staff of the district military command, Kodim 1637 in Gleno.   A member of the Aitarak militia named Mariano Cabral, interviewed by local NGOs in West Timor in early September, said Aitarak's firearms were provided by the regional East Timor military command (Korem 164 Wira Dharma) and that each member received a salary of Rp.300,000 per month plus 50 kilograms of rice. Cabral himself was an active duty member of the Indonesian army at the time he joined the militias.   In some cases, East Timorese people who had sought refuge in police or military commands in East Timor were later taken by militias to West Timor, to the towns of Atambua, Kefa, Soe, or Kupang. In some instances, this was voluntary, in others clearly not. There is evidence that the exodus to West Timor was a planned army operation. In Baucau, just before the evacuation of the local office of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) on September 7, the district military commander looked at the UNAMET local staff standing on the tarmac of the Baucau airfield and according to an eyewitness, said, """"These are IDPs, right? I have orders that all IDPs have to go to Atambua and Kupang."""" It was only after intervention by UNAMET international staff insisting that local staff were not internally displaced persons that the East Timorese staff were permitted to board the plane to Dili.   One NGO with observers on the ground has reported that the militias were deliberately spreading false information of imminent attacks by the pro-independence guerrilla army, Falintil, as a way of persuading people to leave in the days after the results of the referendum were announced. In Dili, militia members reportedly went house to house, seeking individual families, and ordering them to leave. The families were taken first to the Dili provincial police command and then transported to West Timor by military ship, airplane, or truck. All such departures are accompanied by militia, police, or army, and sometimes all three, and new groups of militia or police are on hand to monitor the arrivals in West Timor. In most cases, soldiers or police ask those fleeing to register their names. While the name lists may be necessary, as police claimed, to obtain social services from provincial government offices in West Timor, there is concern that they may also be used to keep track of pro-independence people.   According to Human Rights Watch sources, some 15,000 of the displaced now in camps in a district along the north coast of West Timor are from the tiny enclave of Ambeno, formerly Oecusse, a part of East Timor that is wholly surrounded by West Timor. Virtually all the rest of the displaced are from Dili and areas extending to the border with West Timor. Pro-Indonesia forces have stated they intend to retain control of these districts, and forced expulsions appear to have been a means toward that end.   These examples only hint at the volume of information available. With the proper resources, it should be possible for a commission of inquiry to document in great detail the full range of human rights violations that have taken place in East, and more recently West Timor; the immediate perpetrators; and the chain of command within the Indonesian armed forces that made the abuses possible. It will not be an easy task, however, particularly as the departing Indonesian troops and fleeing militia members may have tried to destroy evidence, and the traumatized East Timorese survivors of the terror may be fearful of giving any information that could put them at risk until their security is well and truly guaranteed. Even so, there is much information in the public domain and in the records of many of those who worked in East Timor from June to September 1999 that provide a good starting base.   On September 15, the Security Council, appalled by the worsening situation, condemned the violence perpetrated in East Timor since the referendum and demanded """"that those responsible for such acts be brought to justice.""""   The first and urgently needed step towards accountability is solid documentation of the human rights crimes that have been committed. Several important efforts in this regard are already underway, including information-gathering by UNAMET and refugee interviews by the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists. But only a mechanism with the proper mandate and the necessary resources will be able to adequately coordinate and conduct the wide-ranging investigation that will be required to determine both individual and command responsibility for these tragic events. Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the Commission on Human Rights to establish an impartial Commission of Experts to investigate the violence that has been perpetrated against the people of East Timor since January 27, 1999, the date when President Habibie announced that he would give East Timorese the option of declaring independence from Indonesia.   The Commission of Experts should be mandated to collect testimony in all areas where witnesses and victims may be located, whether they are currently within or outside East Timor. It should be empowered to begin its work immediately in order that critical evidence not be lost, and be directed to work in close communication and cooperation with UNAMET. It should be asked to report its findings directly to the Third Committee of the General Assembly and to the Security Council, and to submit a final report to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.   We urge the Commission on Human Rights to call on all Member States to cooperate with the Commission of Experts by providing all information in their possession. This should include military intelligence information in the possession of governments.   The High Commissioner should be asked to immediately appoint Commissioners with the highest qualifications in human rights and criminal law. It is essential that the Commission of Experts be assisted by full-time staff with country expertise and the necessary fact-finding, linguistic, forensic, and military intelligence capabilities to determine not only individual responsibility for these abuses but command responsibility as well. The staff should consist of full-time personnel, not of persons seconded part-time from other U.N. duties, and it should be directly accountable to a single chairperson who in turn will be personally accountable for the work of the Commission.   It is critical that the Commission of Experts have the resources necessary to carry out its task. In addition to money from the regular U.N. budget, states should be encouraged to make voluntary contributions. We urge the Commission on Human Rights to call on all states to contribute financially to ensure the success of this endeavor.","Asia, Timor-Leste","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/09/22/statement-small-arms-proliferation-un-security-council","Statement on Small Arms Proliferation UN Security Council","Statement on Small Arms Proliferation, UN Security Council","By Loretta Bondi, Advocacy Coordinator","09/22/1999","Thank you Mr. Foreign Minister [of the Netherlands] for inviting me to this briefing, thank you Eugénia [Piza-Lopez of International Alert, who chaired the briefing]. Ladies and gentlemen. Most of you, I am sure, have come across the horrors of small arms proliferation and misuse. In disaster after disaster, from Rwanda to East Timor, you have reported, as we have, indiscriminate attacks against civilians, and about entire communities destroyed and terrorized at gun-point. I should say small gun-point because, as you know, small arms and light weapons are the instruments most frequently brandished to commit abuses around the world. When you buy a chicken, this transaction carries no consequence: you pay the money, you get the bird. In some parts of Africa, however, a chicken may be bartered for an assault rifle. In this transaction, chances are that someone ultimately will suffer. Usually this someone is not a party to the trade, as survivors of conflict in Sierra Leone, for example, or the hundreds of thousands of refugees from Sudan and Angola would tell you. Yet small arms and light weapons have been for too long the Cinderella of debates on how to curb weapons proliferation and the abuses it engenders. Nongovernmental organizations around the world came to recognize the perils of this omission. To address this, we have formed the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA). IANSA's aim is to curb the proliferation, availability, and misuse of small arms. The complexity of this problem has brought together a variety of NGOs. In IANSA you will find participants from the North and the South, from the human rights to the humanitarian relief communities; from development to victims assistance organizations; from domestic gun control to conflict prevention groups. At the moment, there are 200 of us. Keep counting because we started only a year ago. Our network may be young, but each of us has a wealth of experience to offer. Some of us have documented the abuses facilitated by small arms, some others have been active in weapons destruction programs, others yet have been engaged in peacebuilding programs and in public health delivery. This is because small arms have affected all these aspects of people's lives. We know that the task ahead of us is daunting. But we believe that IANSA is part of the answer. The other part is the role played by governments and international organizations such as the U.N. IANSA members have engaged individual governments and legislators because governments are ultimately responsible for the arms they transfer themselves or that are traded commercially. They are responsible for putting in place controls that would preclude abusers around the world from receiving weapons. They are responsible for the security of their stockpiles. They are responsible for the actions of their nationals. They are responsible for what transits through their territories. The victims and the NGO community have been advocating for years the exercise of such responsibility and will continue to do so. They have not been alone: a U.N. panel of experts on small arms has also exhorted U.N. member states to exercise restraint in small arms transfers. Yet the members of the U.N. security council are still responsible for 85% of arms exports in the world many of which go to human rights abusers. The same panel has noted in a recent report, for example, that the U.N. collectively has been affected by the consequences of the widespread misuse of small arms in all aspects of its work. The Security Council debate tomorrow will offer an excellent opportunity to test the political will of the world's most important body to address the scourge of small arms abuse. The Presidency of the Netherlands has lined up a number of important issues for the Security Council's consideration. These issues need to be debated yes, but scream for action. Implementation of arms embargoes is one of them. U.N. member states have often supplied weapons to human rights abusers in defiance of the security council's will. This has happened virtually every time a U.N. arms ban has entered into force. When caught on the scene and exposed, these member states knew that their actions would go unpunished anyway. If the communal U.N. will were to be respected, surely mechanisms to implement and enforce arms embargoes must be put in place. States have also often acted by proxy and allowed the mushrooming of private actors—brokers, transportation agents, and the like—who are only too eager to carry out covert deals on behalf of government patrons and reap handsome profits in the process. Some of the graduates of the covert trade have continued to keep their pipelines running for subsequent conflicts. These shadowy characters, too, have basked in impunity. Currently there are very few governments that regulate the activities of these middlemen. As the illegal arms trade, too, has gone global, governments should wake up to this reality and make sure that those who deal with human rights abusers in violation of national arms trade controls and embargoes are exposed, tracked across national borders, and punished. The Dutch Presidency of the Security Council has reminded us that programs for the disarmament and reintegration of former combatants should be another priority for the Security Council. We could not agree more because this is an important way of preventing the recirculation of weapons and future abuse. We hope that wealthy council members will be willing to put their money and expertise where their mouth is. We also hope that this commitment will be sustained. It is when the spotlight turns away from a conflict and donor fatigue sets in, that we see the emergence of roaming armed bands of ex-combatants terrorizing civilians. Finally, the Security Council will debate tomorrow what should be done at the U.N. conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects that will be held in the year 2001. This may be a momentous event for the new millennium or may turn out to be yet another well-intended but inconsequential exercise in rhetoric. To avoid the latter outcome, I have a suggestion: the Security Council should take the lead in making sure that the conference will give the participants the go ahead to negotiate agreements that will bind governments to act responsibly in their arms transfers. Such agreements would give notice to human rights abusers that the arms pipelines are drying up. We have no illusion that the trade in small arms can be drastically reduced fast. But we must also remember that forces engaged in armed conflict do not just receive military support when they receive weapons. They also receive a signal that whatever they are doing is okay and that the international community is closing an eye to their abuses. Thank you.","Europe/Central Asia, Netherlands, Global","Arms"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/09/21/arrests-activists-malaysia","Arrests of Activists in Malaysia","Arrests of Activists in Malaysia","","09/21/1999","(New York)-- Human Rights Watch today expressed concern over the arrests since Sunday of at least eleven human rights activists and opposition figures in Kuala Lumpur. The arrests followed a major demonstration on Sunday in support of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The international monitoring organization urged that all those detained solely for the exercise of the right to peaceable assembly be released. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir will arrive in the United States next week. """"The government appears to be closing off public space to critical voices,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We are concerned that these arrests could signal a further deterioration of the human rights climate in Malaysia."""" The arrests took place following a protest in which a crowd of nearly 10,000 people gathered at the National Mosque to demand an independent investigation into allegations that Anwar was poisoned with arsenic while in prison. It was the largest public protest in Malaysia this year and one of the largest demonstrations since Anwar was arrested in September 1998. When the crowd sought to march from the mosque to the National Palace to deliver its petition calling for the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry, police fired tear gas and a chemical-laced water cannon; some demonstrators were beaten with batons. Some protestors retaliated by throwing stones and flower pots, and several policemen were reportedly injured. Prominent human rights activists and opposition figures are among those being detained. Detainees include Sivarasa Rasiah,a leading human rights lawyers in Malaysia and a founder of the human rights organization Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM), and Tian Chua, vice-president of the National Justice Party (Parti Keadilan Nasional) led by Anwar's wife. Also arrested were Hishamuddin Rais, Azmin Ali, Dr. Mohammad Hatta bin Ramli, Mohammad Ezam Mohammad Nor, Helmi bin Muhammad, Saidin bin Nayan, Dr. Badrul Amin Baharon, and Syed Bunyamin. Some of the detainees already have been charged and others are being held without charge pending further investigation pursuant to a provision of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code which allows for such detention for up to 15 days. During the past year, the Malaysian government has repeatedly broken up peaceful opposition demonstrations and public meetings. Rallies in support of the reform movement spearheaded by Anwar and demonstrations protesting his arrest and detention have been effectively banned. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested; Tian Chua has now been arrested four times in the past year. In silencing the protests, the government has variously argued that the organizers lacked a permit, that they were endangering security, or that they were not lawfully registered. In past cases, the government has also cited an October 5, 1998 court ruling banning any discussion suggesting Anwar's guilt or innocence prior to the conclusion of court proceedings. Those who have already been charged among the current group of detainees have been charged under section 27 of the Police Act (illegal assembly) and section 147 of the Penal Code (causing a riot) -- broadly worded provisions that critics assert can be and are used to obtain convictions even when there is no evidence that the defendant was involved in violent acts or otherwise posed a direct threat to public order. The fact that the government has used so many different reasons suggests that it is more concerned about the content of the message delivered in these public gatherings than the procedures followed by the organizers. The crackdown on public assemblies has not been limited to pro-Anwar rallies, but also has included other demonstrations critical of government policies, including the arrest in July of Irene Fernandez and other activists who were peaceably protesting the government's demolition of Kampung Sungai Nipah, an urban squatter settlement.","Asia, Malaysia",""

According to local activists, a confrontation between youths and security forces on September 9, in which a soldier may have been killed, led to indiscriminate retaliatory attacks on youths in Yenagoa and surrounding areas, in which an unknown number of people were shot and summarily executed by soldiers. Several tens of people, including women and children as well as young men, are feared dead.  In a letter of concern to President Olusegun Obasanjo, Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, called for an independent judicial inquiry into the disturbances, and for those found responsible for abuses to be brought to justice. """"The recent events fall into a pattern of indiscriminate violence by security forces operating in the delta,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Early this year, soldiers killed as many as 200 youths who were protesting the terms of oil production in the delta. The new civilian government seems prepared to use the same methods as the military."""" Human Rights Watch also expressed concern at a Nigerian police document it has received, which refers to groups operating in the delta, including human rights groups, as """"enemy forces.""""

It is our understanding that a confrontation took place on September 9 and 10 between youths and soldiers posted in Yenagoa since late last year. During these disturbances and over subsequent days soldiers shot dead several tens of people, some of them youths involved in disturbances who were summarily executed, others residents of the """"Black Market"""" area of Yenagoa. Security force members subsequently torched the Black Market, destroying homes and traders' stalls. The area has since been partially bulldozed. A large number of soldiers are still posted at Yenagoa, and a machine gun remains mounted on the waterside, where it has been all year.   While the sequence of events is unclear, reports received by Human Rights Watch indicate that some local youths had been causing trouble by extorting money from travelers, and were handed over to the police by members of the local branch of the Movement for the Survival of the Ijaw Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND), after which they were charged to court. Some of the troublemakers had, it is reported, previously been hired as supporters by Governor Alamieyesegha during his election campaign. However, other youths believed that they should not be charged, and protested at their detention. In the confrontation that ensued between the security forces and youths, one or two soldiers and youths were reportedly killed. Subsequently, in retaliation for the deaths of their colleagues, soldiers rounded up youths in Yenagoa and its neighboring communities arbitrarily, shooting several dead, and arresting others. They also went to the Black Market area and shot at people living there, including women and children fleeing the violence by trying to swim the nearby river. There are also credible reports that some youths who had been arrested and were to be taken to Ahoada police station to be detained were in fact summarily executed while traveling to Ahoada and their corpses discarded in the river.   While there are clearly problems related to law and order in the Niger Delta, indiscriminate retaliation by the security forces following confrontations with protesters can only fuel the discontent with the government and render a peaceful solution to the problems of the oil producing areas more unlikely. The recent events repeat in many respects a crackdown on protests organized by the Ijaw Youth Council in Yenagoa and its environs in late December 1998 and early January 1999, in which up to 200 people may have been killed by the security forces. Human Rights Watch published a report on these incidents, """"Crackdown in the Niger Delta,"""" of which copies were sent to the government at that time (further copies can be made available). The recent events unfortunately indicate that the current civilian government is prepared to use the same methods as the previous military one to suppress dissent.   Human Rights Watch welcomes the announcement by Director of Defence Information Col. Godwin Ugbo that there will be an internal army investigation into these incidents, but we call on you to appoint in addition an independent and public judicial inquiry, which should also have a mandate to inquire into the events of earlier this year. Those found responsible for abuses should be disciplined or charged with appropriate offenses and brought promptly to court.   We are also very disturbed by a document made available to us which is apparently an """"Operation Order"""" issued by the state headquarters of the Nigeria police in Port Harcourt, Rivers State and sent to police commissioners and other police officials in the delta area. The order is dated August 18 and headed """"Contingency Plans to Contain Activities of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) and other Interest Groups."""" It refers to an alleged IYC plan for an """"Operation Total Closure of Flow Stations"""" due to commence on August 27. While the document warns that """"hoodlums and other undesirable elements will take advantage of the situation to cause pandemonium and unleash their nefarious activities on the innocent citizens,"""" it describes the IYC, MOSIEND, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), the Ijaw National Congress, human rights groups, and """"criminals of all descriptions,"""" equally and indiscriminately as """"enemy forces.""""   Once again, Human Rights Watch is concerned that all those from the delta region who are unhappy at government and oil company activities in the area and make their voices known are targeted as the """"enemy."""" If individuals have committed criminal offenses they should be arrested and charged with those offenses. If there is a well-founded fear of public disorder, proper measures for the maintenance of law and order in line with international standards are legitimate. However, under international law and Nigeria's constitution individuals have a right to freedom of association, assembly and expression, even if the views expressed are unacceptable to the government.

""""Moving the displaced to other parts of Indonesia is not the answer,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The answer is allowing international agencies to get them food, water and medical supplies and arresting the militia leaders who are terrorizing them."""" She said the displaced will undoubtedly be asked to choose between staying in appallingly overcrowded camps controlled by militias or being moved to another island. """"That's no choice,"""" she said. """"It's just a way of trying to ensure these people never go back to East Timor."""" Human Rights Watch called on the Indonesian government to end any involvement of the Transmigration Ministry in relief efforts in West Timor, to end all restrictions on access to the displaced by international humanitarian agencies, to arrest militia members responsible for intimidation of the displaced, and to work with the multinational force in East Timor to establish a safe corridor from West to East Timor, so that the displaced can safely return when conditions permit. The Indonesian government is arguing that inadequate facilities in West Timor for some 150,000 East Timorese who have arrived there since August 30 makes resettlement to Irian Jaya, the Moluccas, and other islands in Indonesia the only realistic option. In a statement on Sunday, the Minister of Transmigration, Maj.Gen. Hendropriyono, announced that all East Timorese in West Timor would be moved to permanent resettlement sites within two months.  There is no question that facilities housing the displaced in West Timor are severely overcrowded, with inadequate food, medical supplies, and sanitation facilities. Some 98,000 East Timorese are packed into schools and churches in the districts of Belu and North Central Timor alone, with most of the rest in camps in and around the city of Kupang.  """"The thousands of East Timorese in West Timor are in danger from the militias, from lack of food and medicine, and from the Ministry of Transmigration,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The arrival of Interfet forces in Dili must not divert attention from a deteriorating security situation in West Timor and the possibility of further forced displacement."""" Interfet is the acronym for the International Force for East Timor. According to Human Rights Watch sources, some 15,000 of the displaced now in camps in a district along the north coast of West Timor are from the tiny enclave of Ambeno, formerly Oecusse, a part of East Timor that is wholly surrounded by West Timor.Virtually all the rest of the displaced are from Dili and areas extending to the border with West Timor. Pro-Indonesia forces have stated they intend to retain control of these districts, and forced expulsions appear to have been a means toward that end. Indonesia's highly controversial transmigration program, started under Indonesia's first president Sukarno and intensified under Soeharto, was initially conceived as a way of easing overcrowding on the densely populated islands of Java and Bali. The official rationale for the program changed in the 1980's from easing overcrowding to developing more remote islands, but it always had a political component as well. Transmigration Minister Hendropriyono is an army intelligence officer originally from the army special forces, Kopassus, who sees transmigration as a way of preserving the unity and security of Indonesia by encouraging intermixing of ethnic groups. His plans for the transmigration of displaced East Timorese are almost certainly motivated by factors other than humanitarian need. In late September 1998, Minister Hendropriyono announced a new transmigration pilot program in Aceh and Irian Jaya, two provinces with armed insurgencies and strong popular support for independence. He said the aim of the projects was to move non-indigenous groups into these areas so that there would be a mixing of religions and ethnicities, thereby strengthening a sense of Indonesian unity. He was quoted in a leading Jakarta daily at the same time that he was creating a new security system for transmigration sites through the formation of """"militant"""" civilian militias called perlawanan rakyat or Wanra, people's resistance. (See """"Irja dan DI Aceh Pilot Proyek,"""" Suara Pembaruan, September 23, 1998).  When the Indonesian army was accused of arming civilian militias in East Timor in February 1999, the army commander for the region that includes Dili said that the only groups receiving arms were members of Wanra and that these auxiliaries had existed in East Timor since 1978. Minister Hendropriyono was also associated with an effort in February 1999, after President Habibie's announcement that he would give East Timorese the option of independence, to move more transmigrants from other islands into East Timor. At the time, he said, """"Those who wish to see East Timor become independent are only a very few."""" He also said that it was clear that over twenty-three years, transmigrants from Java and Bali had been integrated very well into East Timor. In the same interview (see """"Timtim Masih Terbuka Tempung Transmigrant Baru,"""" Surabaya Post, February 15, 1999), he noted that there were 9,250 transmigrant families in East Timor at the time, meaning about 45,000 people. That figure would not have included non-Timorese civil servants or migrants who moved to East Timor on their own and not through the government program. The transmigration minister is now saying that prior to the exodus in early September, his ministry prepared resettlement areas for 100,000 people, and that with the vastly greater numbers of people, the transmigration program must be speeded up (see """"102 Orang Keluarga Gubernur Timtim Mengungsi,"""" Republika, September 18, 1999). He announced the government would be building a 200-kilometer road from Kupang to Amfoang Selatan, near the border with East Timor """"because it was packed with refugees."""" In fact, a new road could also facilitate troop movements from West to East Timor. Hendropriyono also announced that the government had prepared resettlement locations in Maluku and Irian Jaya as well as in East Nusa Tenggara province, the province that includes West Timor. Every family would have the right to at least one hectare of land for living and agricultural pursuits, and within two months, all refugees would be sent to these different sites. The preparation of these sites may be a way of trying to move East Timorese against their will to new locations where the militias now patrolling the makeshift camps could be given a more formal role as Wanra in ensuring they do not return to East Timor. There have been some non-Timorese families, now in camps in West Timor, who genuinely want to leave East Timor. In July 1998, for example, after a series of large pro-independence demonstrations, some 15,000 people, mostly Javanese, Balinese, and Buginese (from the island of Sulawesi) fled East Timor. In February 1999, Hendropriyono announced that his ministry was constructing a resettlement site on the island of Wetar, to the north of Timor, in preparation for some 20,000 people, apparently pro-Indonesia settlers, that the government expected to leave. On August 19, in the middle of the process to register voters for the referendum, over one hundred Balinese transmigrant families from East Timor arrived in Atambua, just over the border in West Timor. But after the forced expulsion beginning September 5 of tens of thousands of East Timorese by pro-Indonesia militias, the involvement of the transmigration ministry has taken on a much more sinister aspect.  Hendropriyono's own involvement adds to the concern. Born in Java in 1945, he started his military career with Kopassus, then called RPKAD, the Indonesian special forces that have been implicated in organizing militias in East Timor, in 1968 and worked his way up through various counterinsurgency and intelligence assignments until 1987, when he was appointed commander of the regional military command in Lampung, Sumatra. It was under his command that army forces stormed a Muslim school in Lampung in 1989 where two army officers had been taken hostage; some one hundred civilians were believed killed in the process, although no investigation ever took place. He served in key positions in the military intelligence agency BAIS from 1991 to 1993, when he was appointed Jakarta commander. His star seemed to fall after failing to prevent anti-Soeharto demonstrations in 1994, but his friendship with one of the Soeharto sons seems to have led to his political resurrection. Relief workers in Kupang told Human Rights Watch that many, perhaps most, of the displaced in West Timor have been forcibly expelled by militias since September 5, 1999, apparently as a way of depopulating the western districts of East Timor. Refugees have told church workers that with so many pro-independence supporters forced out, pro-autonomy forces may be preparing to either demand that the August 30 referendum organized by the United Nations be held again, this time with votes counted by district, or to insist that the western districts of East Timor be incorporated into Indonesia, thereby effectively partitioning the territory. Human Rights Watch has also received credible reports that the Indonesian authorities are confiscating the identity papers from many of those displaced into West Timor. Such actions may be further evidence of a deliberate strategy by the Indonesian authorities to prevent the return of pro-independence supporters to East Timor.  Human Rights Watch has called on international humanitarian agencies, including UNHCR, to supervise the registration of displaced persons in West Timor, and to ensure that no one is forced out of West Timor against his or her will.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

This briefing paper examines some of the issues surrounding such accountability. Those guilty of human rights abuses in East Timor could be brought to justice before a new ad hoc international tribunal, before the courts of Indonesia, or before the courts of other countries. The first step, however, will be solid documentation of the human rights crimes that have been committed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson has called for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry. Human Rights Watch endorses this call. Only such a commission would have the resources and the mandate to carry out the wide-ranging investigation that will be required to bring the guilty parties to justice.  Q. Who could establish a commission of inquiry?   A. A commission of inquiry could be established by the Security Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the U.N. Secretary-General or the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Following the genocides in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Security Council established commissions of inquiry which ultimately led to the creation of ad hoc criminal tribunals. A Security Council mandate, under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, would have the most force as member states could be required to cooperate with its work. The Commission on Human Rights, which may be holding a special session on East Timor, could also establish such a commission. The Secretary-General has the authority to appoint an inquiry commission as well. Finally, the High Commissioner on Human Rights has also offered to take the initiative in launching such an international commission.   Q. Where could those responsible be brought to justice?   A. The strongest option would be the creation by the Security Council of an ad hoc international tribunal created by the Security Council, similar to those for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Indonesia, of course, also has a responsibility to bring perpetrators of grave abuses to justice before its own courts. Given its denials of responsiblity thus far and the extent of involvement in the terror by senior army officers, it is unlikely that Indonesia will make any serious move toward prosecuting these crimes in the near future. Finally, those accused of acts such as torture and crimes against humanity could be brought before the courts of other countries based on the universality of jurisdiction, as in the case of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.   Q. The Secretary-General said that the violence in East Timor """"could amount ... to crimes against humanity."""" What are crimes against humanity?   A. Crimes against humanity are widespread or systematic crimes against a civilian population, in war or peace. These crimes include, among other things: murder, extermination, deportation, forced expulsion, imprisonment, torture, rape, and deliberate denial of access to food.   Q. What about war crimes?   A. What happened in East Timor between August 30, 1999 and the middle of September was not a war- there were not two sides. It appears instead to have been a deliberate campaign to destroy the territory, take revenge on pro-independence supporters, and force hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.   Q. If militias and local troops committed much of the violence, how high up the army chain of command should accountability for these crimes extend?   A. Any evidence suggesting a deliberate policy by army officers to organize, arm, equip, train, or otherwise assist the militias in their actions against pro-independence East Timorese would make those officers complicit in abuse. The abundant evidence of a deliberate army policy not to halt militia violence and of refusal of the Indonesian police to arrest militia members responsible for attacks also indicates complicity. Accountability for crimes against humanity could conceivably go all the way up to the commander of the Indonesian armed forces. It is worth noting that before the Indonesian government agreed to a multinational force, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested that Indonesian officials might also be considered complicit in crimes against humanity if they failed to allow a multinational force in to stop the violence, since national authorities had failed to do so and the multinational force was ready and willing to go.   Q. What is the timetable for getting inquiries and prosecutions underway?   A. The priority of the United Nations now is rightly on getting the multinational force into East Timor as quickly as possible, not only to help restore order but to provide security for humanitarian relief efforts. When the multinational force is in place, it will be easier for local and international human rights monitors to verify reports of atrocities and get some idea of the scale of crimes committed. The United Nations could then move quickly to establish an investigative commission.   Q. What kind of international accountability can there be for crimes committed by militias in West Timor?   A. We believe that if the same militias who may be responsible for crimes against humanity are committing crimes against East Timorese independence supporters in West Timor, their actions in West Timor should be included within the purview of any commission of inquiry set up by the United Nations.   Q. Will this really mean justice for the people of East Timor? Look how long it has taken to get any convictions in Bosnia or Rwanda, and how few people have actually been prosecuted.   A. It is probably true that the current Indonesian government will be reluctant to assist international efforts in the investigation and prosecution of Indonesian army officers and key militia leaders. If they are not in East Timor, the U.N.-mandated multinational force will have no authority to arrest them. But if enough evidence is compiled to clearly identify individual responsibility and name names, these men could still be indicted by an international tribunal. There is a possibility that a future Indonesian government, with more civilian authority, would have an interest in assisting the accountability effort and seeing justice done. In that case, it might be willing to arrest the men and turn them over to the tribunal. In any case, an international indictment carries a major stigma; anyone named as being complicit in crimes against humanity will become an international pariah. Even if militia leaders and their army backers seek safety in West Timor or in other parts of Indonesia, international pressure can still be exerted by governments around the world. It should be a condition of resuming arms sales and military-to-military links by Indonesia's major donors that prosecutions of those responsible for the death and destruction in East Timor are under way.   Q. If a commission of inquiry is established, what time period should it cover?   A. Massive human rights violations have taken place in East Timor since the Indonesian invasion in December 1975. But a commission of inquiry with a mandate to investigate the past twenty-four years might never get of the ground for political and practical reasons. We therefore believe its work should be limited to the period from January 27, 1999, the date that President Habibie announced that he would give East Timorese the option of declaring independence from Indonesia, to September 30, 1999.","Asia, Timor-Leste","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/09/20/extradition-general-augusto-pinochet","The Extradition of General Augusto Pinochet","The Extradition of General Augusto Pinochet","A Human Rights Watch Update","09/20/1999","On September 27, 1999, formal extradition (""""committal"""") proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet will begin. These proceedings are expected to last about a week. Human Rights Watch, which took part in the Pinochet hearings before the House of Lords, has prepared the following background paper to help untangle some complex legal issues. """"The major legal hurdle to Pinochet's prosecution was overcome when the House of Lords ruled that he had no immunity,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"He can drag this out with appeals, but he has no legal defense to the very solid and substantial charges which remain in the case, """" added Brody.    How will the committal hearing be structured?     The hearing at Bow Street magistrates' court should last four or possibly five days. First the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), representing Spain, will present its case. That should take about one and one half days. Then Pinochet's lawyers will present their defenses, which could take an equal amount of time. The CPS will then be able to reply. It is expected that Magistrate Ronald Bartle will then give a decision two weeks later. General Pinochet will not appear during the proceedings, but will be present when the decision is read.    What are the charges against General Pinochet?     The House of Lords, in its second ruling of March 24, 1999, ruled that the only allegations for which General Pinochet could be extradited were torture and conspiracy to torture after December 8, 1988, when the U.N. torture convention took effect in the U.K. The original Spanish extradition request also included charges of genocide, hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder. These charges were eliminated either by the House of Lords (hostage-taking and conspiracy to murder) or by the Secretary of State (genocide).    How many cases of torture are now included in the charges?     After the House of Lords ruling, Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon added a total of 60 cases of torture occurring after December 8, 1988. The most salient of these cases -- some 36 -- will be presented by the CPS.     In addition, the indictment alleges over 1,000 cases of """"disappearances."""" International law considers """"disappearances"""" to be continuing crimes as long as the fate of the """"disappeared"""" remains hidden - and thus they continue past 1988 even if the victims were abducted earlier. Several international declarations and court decisions consider """"disappearances"""" to be a form of torture as regards the loved ones of the """"disappeared"""" person and potentially as regards the """"disappeared"""" person himself.    What about the charge of conspiracy to commit torture?     Given the Lords' elimination of the vast majority of individual acts of torture, the conspiracy charge assumes a central role in the prosecution. As Lord Hope emphasized in the Lords' decision, the """"case which is being made against Senator Pinochet...is that each act of torture has to be seen in the context of a continuing conspiracy to commit torture. As a whole, the picture which is presented is of a conspiracy to commit widespread and systematic torture and murder in order to obtain control of the government and, having done so, to maintain control of government by those means for as long as might be necessary."""" Much of this """"continuing conspiracy"""" -- the creation of the secret police, state approval and tolerance of torture, the establishment of Operation Condor targeting Pinochet's opponents abroad -- took place before December 1988. Spain will not be able to prosecute Pinochet for the substantive crimes (i.e. the acts of torture) from the earlier period, but it can introduce proof of those crimes as part of the process of demonstrating the conspiracy.    What must the Crown Prosecution Service show in the extradition proceedings?     According to the European Convention on Extradition, to which both the U.K. and Spain are parties, the CPS must present """"a statement of the offences for which extradition is requested"""" including the """"time and place of their commission, their legal descriptions and a reference to the relevant legal provisions."""" In addition, the CPS must present authenticated copies of the relevant Spanish warrants and decrees and their translations as well as information establishing General Pinochet's identity.    Is the Crown required to establish a prima facie case against General Pinochet?     No. The CPS needs only to establish that the formalities of extradition have been complied with. In most extradition proceedings in the U.K., the requesting state must present evidence which """"would be sufficient to warrant his trial if the extradition crime had taken place"""" in the U.K -- the so-called prima facie case. European countries have a special arrangement, however. Under the European Convention on Extradition there is no evidentiary burden - only the formalities must be presented.    What will General Pinochet's defense be?     The opportunities for General Pinochet at this stage are very narrow, given the rules of the European Convention on Extradition. His lawyers may argue that the allegations do not amount to extraditable offenses under Spanish law or under English law. They may argue that because the post-1988 cases do not involve Spanish victims, Spain has no jurisdiction. They might assert that the CPS cannot now add new acts of torture to the charges. They may challenge the inclusion of the """"disappearance"""" cases.    If the magistrate rules that General Pinochet be committed for extradition, can he appeal?     Pinochet can bring a habeas corpus proceeding before the Divisional Court. Under Britain's Extradition Act, Pinochet can seek to be discharged on any of the following grounds: the trivial nature of the offence, the passage of time since the offense was committed, bad faith in the accusation, or, having regard to all the circumstances, that it would be """"unjust or oppressive"""" to send him to Spain.    If the Divisional Court rules against him, can General Pinochet appeal to the House of Lords?     If leave is granted, Pinochet may take his habeas corpus application up to the House of Lords. Some lawyers assert that he may do this as of right, without seeking leave to appeal.    What happens when Pinochet's appeals are exhausted?     The matter returns to the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, who makes a final decision on his extradition. He may refuse extradition on any of the grounds reviewed by the Divisional Court during the habeas corpus proceedings (see above), or under his general discretionary powers. The Home Secretary, in issuing his second Authority to Proceed on April 15, stated that in his final decision he would """"consider the extradition request afresh...tak[ing] into account any findings in the committal proceedings and any habeas corpus proceedings as well as any representations which Senator Pinochet may wish to make against return."""" In particular, the Secretary indicated that the question of whether Pinochet's """"age and health would render it unjust or oppressive"""" to extradite him was a """"question, among others, [which could] be re-examined in the light of any developments, at the stage when he comes to exercise his final discretion at the end of the extradition process.""""    Can Pinochet challenge the Home Secretary's final ruling?     Yes. If Pinochet is given leave, he can seek a judicial review of the Secretary's decision before the Divisional Court on the ground that the Secretary exercised his discretion unreasonably. Given the Secretary's wide discretion, however, the likelihood of success is extremely narrow. The decision of the Division Court can be appealed to the House of Lords only if leave is granted.    Would Spain's prosecution of Pinochet be limited to those crimes for which he is extradited?     Yes. Under the long-standing extradition rule of """"specialty,"""" as well as under the European Convention on Extradition, Spain could not try Pinochet for crimes other than those for which he was extradited, and could not re-extradite him to a third country, without the consent of the United Kingdom.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

City authorities have justified the round-ups as a security measure in response to the recent bombings in Russia, which have claimed about 200 lives so far. Government officials in Moscow have asserted that Chechens bear responsibility for the recent explosions. """"Let's not confuse the legitimate need for extra security with collective punishment,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The Moscow city government has a reflexive reaction in security emergencies—round up all the people with dark skin. These people inevitably become the victims of police brutality and extortion.""""  Moscow strictly enforces an onerous registration policy for all visitors. Even in peaceful times, police enforce the regulations by routinely detaining individuals to check registration documents; overwhelmingly, they detain people with the darker skin typical of natives of the Caucasus region, known in Russian as """"blacks."""" During the 1993 fighting between the parliament and the Kremlin, security forces forced 9,000 non-Muscovites out of the city, and claimed that an additional 10,000 left voluntarily. """"Our research has shown that the registration system serves as very convenient pretext for extortion,"""" said Ms. Cartner. """"It is not unusual for people with or without residence permits to be stopped three or four times in one day, and to be hit up for bribes each time."""" She noted that some non-ethnic Russians choose to isolate themselves indoors, to avoid the police altogether. The police typically conduct identity checks in public places, such as markets and public transportation, but they also visit the private homes of refugees, or of people from Central Asia or the Caucasus, and may return to the same homes repeatedly. The police frequently use violence during such checks. One victim of a recent identity check, an ethnic Chechen with a permanent residence permit for Moscow, told Human Rights Watch about his experience. On Friday, September 10, the day after a powerful blast killed an dozens of people in Moscow, masked police came to his home at approximately 3:30 pm. """"I opened the door and they pushed my children away, and struck my wife,"""" the man told a Human Rights Watch researcher. """"As soon as they came in, they put a pistol to my forehead, and hit me in the back of my neck."""" While searching his home for approximately twenty minutes, the police beat and kicked the man as he lay on the floor. The Human Rights Watch researcher saw the bruises and scratches on the man's body. Police did not have a warrant for the search, which found no evidence. It was the third time since the 1993-96 Chechen war that police had come to the man's home. The police then brought him to an organized crime police unit. In a corridor at the police station, the man claimed, police were beating five other Chechens and asking them, """"Do you know Khattab?"""" One of the leaders of an armed insurgency in Dagestan, in southern Russia, calls himself Khattab. Some Russian officials have suggested he is behind the Moscow bombings. Also on Friday, September 10, a Human Rights Watch researcher witnessed a police search of the Daimokhk Chechen-Ingush cultural center, a meeting place for people from the Caucasus in Moscow. The police had no warrant for the search, but claimed it was merely an """"inspection."""" The """"inspection"""" was conducted by two masked policemen and three in plainclothes.

U.S. troops entering Haiti on September 19, 1994 seized approximately 160,000 documents, and Washington has said that it will only return the materials once U.S. citizens' names have been deleted. The government of Haiti has insisted that the documents must not be edited. The group also called on the U.S. government to deport paramilitary leader Emmanuel """"Toto"""" Constant to Haiti, where he is wanted for human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial executions. """"Five years after U.S. troops seized these materials, Washington continues to keep this potentially rich source of evidence abuses away from Haitian prosecutors,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"It certainly looks like the administration is trying to conceal wrongdoing in Haiti on the part of the U.S. government."""" U.S. forces seized approximately 160,000 pages of documents and other materials from paramilitary FRAPH (Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, Front pour l'Avancement et le Progrès d'Haïti) and Haitian military offices in the fall of 1994, reportedly including """"trophy"""" photographs of torture victims, audio and videotapes of torture sessions, membership applications for FRAPH, passports, identification cards, and business records. The material was taken to the United States without the knowledge or consent of Haitian authorities. FRAPH reportedly was founded with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assistance and """"Toto"""" Constant, its director, has repeatedly stated that he received regular CIA payments. FRAPH members were responsible for human rights atrocities under the military government that ruled Haiti from 1991 to 1994, including extrajudicial executions, torture, and rape. The U.S. government has maintained that U.S. citizens' names and identifying information must be deleted from the materials before they are returned to Haitian custody. This apparently serves the illegitimate purpose of covering up possible U.S. complicity in political murder and other abuses, particularly the apparent involvement of U.S. intelligence agents with the military regime and FRAPH. Human Rights Watch said that the U.S. government's refusal to cooperate with Haiti's efforts to build the rule of law has damaged U.S. credibility. """"While the U.S. government formally endorses programs designed to improve Haiti's justice system, it is simultaneously obstructing efforts to establish justice for Haitian human rights victims,"""" said Roth. """"Washington is working against itself."""" The U.S. government also impeded the prosecution of human rights crimes in Haiti by reaching a secret 1996 settlement with Constant, allowing him to remain in the United States. Constant was detained in the U.S. and ordered deported by a U.S. immigration judge who found that """"allowing [Constant] to remain in the United States fosters the impression that the United States endorses FRAPH and its actions."""" Nevertheless, on June 14, 1996, the Clinton administration decided to release him into the United States rather than return him to Haiti, provided him with a work permit, and required that he abide by a gag order. Constant also retained the option to choose deportation to a country other than Haiti or the Dominican Republic, subject to U.S. approval. He now lives in Queens, New York.

Founded in 1978, Human Rights Watch has grown to be the largest U.S.-based human rights organization.

""""The public support we have gotten so far is simply overwhelming,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Roth noted that such an ambitious endowment campaign was unusual for an advocacy group. """"We're not going to build a building with this money, and we're not going to endow a chair,"""" said Roth. """"What makes this campaign different is that people are committing themselves to the power of an idea."""" Roth said the endowment would support efforts that Human Rights Watch's annual $15 million budget cannot cover adequately. Those efforts include guaranteeing Human Rights Watch's capacity to respond quickly to human rights emergencies anywhere on the globe -- such as this year's crises in Kosovo, Sierra Leone and East Timor -- as well as providing funds for areas of the world that attract less financing because they are outside the limelight. To date, the campaign has received a number of extraordinary gifts. The Sandler Family Supporting Foundation of Oakland, California has pledged $10 million, and the Sandlers have challenged Human Rights Watch supporters to match their gift. Irene Diamond has pledged $5 million in addition to her earlier significant pledge. Fiona and Stanley Druckenmiller, The Ford Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T.

But it warned that the lack of clarity over the exact role of the Indonesian armed forces needed urgently to be resolved either in the resolution or in subsequent protocols in order to forestall further atrocities. The draft resolution authorizes the establishment of a multinational force under a unified command that would take """"all necessary measures"""" to: restore peace and security protect and support the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) facilitate humanitarian assistance operationsThose measures could and should include disarmament of militias and arrests of those responsible for human rights abuses. The draft underscores the continuing responsibility of Indonesia to maintain peace and security in East Timor """"in the interim phase between the conclusion of the popular consultation""""—the referendum held on August 30, 1999—and """"the start of the implementation of its result."""" According to the May 5, 1999 agreement between Portugal and Indonesia, that process of beginning East Timor's transition to independence would begin as soon as Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly signs off on the referendum results, possibly in November. This means that absent a separate protocol on a phased withdrawal of Indonesian troops prior to action by the People's Consultative Assembly, the Indonesian army could continue to have a major role in East Timor for at least two months and perhaps longer. (There is now some question in Jakarta as to whether the assembly will in fact endorse the results, and if that were the case, the Indonesian army could be in East Timor indefinitely.) A protocol setting out a clear timetable for Indonesian army withdrawal is thus critical.

Moreover, my relatives received a letter from him on September 6, saying he was alive and well, that everything was fine, and that he was hoping to be out by December.""""  """"The circumstances surrounding Garaev's death are extremely suspicious,"""" stated Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The Turkmen government has a poor track record with the truth, and from the beginning fabricated outrageous charges against Garaev. So we have no reason to believe its version of Garaev's death."""" Garaev was linked with former Turkmen vice-president Avdy Kuliev, an archrival to President Saparmurad Niyazov, who currently lives in exile. In 1994, Turkmen security forces arrested Garaev, a Russian citizen, in Uzbekistan. He was brought to Turkmenistan without the formality of an extradition procedure. In 1995, a Turkmen court sentenced him, together with Mukhammetkuli Aimuradov, to twelve and fifteen years, respectively, in a maximum-security labor colony on trumped-up charges of """"planning the violent overthrow of the constitutional order of Turkmenistan...and the armed seizure of power."""" During the investigation Turkmen authorities reportedly severely mistreated Garaev and Aimuradov and prevented them from contacting their lawyers, or from examining evidence or question witnesses against them. In November 1998, the Turkmen government launched new charges against Garaev and Aimuradov, including conspiracy to assassinate the president. The new charges allegedly stemmed from an incident in prison officials falsely told Garaev that his young son had died, causing Garaev to attack the prison guards in a rage. After an international outcry underscored the absurdity of the assassination charges, a court sentenced Garaev to ten additional years on charges of attempted escape. """"Garaev was political prisoner — he should never have been in prison in the first place,"""" Ms. Cartner continued.

Most of these people are displaced within East Timor. Thousands are in police stations and district and subdistrict military commands, believing the only safety lies with those responsible for the violence. Others are in church compounds or have fled to the hills, anywhere where they can escape.  Tens of thousands more have fled or been forcibly displaced to West Timor. Some 90,000 East Timorese were believed to have crossed into West Timor by September 11, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported on September 8 that people were crossing over the border from East Timor at a rate of 3,000 an hour.  Many were arriving on their own by car or van, having had to pass through several checkpoints on the road into Atambua, West Timor, just across the border. In some cases, people who had sought refuge in police or military commands in East Timor were later taken by militias to West Timor, to the towns of Atambua, Kefa, Soe, or Kupang. In some instances, this was voluntary, in others clearly not. Evidence is mounting that the exodus to West Timor was a planned army operation. In Baucau, just before the evacuation of the local office of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) on September 7, the district military commander looked at the UNAMET local staff standing on the tarmac of the Baucau airfield and according to an eyewitness, said, """"These are IDPs, right? I have orders that all IDPs have to go to Atambua and Kupang."""" It was only after he was assured that they were not internally displaced persons that they were permitted to board the plane to Dili. In a September 12, 1999 dispatch, Humphrey Hawksley, a BBC journalist, reported that local government officials in West Timor told him they were intructed to prepare camps for East Timorese four days before the August 30 referendum and that specific areas in East Timor were being marked for evacuation. One NGO reported that the militias were deliberately spreading false information of imminent attacks by the pro-independence guerrilla army, Falintil, as a way of persuading people to leave in the days after the results of the referendum were announced. In Dili, militia members reportedly went house to house, seeking individual families, and ordering them to leave. The families were taken first to the Dili provincial police command and then transported to West Timor by military ship, airplane, or truck. All such departures are accompanied by militia, police, or army, and sometimes all three, and new groups of militia or police are on hand to monitor the arrivals in West Timor. In most cases, soldiers or police ask those fleeing to register their names. While the name lists may be necessary, as police claimed, to obtain social services from provincial government offices in West Timor, there is concern that they may also be used to keep track of pro-independence people.  NGO workers quoting the Social Services Department of East Nusa Tenggara province, which includes West Timor, say there are large concentrations of refugees in the Belu district military command (Kodim 1605) and police station, and in the offices of the Belu branch of the Indonesian Democratic Struggle Party (PDI-Perjuangan). In the area around Kupang, there are large concentrations of refugees in Noelbaki village, at the Social Services Department office, in the Kupang Sports Building, at the Bougenvil restaurant, and at a hostel called Ivory Coconut. Many other refugees are finding shelter in small groups in the districts of Alor, North Central Timor and South Central Timor. Non-East Timorese are also fleeing, also with militia escorts. Many of them are leaving by ship from Dili harbor, bound for East Java or South Sulawesi, but many are also ending up in West Timor, joining some pro-autonomy refugees who left as long as six months ago. Some East Timorese have also managed to escape to Australia by plane and boat. Protection for the displaced Displaced persons in both East and West Timor have little or no protection. All places of refuge in East Timor, except for military and police commands, are considered fair game for the militias because they are seen as concentrations of independence supporters. Thus, schools, church compounds, and large buildings housing the displaced have been attacked and burned across East Timor. East Timorese who worked for the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) or for international agencies are especially at risk, particularly after the closing of all field offices of UNAMET and the besieging of the main UN compound in Dili. (As of September 11, some 1,000 displaced persons remained in the compound with about 80 international UNAMET staff.) The protection of the displaced can not be guaranteed by the police and military who have either allowed or directly participated in the attacks and have refused to use force against the militias. In West Timor, there are credible reports that militia members have a presence in some of the camps. Those fleeing from, or forcibly expelled by, the militia have no protection from intimidation or violence. Staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have come under attack, ostensibly by some of the displaced, angry at all foreigners because they associate foreigners with the UN whom they blame for their plight. Other foreign relief workers have also been threatened. In fact, we believe that this anger may be being fomented by the militia as well. Humanitarian access and assistance All humanitarian workers in East Timor have now been evacuated. One humanitarian agency, forced to evacuate on September 7, reported that hospitals and clinics were being systematically destroyed. A UNAMET convoy was attacked by militias as it tried to move food from one of its warehouses on September 8, while Indonesian military stood by and did nothing. Without access to food, shelter, or medical care, and as the number of displaced steadily grows, the likelihood of a major humanitarian catastrophe is high. In light of the above we urge the Indonesian government and the international community to take the following steps: 1. Immediate humanitarian access The Indonesian government and local authorities must allow international humanitarian agencies and NGOs immediate, full, free and safe access to all displaced persons, wherever they are. The physical security of all humanitarian workers must be ensured and they must be allowed to do their work without obstruction, interference, threats or harassment. Humanitarian convoys must be given full and unimpeded access to bring humanitarian assistance to all displaced persons wherever they are. 2. Give protection the highest priority As well as delivery of humanitarian assistance, international agencies, especially those with a protection mandate, must be given full, free and safe access to provide protection to displaced populations in both East and West Timor. Displaced populations must be protected against physical assaults and attacks; arbitrary arrest, detention or disappearances; and further forced displacement.  3. Facilitate return The right of all displaced persons to return to their homes must be upheld. As soon as their safety and security can be guaranteed, displaced persons should be helped to return. Many of the displaced were forcibly expelled from their homes, others were forced to flee due to violence and intimidation. The forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people seems to be part of a deliberate strategy to alter the political balance in East Timor and reduce the numbers of independence supporters, particularly in East Timor's western districts. It is a clear violation of internationally accepted legal principles. Those who were forcibly displaced must be allowed to return to their homes as soon as it is safe to do so. At the same time, no one should be forced to return if his or her safety can not be guaranteed. The return of displaced persons should be facilitated and monitored by international agencies with a clear protection mandate. International monitoring should also continue after displaced persons have returned to their homes, to ensure their safety and security. 4. Security for humanitarian workers The safety and security of all humanitarian workers must be guaranteed. The multinational peacekeeping force dispatched to East Timor must have mandated responsibility for securing the safety of all humanitarian workers and ensuring that they enjoy full, free and safe access to all displaced persons. 5. Asylum in neighboring or other countries Finally, those who flee East Timor to other countries must be given full international refugee protection. Those fleeing the current violence in East Timor have a valid fear of persecution and should be considered as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention. No one with a fear of persecution should be returned to East Timor against their will, and the fundamental principle of non-refoulement must be upheld in all countries of asylum.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Internally Displaced People"

Failed to Avert Angola Disaster","Civilians Suffering Massive Rights Abuse, Starvation","09/13/1999","The United Nations made fatal errors in its mission to Angola, where civilians now face starvation and massive human rights abuse as a result of the resurgent war, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 205-page report, """"Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process,"""" is the result of a five-year study of the Angolan peace process since the Lusaka Accords in November 1994. Its publication coincides with a growing humanitarian crisis and a new United Nations mission starting up in Angola. """"The U.N.'s involvement in Angola has basically been a disaster,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the executive director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"During the Lusaka peace process the U.N. spent $1.5 billion, most of it down the drain."""" The problem, said Takirambudde, was that the U.N. turned a blind eye toward breaches of the peace accords, which eroded confidence in the peace process and created a vicious cycle of steadily worsening rights abuses. """"This policy of ‘See No Evil, Speak No Evil' completely backfired in Angola,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Unless the U.N. learns from this fatal mistake, its new mission in Angola will also be at risk—and so will similar missions in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone."""" In September, the Security Council is likely to authorize a new thirty-person U.N. mission. Human Rights Watch warned that the mission's Human Rights Division should be given a clear-cut mandate which includes investigative work and the dissemination of its findings. Human Rights Watch called on the Angolan government and UNITA rebels to permit neutral humanitarian corridors for relief aid to reach civilians in the interior. The group also called for strengthening international sanctions against UNITA, and said the Angolan government should crackdown on diamond and fuel smuggling by UNITA officials. UNITA's export of diamonds in the last five years has netted the rebels some U.S.$1.72 billion, much of which was spent on weaponry..The conflict in Angola has displaced nearly one million people, ten percent of the country's population. UNITA rebels returned to war in 1998, laying siege to a number of cities and towns, most notable Malanje and Kuito. The shelling of Malanje started in January 1999 and has continued ever since—resulting in at least 600 civilians killed. UNITA's siege of Malanje has caused a growing threat of starvation among the civilian population, and humanitarian relief flights to the city have been suspended from time to time. Mine warfare has intensified since hostilities resumed, with fresh laying of antipersonnel landmines by the government around besieged cities in mine belts and along roads to obstruct UNITA access. The Angolan government signed the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and has clearly failed to live up to its basic provisions. The report documents how human rights abuses and violations of the laws of war were fueled by new flows of weapons into the country—despite the U.N. arms embargo on UNITA, which has been in place since 1993. UNITA purchased large amounts of weaponry from foreign sources. Human Rights Watch believes that some of these weapons originated from private sources in Albania and Bulgaria. UNITA was effective in""""sanctions-busting"""" through neighboring countries, especially South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also Togo and Burkina Faso. In October 1997, the U.N. imposed an additional package of restrictions on UNITA, blocking foreign travel by their officials and closing their offices abroad. Surprisingly, only in July 1998 did the U.N. target the direct and indirect export of diamonds from UNITA areas and freeze UNITA bank accounts, although these were the prime sources of revenue for UNITA's purchases of fuel and weapons. While UNITA bought arms with diamonds, the Angolan government paid for its arms purchases through bank loans, oil profit remittances, and mining and other concessions. Some of the U.S.$870 million of funds generated from signature bonus payments on three oil exploration concession blocks were used to pay for weapons purchases. The multinational oil companies BP-Amoco, Exxon, and Elf play a dominant role in these blocks. The Human Rights Watch report concludes that the U.N. should have deployed its peacekeepers promptly and empowered them to undertake pro-active monitoring and reporting of cease-fire and embargo violations, and gross human rights abuses. The U.N. should also have placed an initial arms embargo on both sides, and an embargo on UNITA's use of diamonds once it became evident that the rebels were using this resource to rearm. The report also states that Angola's leaders must be held accountable for actions that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.","Africa, Angola","United Nations"

Habibie's announcement is a critically important step,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, """"but we need to remember that none of the details have been worked out, and we don't know what terms and conditions the Indonesian government will set."""" Major problems could arise if Indonesia insists on command of an international force or, in deference to growing nationalist sentiment in Jakarta, refuses Australian participation. Any rapid deployment would depend on Australia's providing a substantial proportion of the troops.  Human Rights Watch said that in the negotiations with Indonesia on the peacekeeping force, the United Nations should insist on the following:  while cooperation with Indonesian forces is clearly necessary, command of the multinational force must not rest with the Indonesian army, and there should be a phased withdrawal of Indonesian troops. the multinational force should have a mandate to disarm and arrest militia members as well as Indonesian soldiers responsible for acts of violence. there should be a humanitarian aspect to the force as well, so that international agencies, especially those with a protection mandate, can have full, free and safe access to East Timor, and the displaced themselves can be protected against physical assaults and attacks, arbitrary arrest and detention, disappearances, and further forced displacement. Human Rights Watch said that international sanctions should continue in place until the peacekeepers are on the ground, UNAMET is fully operational again, the displaced are able to return in safety, and the militia members primarily responsible for the violence are under arrest.  Jones said the highest priority, however, should be given to getting the peacekeepers to East Timor as quickly as possible to protect those who are still in danger.  """"Tens of thousands of East Timorese have taken refuge at district and subdistrict military commands and police stations throughout East Timor, where they remain at the mercy of the militias that forced them to flee,"""" she said. In addition, militias have a strong presence in the camps and other facilities set up in West Timor to house many of the 90,000 East Timorese who have fled there. Many of these people, but particularly those closely associated with pro-independence organizations, international agencies, or the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) could be the targets of militia attacks.  The militias could also make a last-ditch attempt to force more East Timorese into West Timor to try to ensure that the demographic balance is permanently altered before an international force comes in.  """"The Indonesian government must understand that it will be held accountable not only for the terror of the past but for any further violence perpetrated by its proxies in East Timor,"""" said Jones.  Human Rights Watch called for a full investigation of what the U.N. Secretary-General has said may amount to """"crimes against humanity."""" It also reiterated its call for an end to martial law. """"We continue to believe that there is no reason the existing 15,000 troops could not control the militias if there was the political will to do so,"""" said Jones.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice, United Nations"

""""The government of Kazakhstan is demonstrating its preferred method for dealing with organized political opposition: simply arrest the leader,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The Russian government should not have accommodated Kazakhstan's repressive actions."""" Cartner noted that the Kazakhstan authorities have used crude tactics against Mr. Kazhegeldin before. """"With one month to go before parliamentary elections, these latest maneuvers are not surprising,"""" she added. According to unconfirmed news reports, Kazakhstan's Prosecutor General ordered Mr. Kazhegeldin's arrest on September 8, possibly on charges of tax evasion. On September 9, the Central Election Commission disqualified Mr. Kazhegeldin from running for a seat in the lower house of parliament on the basis of an October 1998 conviction for contempt of court. On September 10, police in Moscow detained Mr. Kazhegeldin, who has lived abroad since 1997, at Sheremetevo II airport as he arrived on a flight from Europe to meet with members of his political party, the Republican People's Party of Kazakhstan (RPPK). Mr. Kazhegeldin, 47, served as Prime Minister under President Nazarbaev from 1994 to 1997. Late in 1998, he formed the RPPK, and attempted to challenge Nazarbaev for the office of president in the January 10 elections this year. During the campaign period, Mr. Kazhegeldin and his associates were beaten, harassed and followed; shots were fired at Mr. Kazhegeldin outside the former capital, Almaty. Kazakh authorities finally denied him access to the ballot on the basis of his administrative conviction for participation in an unregistered public association, the Movement for Honest Elections.  Mr. Kazhegeldin continued to build up the RPPK in anticipation of elections to the lower house of parliament on October 10. In May 1999, however, Mr. Kazhegeldin's attorneys were informed that he Almaty tax police had initiated criminal charges against Mr. Kazhegeldin, allegedly seven months earlier, in October 1998. The RPPK has announced that it will boycott the election if its chairman is denied a spot on the ballot. Human Rights Watch considers that in light of the clear political motivation for the charges against Mr. Kazhegeldin, Russia should abide by its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, and provide access to a fair asylum hearing. Further, Russia should honor Article 63 of the Russian Constitution, which forbids extradition of persons with a well-grounded fear of political persecution, and Article 57(b) of the Minsk convention, which prohibits honoring extradition requests from states where """"criminal prosecution cannot be carried out in accordance with legislation of the requested party.""""

The same army-backed militias are now in West Timor patrolling the refugee camps, bus terminals, and even the main airport, and some of them have already attacked pro-independence refugees. Human Rights Watch called on the Indonesian government to allow unrestricted access to the camps and to other places where East Timorese were being held, including the district military command and police headquarters in Belu, West Timor, and to ensure the safety of both the displaced and international relief workers. """"Any camp under the control of the Indonesian armed forces cannot offer reliable protection right now to people fleeing East Timor,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"International agencies have to be allowed in immediately, to protect the displaced."""" More than 70,000 East Timorese are believed to have fled or been expelled to West Timor, the western half of the island that is part of a separate Indonesian province. Two international humanitarian agencies have had some access to the refugees in and around the border town of Atambua, but their expatriate and local staff may be vulnerable to militia-led attacks. """"It's clear that the same militias who are responsible for the devastation over the last week in East Timor have pushed the crisis into West Timor,"""" said Jones. """"They appear to have forcibly expelled thousands of terrified people by truck or boat, then handed them over to local security forces who control the camps. These people are not safe from the militias, and they are not safe from attacks by pro-Indonesia elements in the camps."""" Jones noted that thousands of pro-Indonesia refugees, many of them East Timorese associated with the Indonesian adminstration, fled into West Timor after the huge turnout for the referendum on August 30 indicated a pro-independence result. People from among this group may have been responsible for an attack on the United High Comissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) staff on Sept. 7, but it is impossible to know whether or not that attack was spontaneous or planned. The Indonesian government is saying it cannot guarantee the security of international relief workers because the displaced persons hold foreigners and the United Nations responsible for their plight. """"This excuse for restricting access echoes the Indonesian government's spin on the Aug. 30 vote,"""" said Jones, """"and is almost certainly an indication that the displaced are now being used as part of a larger ploy to discredit the referendum.""""

""""This reported threat to journalists calls into question the commitment of the Burundian military authorities to observance of the laws of war, and their willingness to allow investigations of massacres,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"All parties to the conflict in Burundi must respect the protected status of non-combatants, including civilians, journalists, human rights investigators, and humanitarian workers."""" According to media reports, Burundian Defense Minister Colonel Alfred Nkurunziza attacked journalists in a September 9 speech to army commanders broadcast on national radio. The Defense Minister reportedly singled out Radio France International for its report that the main road in Burundi had been closed by combat. The minister is said to have stated that the report proved journalists were openly supporting the rebels. """"When you see journalists here, consider them as enemies, as rebels,"""" the minister was quoted as saying. The minister then reportedly threatened that journalists would be considered legitimate targets if they entered areas of conflict such as the province of Bujumbura Rural. Under international humanitarian law, journalists are considered civilians who enjoy the fundamental guarantees of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Combatants are prohibited under common article 3 from carrying out attacks targeting civilians, including journalists, who do not take an active part in the hostilities.  Combatants on all sides, however, have continued to disregard this most basic principle of the law of war, charged Human Rights Watch. Humanitarian workers and journalists have been targeted in the conflict which has so far cost more than 100,000 civilian lives since October 1993. In April 1995, a South African television producer was killed in an ambush outside the capital Bujumbura. In June 1996, three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed when their clearly identified vehicle was ambushed while delivering aid. Independent investigations have not yet established responsibility for these crimes. Human Rights Watch deplored the increase in attacks against civilians in recent weeks in Burundi. Hundreds were reportedly massacred by the Burundian army in early August after rebel forces attacked a market place outside the capital Bujumbura. Hutu rebels attacked Tutsi neighborhoods on the night of August 28, killing more than thirty people, including many children. In response, Tutsi militias have reportedly begun reorganizing in the capital. The Tutsi militias were responsible for many serious abuses against Hutu inhabitants of the capital in the past.","Africa, Burundi",""

In the report's opening chapter, the commission—chaired by former Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten—declines to """"make judgments about who was culpable for each of the tragedies and mistakes of the past"""" and encourages people to forget the past and focus on a """"fresh start."""" Of the 175 detailed recommendations, none provides a process for the removal of currently serving officers with records of abusive conduct.  This omission clearly flies in the face of voluminous evidence presented to the British government, the RUC, and the Patten Commission itself of abusive conduct by the police throughout the course of """"the Troubles."""" Such abuse has been meticulously documented by Human Rights Watch, numerous other respected international human rights organizations, and United Nations and European officials. """"Past abuses cannot be swept under the rug,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Our experience in other conflict areas tells us that impunity for human rights violations will seriously undermine confidence in whatever ‘new' force is created."""" Cartner said she was happy that the report's first seven recommendations addressed human rights questions: human rights training for police officers, a new oath including human rights pledges, and codes of ethics based on international human rights standards.  While Human Rights Watch welcomed the recommendation to close the """"holding centers""""—specially designated detention facilities for political suspects—it questioned how those detectives who operated in the centers would be dealt with. """"Will new recruits drawn from formerly disenfranchised communities be expected to serve side-by-side with these detectives, many of whom are easily identifiable and have been responsible for the physical and psychological abuse of detainees?"""" asked Cartner. """"And how can the Policing Commission encourage members of communities currently under-represented in the RUC to join a force that has systematically harassed, intimidated, and abused them over the years?"""" Cartner noted that 93 percent of RUC officers are Protestant. """"If the people reponsible for abuse are not held accountable, the RUC will have serious trouble attracting Catholics, women, and other ethnic minorities in the future,"""" Cartner said. The group also expressed concern over the recommendations regarding the RUC Special Branch, responsible for dealing with political violence. Credible allegations of Special Branch collusion with loyalist paramilitaries have plagued the RUC, and recent revelations about possible Special Branch complicity in the murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane in 1989 have fueled urgent calls for the British government to establish an independent inquiry into the killing. The Patten report recommends that the Special Branch and Crime Branch units of the RUC be merged under the command of a single Assistant Chief Constable. There is no recommendation that the Special Branch be evaluated to determine past abusive practices or for the unit itself to be replaced with a more accountable special unit. """"It looks like the Special Branch will remain intact with absolutely no appraisal of its dodgy human rights record,"""" said Cartner. """"This is unacceptable given the controversial nature of the policing undertaken by Special Branch in the past."""" In written submissions to the Patten Commission, Human Rights Watch urged it to recommend an independent vetting process to weed out currently serving police officers with abusive records. The group also expressed concern over the Patten commission's failure adequately to address emergency legislation and to recommend an outright ban on plastic bullets.

The report, """"Spare the Child: Corporal Punishment in Kenyan Schools,"""" documents how teachers routinely slap, pinch, kick, cane with bamboo or wooden sticks, or sometimes flog their students with rubber whips. Boys are usually hit on the backside, while girls are hit on the palm of the hand, although children also reported being beaten all over their bodies, including their heads.   Children are punished for a wide range of behavior including extraordinarily minor """"offenses,"""" such as fidgeting in class, being tardy, wearing a torn or dirty uniform, or not being able to answer a question. Children are also often punished for poor academic performance, when they fail to score the teacher's target mark on an exam. Sometimes an entire class might be caned for failing to reach target marks on national exams.   Kenya's regulations on school discipline currently authorize the use of corporal punishment in schools. They strictly limit and regulate its use, but those limits are routinely ignored, and the infliction of corporal punishment is unchecked, widespread, arbitrary, and often brutal.   """"Kenyan teachers basically have free license to beat their students,"""" said Yodon Thonden, counsel to the Children's Rights division of Human Rights Watch, and researcher of the report. """"The laws should be changed-and so should many years of cruel habit.""""   Children often suffer bruises and cuts, while more severe injuries-such as broken bones, knocked-out teeth, internal bleeding-are not uncommon. Many suffer psychological scars. In the most extreme cases, beatings have left children permanently disfigured, disabled and even dead.   The Ministry of Education has done little to enforce the nominal limits on corporal punishment. Teachers are rarely questioned or disciplined for using excessive force against their students, even when serious injuries result. In the rare cases when criminal prosecutions did result because the children were seriously injured or killed, teachers tended to be acquitted or let off with only minor fines.   Little or no redress exists for children and parents who oppose such punishment. Those interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they feared that complaining might lead to further harassment by teachers and more severe punishments in the future.   Headmasters reported that those who complain are given a choice-accept the punishment or quit the school. Transferring to another school after """"disciplinary"""" trouble can be close to impossible. The result is that some children are effectively forced to give up their education altogether.   """"Not only is this corporal punishment a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of children, it also affects children's basic right to education,"""" said Thonden. """"There are clear links between teachers beating children and children dropping out of school.""""   Such routine and severe corporal punishment violates both Kenyan law and international human rights standards. According to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, school corporal punishment is incompatible with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the world's most widely-ratified human rights treaty. Many nations throughout the world have recognized that school corporal punishment violates the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and constitutes a cruel, inhuman, and degrading practice.   Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan government and its Ministry of Education to ban corporal punishment in schools, and to aggressively seek to train teachers in alternative means of maintaining discipline and motivating children.","Africa, Kenya","Children's Rights, Education"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/09/08/chinese-targeting-eastern-tibetans","Chinese Targeting Eastern Tibetans","Chinese Targeting Eastern Tibetans","","09/08/1999","(New York) --In a report released today, Human Rights Watch describes how China's intolerance of Tibetan political activity extends into areas of Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces. Half of the Tibetans under Chinese rule live in these areas, known as """"eastern Tibet,"""" outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region (see Excerpts from Stories of Tibetans Profiled in the New Human Rights Watch Report).   Tibetan activists in """"eastern Tibet"""" have been sentenced to years in prison for putting up posters calling for China to leave Tibet, writing letters of support to other prisoners, and circulating speeches by the Dalai Lama. They have been tortured during interrogations by police and put under intensive surveillance after their release from prison.   """"Human rights violations in ‘eastern Tibet' were simply off the world's radar screen until two foreigners and their Tibetan translator were detained there,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The lesson of their detention and our new report is that it's absolutely essential for foreign correspondents, U.N. human rights monitors, and international humanitarian agencies to have regular access to the region.""""   The new report, """"Profiles of Tibetan Exiles"""" draws on the experiences of five young Tibetans who fled into India from Sichuan, Gansu, and the Gansu-Qinghai border areas. All came from poor families in areas that the Chinese government had designated autonomous Tibetan prefectures or counties. All had unusual access to education and became involved in political activities through discussions at state schools or academies. All were detained by Chinese security forces for possession or circulation of published materials about the Dalai Lama or Tibetan independence.   The extreme sensitivity of the Chinese government toward any hint of Tibetan political activism was graphically demonstrated in mid-August. Chinese officials detained two Tibet specialists, an American and an Australian, together with their Tibetan translator, in a Tibetan area of Qinghai province where a controversial World Bank project is underway. The project involves the resettlement of thousands of non-Tibetan farmers in a county where many Tibetans are concerned about the impact of in-migration on their culture.   """"The detention of the two Tibet specialists and their translator in Qinghai got international attention because foreigners were involved,"""" said Jones. """"But arrests of local activists in these eastern Tibetan regions deserve the same scrutiny—and the same condemnation."""" She said the August detentions illustrated how worried China was about access by foreigners to regions with a potential for political unrest, in part because information about abusive practices might come to light.   The new Human Rights Watch report is based on interviews with dozens of """"eastern"""" Tibetan refugees in India. The interviews, including the five people profiled in depth in this report, were conducted in late 1998 and 1999. Some of those interviewed were open advocates of Tibetan independence; Chinese authorities consider such advocacy tantamount to subversion.   Human Rights Watch takes no stand on Tibet's political status, but maintains that international human rights law protects the rights of Tibetans to peacefully express pro-independence sentiments in public. The types of activity described in this report, for which the men profiled were detained and eventually forced to flee, included leafleting, putting up posters, flying the Tibetan flag, distributing books and tapes containing the writings and speeches of the Dalai Lama, shouting slogans, and teaching other Tibetans about Tibetan history and culture outside the aegis of government institutions. All those activities are protected under the right to free expression, all are peaceful, and none have taken place in the context of insurrection or threat of insurrection.   The Tibetan areas of Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Yunnan have a different history from the Tibetan Autonomous Region, or T.A.R., as they had mostly been brought under direct control of China's Manchu emperors by the end of the eighteenth century. By contrast, what is now known as the T.A.R. continued to be governed by incarnations of the Dalai Lama until 1950.   EXCERPTS FROM STORIES OF TIBETANS PROFILED IN THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT   """"Don't think you can work against the government,"""" an interrogator told Dolkar Kyap, a twenty-eight-year-old Tibetan who was picked up for questioning in March 1995 in his native Gansu province.   Dolkar Kyap spent six days with his hands chained to a pipe in the ceiling overnight or for part of the day. Eventually he confessed to the accusations his interrogators were making, most of which were true—that he had put up posters of the Dalai Lama, distributed pro-independence leaflets in monasteries, and used the mimeograph machine at a government school to reproduce other political material. He was moved to three different detention facilities over a three-month period before he was formally arrested. Only then did his family have any idea of what had happened to him.   On September 19, 1996, more than a year and a half after he was first detained, Dolkar Kyap was tried in secret on charges of """"counterrevolution"""" and sentenced to a three-year term. At Gansu Provincial Prison No.2 where he was sent, he was the only Tibetan among the political prisoners. The prison produced leather shoes, carpets, and gloves, and included a iron smelting foundry on the premises; Dolkar Kyap was one of the glove makers.   Released in March 1998, Dolkar Kyap left for India permanently on November 29 the same year.   ******   On a government-sponsored pilgrimage to Lhasa in 1992, Trinley Gyatso, a young monk and student at the Gansu Buddhist Studies Institute, became better acquainted with the writings of the Dalai Lama and with Chinese attempts to interfere with Tibetan religious practice. Back at Labrang monastery in Gansu province, he helped organize the distribution of the materials he had collected and put up posters expressing his support of Tibetan independence.   He was arrested in July 1994 in Gansu. While awaiting trial for two years, Trinley Gyatso was allowed only one visit, from only one family member. Of his time in detention, Gyatso recalls:""""Sometimes they hit me all over my body with a sharp thin bamboo stick. My whole body became like a chicken, blue with patches of white."""" His shoulder joint was destroyed by a form of physical restraint used by security officers.   The trial itself lasted a bare three hours. It was not open to the public. The judges took ten minutes to reach a verdict of guilty and sentence him to a two-year and seven-month term.   After his release, Trinley Gyatso returned to his monastery, but friends got into trouble for their connection to him. He left for India in early 1998 without telling anyone he was going.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

It urged Indonesia's donors to continue to press Habibie to invite an international peacekeeping force to East Timor. The text of the September 6 decree had not been made public as of Tuesday morning, Jakarta time, but was expected to include authorization for the army to shoot on sight and make arrests without warrants. As many as 6,000 new army troops were expected to be sent to East Timor as a result. Indonesian officials gave no indication of how long martial law would last.  """"The army says the violence is out of control, but in fact, the army's behind it,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"It says pro-autonomy groups are clashing with pro-independence groups, but this is not a two-sided conflict. It's a one-sided, well-organized, premeditated rampage, led by fully armed militias and backed by local troops.""""  Jones said the militias were systematically attacking refugees, journalists, and people associated with the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET). """"The army organized and armed these militias in the first place,"""" she said. """"Since senior officers at any time could have arrested soldiers and militia leaders involved in murderous attacks but did not, why on earth should anyone believe that martial law and more troops will solve the problem?"""" Jones said the existing troops in East Timor did not need the extraordinary powers that martial law confers. """"They just need the political will to act,"""" she said. Human Rights Watch said it was concerned that with almost all international journalists out of East Timor and most foreigners evacuated save for some 100 UNAMET staff holed up in the UN compound in Dili, the army could now use martial law as a cover for furthering the work of the militias. """"One test will be whether members of the Aitarak militia, responsible for some of the worst violence over the last three days, will be arrested and charged,"""" Jones said. The international community has been urging Indonesia to either stop the violence or invite international forces in to do so.  A five-person delegation from the U.N. Security Council left for Jakarta Monday evening New York time with a mandate to insist that Indonesia take steps in the next forty-eight hours to curb the violence. The martial law decree appears to be Indonesia's response to growing international pressure to act. In interviews with Jakarta newspapers, General Wiranto continues to insist that Indonesia is fully capable of resolving the problem without international assistance and maintains that no international forces will be permitted in East Timor until November, when Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly, ratifies the results of the referendum held last August 30.

A copy of the letter follows. September 7, 1999 By Facsimile H.E. Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi Head of the Judiciary Tehran Islamic Republic of Iran Your Excellency: Congratulations on your recent appointment as head of Iran's judiciary. We are writing this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to urge you to do everything in your power to see that justice is served in the case of Islamic scholar and professor of philosophy Hojatoleslam Mohsen Kadivar. We understand that Dr. Kadivar is currently on """"compassionate leave"""" from Evin prison in Tehran but is due to be returned to prison in the near future to continue serving his jail term. Dr. Kadivar, a former aide to President Khatami, has been a vocal but peaceful proponent of democratization. Dr. Kadivar also is one of the founding members of the recently established Iranian Association for Defending Freedom of the Press. On April 21, 1999, Dr. Kadivar was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment by the Special Court for the Clergy (Dadgah-e Vizhe-ye Ruhaniyat) in Tehran. Dr. Kadivar had been detained since February 27, 1999, charged with """"propaganda against the sacred system of the Islamic Republic,"""" """"publishing lies,"""" and """"confusing public opinion"""" for ideas and views he had expressed in a series of essays, lectures, and newspaper articles. According to Iranian press reports dated July 25, 1999, his conviction subsequently was upheld on appeal. We understand, however, that, with recent changes in the judiciary, there is a possibility that there will be a new appeal and that Dr. Kadivar's arrest and conviction will be reconsidered by judicial authorities. As a group of academic leaders and scholars committed to academic freedom and protection of the basic rights of educators and students worldwide, it is not our intention to support or dispute the opinions, ideas, or research findings of the scholars and students whose cases we discuss. It is, however, a central feature of our mandate to defend their right to express their views as citizens and to study, research, teach, and publish without interference.  We believe that the arrest and sentencing of Dr. Kadivar for the peaceful expression of his views directly contravenes the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and violates Dr. Kadivar's internationally recognized rights to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as his right to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention. For the reasons set forth above, we urge you to use your influence and authority to ensure judicial review of Dr. Kadivar's case with a view to overturning his conviction. Should there be a retrial, we urge that you take all measures necessary to ensure that the new trial is conducted in accordance with international human rights standards and that Dr. Kadivar not be punished for peacefully exercising his basic right to express his views and ideas.

""""Indonesia seems bent on leaving East Timor the same bloody way it went in,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Western governments will be complicit in the killing if they fail to use any and every means possible to force the Indonesian government to either stop the militia violence or allow international peacekeepers in."""" Jones dismissed as """"nonsense"""" the suggestion that the militias—created, supported, and armed by the Indonesian army—were beyond Jakarta's control or that they were acting at the behest of """"rogue"""" elements of the armed forces.  """"The only evidence one needs of Jakarta's involvement is that some 15,000 army and police are in East Timor doing absolutely nothing to stop the terror, arrest the perpetrators, or protect the victims."""" """"This shows every sign of being planned and coordinated beforehand,"""" she said. """"The Indonesian army may be trying to teach a lesson not only to the East Timorese but to the people of Aceh and Irian Jaya. The lesson is: if you seek separation from Indonesia, even if support for separation is overwhelming, we will destroy you, and no outside power will come to your aid."""" She said it was absurd to explain the violence simply in terms of the pro-Indonesia militias being poor losers. The increasing invective over the last week in the Indonesian press and on the part of Jakarta-based politicians against the United Nations, Australia, and the U.S. was serving to discredit those most visibly involved in the referendum process. Human Rights Watch said Indonesia's major donors and trading parners, including the U.S., Australia, Japan, and the European Union should agree on coordinated and targeted sanctions, including suspension of direct budgetary support and other forms of non-humanitarian aid. That aid would be resumed if and when the violence was brought under control. Since it appeared that the Indonesian army had no intention of bringing the militias to heel, Human Rights Watch said, the leverage should be used to persuade President Habibie to accept an emergency international peacekeeping force. Military training and transfers of equipment—such as U.S.$5 million in aircraft parts pending from the U.S.—should also be halted. At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit convening in New Zealand later this week the crisis in East Timor, and coordinating sanctions should be a top priority. The main arguments against a peacekeeping force thus far have been that Indonesia would never agree (and without Indonesia's agreement, the Security Council would never approve), and that it would take too long to deploy. Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom have been reported at various times to be considering such a force that some have termed a """"Coalition of the Willing,"""" the bulk of whose forces would almost certainly have to come from Australia. If Indonesia gave a green light, a rapid deployment would probably be possible. But as of Sunday afternoon New York time, there was no evidence that the Indonesian government had changed its stance of rejecting international peacekeepers. In the meantime, East Timorese are being attacked in the schools and church compounds where they have sought refuge, most international journalists have left, and by Sunday evening Dili time, the militias were in control of most of the territory.  """"The international community paid for this referendum to happen,"""" said Jones. """"It sent more than 1,000 expatriate staff to Dili as part of the United Nations Mission in East Timor and hired more than 4,000 local staff, all of whom are in serious danger of militia attack because of their UNAMET association. Its failure to even try to use maximum leverage has turned these people into sitting ducks for militia gunfire.""""","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia",""

""""We are concerned that these members of the Jewish minority have been singled out to make a political point,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the organization's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Criminal trials should not be used as a gambit in the struggle within Iran's leadership. Trials should serve justice, not politics.""""  Human Rights Watch called on Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi to release the thirteen prisoners if they are not promptly charged with internationally recognized criminal offenses. If the thirteen prisoners are to be brought to trial they should be given immediate access to legal counsel of their choosing and allowed visits from their families and independent doctors. A copy of the letter is attached.  By Facsimile H.E. Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi Head of the Judiciary Tehran Islamic Republic of Iran September 2, 1999 Your Excellency: I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Head of Iran's Judiciary, and express the hope that under your leadership steps will be taken to bring the justice system of the Islamic Republic of Iran more fully into compliance with international human rights standards. We look forward to working with you in the time ahead towards this end. Human Rights Watch, an independent, nonpartisan organization working to uphold international human rights standards, is writing to you at this time to express its concern over the detention and reported forthcoming trial of thirteen Iranian Jews accused of involvement in espionage activities on behalf of the State of Israel. We are prompted to write by news reports that """"thirteen Jews and a few Muslims"""" have been """"handed over to the judiciary"""" for trial in Shiraz. On June 18, 1999, Human Rights Watch wrote to your predecessor, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, seeking assurances that the detention of these thirteen citizens was not founded upon their religious faith or their membership of a minority Jewish religious community. (A copy of the letter is attached.) As we received no response to that communication, we must reiterate our concern that the thirteen appear to be the victims of persecution because of their religion. As we hope Your Excellency will understand, we are particularly concerned that these members of the Jewish minority may have been singled out for persecution to make a political point, as a gambit in what is widely described as a struggle within Iran's leadership, rather than to serve justice. We very much hope that Your Excellency make every effort to ensure that these individuals are not to become innocent casualties of political forces, domestic or international, for which they bear no personal responsibility. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the evidentiary basis for the detention of the thirteen men has never been made public, and that fundamental safeguards against arbitrary detention and to ensure fair trial have been disregarded, in violation of Iran's obligations under international law. Article 9 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of which Iran is a party, provides that: """"Anyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest …"""" Article 14 (3)(b) of the covenant requires: that anyone charged with a criminal offense will """"have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing."""" The thirteen prisoners have been held in detention without access to lawyers and without visits from their family members for more than five months.  Human Rights Watch calls on Your Excellency to release the thirteen prisoners if they are not promptly charged with internationally recognizable criminal offenses. If they are to be brought to trial, the full text of the charges against them should be made public and the defendants should be given all of the safeguards and guarantees provided for in international fair trial standards, including the right to communicate promptly and freely with legal counsel of their own choosing. If a trial is to take place we request permission to send international observers to attend. Thank you for your consideration of this urgent matter, and I look forward to your early response.

The international monitoring organization called for all non-humanitarian aid, both bilateral and multilateral, to be halted as well and only resumed when some of the key militia leaders responsible for violence are behind bars. """"What are the donors waiting for?"""" asked Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Jones noted that the militias have been terrorizing East Timor with absolute impunity for nearly eight months. """"Unless these thugs are put behind bars, many more people are going to be killed, and the whole referendum process could literally go up in smoke."""" she said. Nearly 99 percent of the eligible voters in East Timor turned out for the historic referendum on Monday, despite widespread violence and intimidation by the Indonesian army-backed militias. The results of the referendum are expected to be announced next week, and many people in East Timor are worried that the militias will try to burn the ballot papers. The ballot boxes are all under guard in a museum in the Comoro district of Dili, close to the headquarters of UNAMET, the United Nations Mission in East Timor. The violence on Wednesday seems to have started around 4:00 p.m. when members of the Dili-based Aitarak militia attacked a group of independence supporters, many of them people displaced by earlier violence, just outside the U.N. compound. In that attack, one person identified by a local journalist as Jorges Francisco Bonaparte, nineteen, died from machete wounds. There were conflicting reports as to whether he was a militia member or an independence supporter. The militia also set fire to a nearby house and kiosk.  Some seventy members of the Indonesian Mobile Police Brigade (Brimob) who were accompanying a U.N. convoy from Maliana district to the UNAMET compound, were able to bring the situation under control. East Timorese reached by Human Rights Watch called the attack part of a concerted """"psy-war"""" against UNAMET. From the outset, the militias have accused the U.N. mission of supporting the pro- independence side, and they are clearly worried that the huge turnout on Monday will produce a vote in favor of an independent state. In an earlier, post-referendum attack, an East Timorese UNAMET worker was killed in the coffee-growing district of Ermera, possibly along with two others although their deaths remain unconfirmed. Journalists in East Timor have also been targeted. The accusations against UNAMET are being echoed in Jakarta's newspapers, with an editorial in the leading Muslim paper, Republika, on Tuesday accusing the U.N. of trying to undermine the Indonesian nation. It accused Australia and the U.S. in particular of wanting East Timor independent for their own strategic purposes.

The RUF agreed to immediately release all non-combatants in a May 18 cease-fire agreement, and again in the July 7 Peace Agreement. However, only 345 children have officially been released to date, out of thousands who are believed to have been abducted during eight years of civil war. The children are often used as combatants, laborers, and sex slaves.   In the same agreements, the RUF also promised to immediately release all prisoners of war. The RUF is thought to hold approximately 100 prisoners from ECOMOG, the West African peacekeeping force, and only eighteen have been released so far.   Human Rights Watch expressed hope that United Nations official Olara Otunnu, Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict, will pressure RUF leaders to honor their commitments. Otunnu's visit to Sierra Leone begins today, August 30.   """"These children have suffered more than enough,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa of Human Rights Watch. """"It is imperative that they be released so that they can go back to their families and villages, and enter rehabilitation programs.""""   In an August 30 letter to the rebel leader Corporal Sankoh, Human Rights Watch urged him to honor the agreements he signed, and reminded him of the July 28 order he gave to his commanders in which he stated, """"All commanders are hereby instructed to release immediately all remaining Prisoners of War and non-combatants by this instruction."""" Over one month later, this still has not been done, the letter noted.   The Human Rights Watch letter also stated that of the 345 children who have been officially released and some 650 who have either been unofficially released or managed to escape, all have come from the western and northern areas of rebel control. The letter questions why there have been no releases from the eastern rebel strongholds of Kono, Magburaka, and Kailahun. Those released represent only a fraction of the many thousands of children abducted by the rebel group during the country's eight year civil war. More than 3,000 children were reported missing during a January 1999 offensive on Freetown, the Sierra Leonean capital.   Human Rights Watch has collected extensive testimony from children who have recently been released by the RUF, some as young as seven years old. Excerpts from their testimonies are attached.   Testimonies from Sierra Leonean Children Abducted By Rebels   Many children describe witnessing atrocities against civilians, in some cases against their own parents. Almost all underwent military training. Some describe being coerced into taking drugs including ‘blue boats,' ‘white balls,' and marijuana to make them fearless in combat. One boy described how a ‘doctor' would inject a large group of children with drugs using a single needle for all. They said they were physically abused by rebels charged with ‘caring' for them, and many girls were also sexually abused.   UNICEF has described the children who have been released as """"malnourished, haggard, and in tattered clothing."""" Many have scabies and related skin diseases, sores and cuts, and many of the girls are pregnant.   Children testified that RUF rebels would inscribe """"AFRC"""" on their chests with a razor blade after abducting them, branding them permanently. AFRC refers to the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, the name of the rebel organization which ousted the democratically elected government in Sierra Leone in July 1997 and ruled the country until February 1998.   Brama, an eight-year-old boy who was abducted by the RUF in 1998, told Human Rights Watch of his experience during the January 1999 offensive on Freetown: I was afraid of the bullets. I could hear them whizzing by my head and I was right next to other people when they fell down, they died right near me...and then when all of us were running away we came to a place where they were burning everything, and I stood outside and watched. The rebels went to a house which was locked. The people were hiding inside, and pulled them out one by one. The people were screaming and the rebels cut their heads off...there were eight of them-even women. My heart was beating just about out of my chest. I felt so bad for these people, there were even children. Sometimes I even dream about it and sometimes I wake up suddenly, my heart beating, I sit up and can't sleep the whole night. Joseph, a ten-year-old boy abducted during January 1999, also witnessed the killing of many civilians. """"I was so scared,"""" he said. """"When I saw them killing, I was thinking I would be next.""""   Children as young as seven told Human Rights Watch they were coerced into killing and committing atrocities. One fourteen year old boy, Dennis, committed many killings and mutilations of civilians, and described removing the heart and liver from his victims to eat. He was originally abducted by the rebels in 1997 but managed to escape. After he found that his pregnant mother had been killed, he thought by an ECOMOG shell, he decided to return to the rebels to seek revenge.   Sahr, an eight-year-old boy, wanted to learn to use a gun so the others wouldn't accuse him of being a civilian. He told Human Rights Watch:  They said they would kill me if I cried... I missed my mother but I never thought of escaping because once, not too long after I'd been captured, a man tried to escape and when the rebels caught him, then brought him to the camp, cut off his head and placed it on a stick. I became so afraid and knew I must never, never try to escape because they'd kill me too.  Sia, a fourteen-year-old girl who was abducted in January and released in July, witnessed scores of atrocities against the civilian population during her seven months with the rebels.  Before January, I'd never seen someone run over by a car. But now the things I've seen - the blood those people have shed is too much. I feel like I've entered another world... I've seen people get their hands cut off, a ten-year-old girl raped and then die, and so many men and women burned alive in rice husks... So many times I just cried inside my heart because I didn't dare cry out loud. I'm so happy to be back with my family. I just want to go back to school and continue my education.  Abduction has long been the primary source of recruitment for the RUF. Some of the children described their captors as people who had themselves been abducted in earlier years of the war. The RUF and Government of Sierra Leone signed a peace agreement on July 7 in Lome, Togo which commits the RUF to lay down its arms in exchange for representation in a new government. It also includes a controversial general amnesty for all crimes committed during the civil war.   *Children's names have been changed to protect their privacy.","Africa, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights"

We also wish to remind you about the July 28, 1999 directive issued by you to all of your commanders in which you stated that """"... all commanders are hereby instructed to release immediately all remaining Prisoners of War and non-combatants by this instruction.""""

Many of the young girls were pregnant. Human Rights Watch believes the physical and physiological suffering endured by these children and adults has been profound. Particularly the children, who, according to recent testimonies taken by us in Freetown, have been forced to endure tremendous hardship, have been subjected to forced labor and sexual abuse, and have witnessed unspeakable atrocities committed by your troops. We believe their prompt release should be given the highest priority by your organization.

Local sources report that a bomb was detonated near an outside door at IPC's offices about 1 a.m. The offices are located in the city's Prado Centro neighborhood. Official reports indicate that the shock wave destroyed much of the office. A taxi driver who happened to be passing when the bomb exploded was treated and released from a nearby hospital.

There is in each country an especially pressing individual case requiring urgent action on humanitarian grounds. We therefore request that you raise these two cases in your talks with the respective governments, and ask that they take prompt and tangible steps to remedy the situation.  The first case involves Abraham Serfaty of Morocco. When you meet with King Muhammad VI and Prime Minister Yousoufi, please ask them to take immediate steps to allow Serfaty to return to his country. Serfaty, a member of a leftist opposition group and a proponent of independence for Western Sahara, had been arrested in 1974 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1977. He was released from Kenitra prison in September 1991, but promptly stripped of his Moroccan nationality and expelled to France, in violation of Moroccan and international law. Serfaty, now 73, despite his experience of torture and lengthy inhumane detention, has expressed his desire to spend his last years in his homeland, but the government has not yet responded to his October 1994 application for a passport. Serfaty's wife, Christine Daure-Serfaty, attempted to enter Morocco in early May 1999, reportedly after receiving private assurances from high government officials that she would be allowed to enter the country and plead his case, but she was detained at the airport and forced to return to France. We request that you ask the Moroccan authorities to act immediately to allow Abraham Serfaty to return from forced exile and to live with his wife in Morocco without harassment from the authorities.  The second case is that of Nizar Nayouf, an imprisoned human rights activist in Syria. We ask you to raise Nayouf's situation as a most urgent matter with President Asad. Nayouf has been serving a ten-year prison sentence following an unfair State Security Court trial in 1992. He has permanent spinal and other injuries as a result of torture in prison, and although he can move about only by crawling prison authorities have refused to provide him with a wheelchair. According to information we received late last year, Nayouf has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a lymphatic cancer that is treatable in its early stages. Syrian authorities have responded to Human Rights Watch that this diagnosis is incorrect but have refused to allow an independent medical examination. Nayouf has been denied proper medical treatment unless he renounces his political beliefs and signs an admission that he made """"false accusations concerning the human rights situation in Syria."""" Nayouf should never have been imprisoned in the first place, and now may face a life-threatening disease behind the bars of a solitary cell in a military prison. We urge you in the strongest terms to ask President Asad to release Nayouf immediately and unconditionally on humanitarian grounds, inasmuch as he has served two-thirds of his sentence, and to allow him to leave Syria if necessary for medical treatment. We believe that the Department of State is well-informed about both of these situations. By raising these two cases with the top leaders in Morocco and Syria, you can have a profound and beneficial impact on the well-being, and in one case the very survival, of individuals who are being severely and inhumanely punished solely for their political views. Please do not forego this opportunity.

That pressure should involve direct calls from the leaders of Indonesia's key donors, including German Chancellor Schroeder, Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi, Australian Prime Minister Howard, and U.S. President Bill Clinton, to Indonesian President Habibie. The leaders should warn the Indonesian president in no uncertain terms that aid programs and loans—except for humanitarian assistance and support to civil society—will be suspended immediately and be resumed only when serious steps are taken to improve the security situation in East Timor. Those steps should include holding Indonesian security forces and militia leaders accountable for their complicity in the violence. If that message is not delivered, Human Rights Watch said, not only East Timorese civilians but U.N. personnel and foreign journalists could be the next casualties.  On Thursday, four deaths were confirmed and at least one other appeared likely in the aftermath of violence linked to a pro-autonomy rally. Two pro-autonomy youths were stabbed to death in the Becora area of Dili, while at least two and perhaps three pro-independence people died from gunshot wounds. Reports, as yet unconfirmed, suggest that two of the latter were shot not by pro-autonomy militias but by an Indonesian army soldier and policeman respectively.  Virgilio da Silva and Apollinario Pinto da Silva, both from Viqueque and supporters of autonomy, were stabbed to death about 3:00 p.m. reportedly in a clash with pro-independence youths.  Anastacio Moniz died from his wounds at the headquarters of the UN Mission in East Timor after being shot nearby, reportedly by a soldier. A second youth, Baldinho (also seen as Bernadino) Gutteres, was reportedly shot by a Brimob (mobile police brigade) member in the Kuluhan area of Dili after shouting insults at the police for failing to stop violence by militia members. The militia was terrorizing the capital with guns, both homemade and automatic.  The Jakarta-based newspaper Kompas also said a person named Metta Araujo was among the dead; other reports said a high school student with a similar name who may be the same person had been shot and perhaps killed in the Kuluhan clash. Several others were shot and wounded, including a Kompas journalist, when either the militias or the Indonesian security forces opened fire, and two members of the Dili-based Aitarak (""""Thorn"""") militia were said to have been dragged from their car and remained missing as night fell in Dili.  The violence came as pro-autonomy supporters, backed by armed militias, staged a parade and rally in Dili as part of the campaign for the referendum to be held next Monday, August 30. Clashes broke out at different parts along the parade route. Near the residence of Bishop Belo in the Licidere district, youths threw stones at pro-autonomy marchers who tried to take down a flag of the pro-independence organization, Concelho Nacionale de Resistencia Timorense (CNRT). Elsewhere, the marchers vandalized the house of an ethnic Chinese, Lai Nee Cho, then burned his car and kiosk, according to Indonesian journalists. A few minutes later, a minivan with more pro-autonomy marchers arrived, and they were stoned by angry bystanders. One of the marchers was stabbed, according to this report, possibly one of the two named above who died.  The stabbing heightened tensions, and it was after this that militia forces armed with guns began firing, and attacked a hotel where foreign journalists was surrounded.  Despite repeated calls by the international community and UNAMET on the Indonesian government and military to cease support for the pro-autonomy militias and punish perpetrators of violence, no serious steps in that direction have occurred. The Aitarak militia's leader, Eurico Gutteres, has called on his supporters to block all roads out of Dili on August 31, the day after the vote, suggesting that if anything, violence is likely to increase, not end, after the referendum has taken place.  Several nongovernmental groups in and out of East Timor, as well as parliamentarians from Australia, Europe, and the United States, have called for U.N. peacekeepers to be sent to East Timor immediately. Under the terms of the May 5 agreement on the referendum, however, peacekeepers can only be deployed after Indonesia's highest legislative body has formally ratified the results of the referendum, and that is not likely to happen until November at the earliest and possibly even later. In the meantime, the U.N.Security Council is expected to approve on Friday an increase in the number of unarmed military liaison officers and civilian police, bringing the totals to 300 and 460 respectively.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia",""

But a potentially much more dangerous conflict is spiraling out of control in Aceh, the resource-rich region on the northern tip of Sumatra. The international community should be pressing Indonesia to address three of the key underlying causes of the conflict: failure to prosecute past abuses; failure to reduce a hated military presence; and diversion of locally-produced revenues to Jakarta. It's worth a try, but it may already be too late to stop a low-level insurgency from turning into what may be the most serious threat to Indonesian unity since it gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949. A quick comparison with East Timor is worth noting:  East Timor was never considered part of Indonesia until its forcible annexation in 1976. Aceh, the westernmost part of the Dutch East Indies, was integral to the Indonesian nationalist movement from the beginning. East Timor has some 800,000 people and few resources, although it produces coffee, and exploration for oil is continuing offshore. Aceh has four million people and is rich in oil, gas, timber, and minerals, as well as being an extremely fertile agricultural region. East Timor's guerrillas had no known international assistance in terms of arms or training. Aceh's guerrillas are reportedly receiving arms through Malaysia and Thailand, and some have received training in Libya. East Timor is overwhelmingly Catholic, and its people had strong support from the Catholic church worldwide and from the West, through the presence of large expatriate communities in Portugal and Australia. Aceh is overwhelmingly Muslim, and its sufferings, if not its independence struggle, have generated strong sympathy within Indonesia, and to some extent from Muslim communities abroad. There is a large expatriate community of Acehnese in Malaysia. East Timor's armed resistance had strong popular support from the outset. Aceh Merdeka's support in the late 1970s was largely restricted to one district, Aceh Pidie. From 1980 to 1989, it was quiescent. When it flared again in 1989, its guerrillas were present in more districts but its popular support was still limited. It has only emerged as a genuinely grassroots insurgency in the past six months.  There are three main reasons that the conflict has erupted so virulently, and that popular support for Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM or Free Aceh Movement) guerrillas has grown so fast: popular anger, the return of hundreds of guerrillas to Aceh from exile following the fall of Soeharto, and Indonesian military excesses. The anger stems from the Habibie government's refusal to address a near-universal demand in Aceh for justice. Between May 1990 and August 1998, Aceh was designated an area of military operations (daerah operasi militer or DOM) so that intensive counterinsurgency operations could be carried out against GAM. In 1989, a handful of guerrillas returned to Aceh from Libya where they had received training but no arms. Using weapons acquired largely from raids on military posts within Aceh, they carried out a series of attacks on soldiers and non-Acehnese migrants to the region. The Indonesian army responded with ferocious and indiscriminate force, killing more than a thousand civilians, often leaving their mutilated bodies by the side of roads or rivers. Many more were arrested, tortured, and arbitrarily detained for months, sometimes years. Hundreds of men disappeared. Many women whose husbands or sons were suspected of involvement with the guerrillas were raped. Aceh was under what amounted to total military control until late 1998, with civilian administrators effectively marginalized. Almost every family in the three districts of Aceh where military operations were concentrated was affected. In late July, I met with eleven young people, now in their twenties, whose fathers disappeared in 1990 and 1991. One of them remembers soldiers coming to his house and making him lead them to the ricefields where his father, suspected of giving food to the guerrillas, was working. When they got to the fields, his father wasn't there. As punishment, the soldiers put the boy's hand on the ground and systematically smashed all the fingers on one hand with a rock. He was twelve at the time; his hand remains misshapen today. His father was arrested shortly thereafter and has never been seen since. The cumulative impact of the DOM-era abuses was not felt until after President Soeharto stepped down in May 1998, and the political climate opened up. Then from June to August 1998, revelations of atrocities filled local newspapers and nightly television broadcasts, leading to expectations that military forces would be withdrawn, perpetrators prosecuted, and victims compensated. In August, General Wiranto, commander of Indonesia's armed forces, announced the formal ending of military operations, but a ceremony on August 31 to mark the withdrawal of troops turned into an ugly riot, as angry Acehnese stoned the soldiers, then went on a rampage through the city of Lhokseumawe. While the initial stoning may have been spontaneous, there is some evidence that the violence which followed involved local officers, unhappy at leaving lucrative extra budgetary sources of income, such as illegal logging and marijuana cultivation. Between August 1998 and the end of the year, not a single move was made to hold Indonesian soldiers accountable for atrocities, despite all the new information that had emerged. At the end of January 1999, an all-Aceh student congress proposed a referendum on Aceh's political status, and the idea caught fire across the province, taken up by activists, local government officials, and candidates for parliament in the June 1998 election. Moderate Acehnese leaders told Human Rights Watch in February 1999 that one trial of an officer for abuses during the DOM period could have halted the referendum movement in its tracks, but it didn't happen. Instead, GAM effectively took over from the students the task of popular mobilization, and the demand shifted from a referendum to independence. At the same time that more and more atrocities were coming to light, more and more GAM rebels were returning to Indonesia. Some of the top field commanders apparently returned to Aceh in a shipload of 545 Acehnese deportees, sent back from Malaysia in late March 1998. But many more returned following Soeharto's fall that May, mostly from Malaysia but also from Libya; some also emerged from hiding in Aceh itself. They began organizing throughout the districts of North Aceh, Pidie, and East Aceh and in some parts of West and South Aceh. According to residents of those areas we interviewed in late July, the main vehicle for getting the independence message across was the khotbah or sermon at the local mosque, and the message was simple: Aceh has been oppressed too long, and with independence, all citizens will have guaranteed employment, free education, and a free pilgrimage to Mecca. GAM leaders are also reportedly telling their followers that they have the support of twenty-three countries, and if East Timor could get as far as it has with the support of just one (Portugal), the prospects for Acehnese independence are bright. An activist who questioned the extent of GAM's international support found himself threatened several days later. As the movement gathered strength, fueled in large part by ham-handed army efforts to crush it, GAM leaders gradually took over some government functions. One woman from Lhokseumawe said when people want to get married in and around Kandang, a GAM stronghold on the outskirts of the city, they don't go to the Office of Religious Affairs any longer; they get GAM witnesses instead. It is the local GAM commander who settles disputes and signs documents for sale and purchase of land. The district court in Lhokseumawe has stopped functioning, all cases have been postponed, and most of the judges have moved to Medan, capital of North Sumatra, the province to the south. GAM has never been particularly respectful of human rights, and it's not now. More than one hundred """"executions"""" of suspected informers or cuak have taken place in Aceh since late 1998. While many in Aceh accuse the army of the killings in an effort to discredit GAM, many of these killings do appear to be the work of the guerrillas. One GAM rebel told a man who questioned the practice, """"We don't have resources to build a prison, so our prison is the ground."""" Dozens of government installations, including schools and subdistrict government offices, have been burned, and government employees attacked or threatened, and some people forced from their homes. Not all of the attacks attributed to GAM have necessarily been carried out by them; GAM has vigorously denied the school burnings, and reports abound of soldiers disguising themselves as members of a """"false GAM"""" and carrying out actions designed to look the real GAM look bad. Nevertheless, GAM abuses are real, and no one should romanticize the movement. But those abuses pale beside Indonesian army and police excesses. It's as though all the latter know how to do is open fire, and as the casualties mount, so does support for GAM. On May 3, security forces opened fire on a pro-independence rally, killing more than 40. On July 23 in West Aceh, a combined police and army force surrounded a religious school where it believed weapons had been hidden. The followers of the charismatic religious leader there, Teungku Bantaqiah, were mowed down by bullets as were the teungku and his wife. Over fifty bodies have been recovered from the site. Not a single soldier was wounded, suggesting the followers were unarmed, and reportedly only four weapons were found in the school. The army had earlier suggested that the school was a major ammunition and weapons depot for GAM. On August 1, the police commander for Aceh announced that a major new counterinsurgency operation, called Operation Sadar Rencong II, was being initiated that would involve at least 5,000 new police and army, added to the 5,000 troops already in place. The operation would also involve civilian militias, known as Wanra or Kamra, another virtual guarantee of human rights abuses if past experience is any guide. The operation, according to a local newspaper, was designed to secure the key road from Banda Aceh to Medan as well as the Strait of Malacca, and to hunt down arrest, and punish GAM members(1). That operation, given past history of botched operations and terrorization of the civilian population, is likely to mean disaster for ordinary Acehnese. The Indonesian government has a right to quell insurgencies and protect citizens within its borders, but that right does not mean license to kill, torture, or arbitrarily detain. In January, when soldiers beat to death several suspected GAM detainees, some of whom had no connection whatsoever to the movement, the army was quick to arrest and punish those responsible. But such quick action has not been repeated, and as the insurgency has grown stronger, the army's tendency has been to ignore or explain away human rights violations by its own members. What can the international community do? First, it can continue to press both President Habibie and General Wiranto for prosecutions of officers responsible for grave abuses during DOM. Habibie formally apologized to the people of Aceh for the abuses earlier this year, but such apologies carry no weight unless some form of redress, including prosecution in court, takes place. Second, it can urge the Indonesian government to reduce troop strength in Aceh. Such a reduction would be a huge confidence-building measure by the Indonesian government toward the Acehnese. True, the conflict is escalating, but in the past, more troops have just meant more massacres, and that pattern appears to be continuing. Moreover, fewer troops might force the government to explore non-military solutions. The Acehnese we interviewed also want a third party to mediate the conflict. The government thus far has rejected it out of hand; it does not want to give legitimacy to GAM.

The Coalition expressed disappointment, however, that the Council failed to call for stronger measures to stop the use of child soldiers.

""""But words alone are not going to help the 300,000 kids now serving in combat around the world. We're looking for concrete action.""""

In an August 11 letter to members of the Security Council, the Coalition made a series of recommendations for the Council's consideration. Among its recommendations, it urged the Security Council to: support a minimum age of eighteen for all recruitment and all participation in hostilities through the establishment of an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; encourage ratification of the Rome Statute for an International Criminal Court, which includes among its list of war crimes the conscription or enlistment of children under the age of fifteen into armed forces, or using them to participate actively in hostilities; increase monitoring the transfers of small arms, which are a significant and well-known contributor to the use of child soldiers; monitor commitments made by both governmental and non-governmental armed forces with respect to the non-recruitment of children; ensure that peace agreements include comprehensive demobilization programs that are specifically designed for child soldiers and which provide for family tracing and reunification, counseling, rehabilitation, and address the special educational and vocational needs of former child soldiers. The Coalition, formed in 1998, encompasses national campaigns in more than thirty countries worldwide. It is campaigning for an increase in the minimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities from the existing fifteen, to eighteen, through an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Despite five years of negotiations by a UN working group, the protocol has not yet been completed.  The Coalition is organizing a series of regional conferences on the use of child soldiers for representatives of governments and civil society. An African regional conference was held in Mozambique in April of this year, followed by a conference for Latin America and the Caribbean in July.

Should Insist On International Standards For Khmer Rouge Trial","","08/24/1999","Human Rights Watch today urged that any tribunal established to try Khmer Rouge leaders should adhere to the highest international standards. The group criticized as inadequate a U.N. proposal for a domestically-constituted tribunal in Cambodia with international participation, although it noted that the plan has some positive elements. A United Nations team is scheduled to arrive in Cambodia this week to discuss with the Cambodian government a proposed mixed tribunal, which, to date, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has rejected in public statements. A draft U.N. plan presented to the Security Council on July 30, 1999 calls for a Nuremberg-style joint trial of all defendants together, based on indictments prepared by an international prosecutor and approved by a predominantly non-Cambodian panel of judges.  Human Rights Watch praised the U.N. proposal's requirement that the Cambodian government be obligated to arrest all indicted Khmer Rouge leaders located in Cambodian territory.  But according to Human Rights Watch, the plan as currently formulated does not meet minimum benchmarks to ensure a legitimate and credible process in line with international standards (see appendix, attached). A U.N. Committee of Experts earlier this year recommended the establishment of an international tribunal held outside of Cambodia.  """"The United Nations must avoid giving legitimacy to a process that does not meet international standards,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.N. and key donors should withhold political and financial support if these standards are not met."""" She noted that the Cambodian government has a history of manipulating the judiciary and disregarding the rule of law.  The U.N. plan provides that the U.N. would appoint most of the judges, but it would also allow the Cambodian government to select the remaining judges, despite its record of intervening in the decision of those selected for judicial posts. In addition, no criteria are provided for selection of Cambodian judges. """"Any tribunal should be held under strict U.N. control,"""" said Jones. """"The Cambodian people deserve justice, not a show trial. Cambodia has already had one of those, after the Khmer Rouge fell from power in 1979.""""  The proposal fails to require the government to cooperate with the court in many other key ways--by enforcing the court's orders, preserving evidence, providing access to witnesses, opening government files and records, providing adequate protective measures for victims and witnesses, and ensuring humane treatment of those in detention.  """"Witnesses and defendants have often been tortured in Cambodia,"""" said Jones. """"This tribunal would fail to give them protection, and that's a very serious omission.""""  The U.N. plan also fails to insist that Cambodia cooperate in attempting to apprehend suspects who have fled its territory, leaving open the possibility of government collusion to shield cooperative former Khmer Rouge leaders by allowing them to quietly disappear quietly over the border.  Other legal deficiencies include the absence of any right of appeal, failure to allow defendants recourse to lawyers of their choice, including foreign defense counsel, and failure to preclude royal pardons for convictions by the tribunal.  The U.N. is not expected to make a decision about sending legal experts to Cambodia to help in drafting a law to establish a tribunal until the U.N. mission reports back on this week's talks.","Asia, Cambodia","International Justice, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/08/24/minimum-benchmarks-khmer-rouge-tribunal","Minimum Benchmarks for a Khmer Rouge Tribunal","Minimum Benchmarks for a Khmer Rouge Tribunal","","08/24/1999","Human Rights Watch continues to believe that justice is best served by a fully international tribunal. In the event, however, that a tribunal is established under Cambodian law, Human Rights Watch considers the following to be minimal acceptable benchmarks for a credible and legitimate tribunal: 1. Legal Basis of the Tribunal. The tribunal should be subject to conditions established by the United Nations, which should be included in a statute drafted by the United Nations. The statute should define the tribunal's jurisdiction, competence, composition, fair trial guarantees and rules of procedure in accordance with international standards and precedents of the two existing ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.   To meet these conditions, and others which follow in this appendix, a new, special tribunal must be created. Trials must not take place in the existing Cambodian court system, which is incapable of meeting minimum standards of due process and fairness. The current U.N. proposal does not specify a statute for a new tribunal or U.N. drafting or approval of such a statute.     2. Organization of the Tribunal. A new tribunal would require at least one and possibly more trial chambers (depending on the case load) and an appellate division. The decision of the appellate division must be final.     The legal framework establishing the tribunal should not allow any appeal to a Cambodian court or to the Cambodian Constitutional Council, which would have the effect of nullifying the independence of the tribunal by rendering it subordinate to the Cambodian judiciary. The present U.N. proposal does not include any form of appellate division or right of appeal, a violation of Article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty to which Cambodia is a party.     3. Personnel. It is essential for the independence and credibility of the tribunal that the United Nations retain control over the selection of the judges, the prosecutor and the staff, whether they are international or Cambodian. The chief prosecutor, a majority of judges and the Registrar (the tribunal's chief administrative officer) should be non-Cambodians. The United Nations Group of Experts contemplated the inclusion of a small minority of Cambodian judges and prosecutors. The actual mix is less important than the selection process, however. The imposition of tribunal personnel by political factions in Cambodia would destroy the tribunal's credibility in the eyes of Cambodians and should render it unacceptable to the international community as well. Ideally, the U.N. Secretary-General or a panel named by him would propose key appointments of both Cambodians and non-Cambodians, though the Cambodian Supreme Council of Magistracy could forward names for the former to the Secretary-General. Cambodians selected could be sent to The Hague for training in international legal standards. All appointments of international staff should be made through the U.N. and as staff of the U.N.     The U.N. proposal, while specifying that the prosecutor and a majority of the judges be international, does not require U.N. approval for Cambodian judges, nor does it set any requirements for their qualifications, although foreign judges are to be """"persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices.""""     In addition the U.N. proposal should include provisions that defendants have the rights to counsel of their choice, including attorneys of any nationality.     4. Subject Matter Jurisdiction. The tribunal should have jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, genocide, forced labor and torture, as set forth in the Group of Experts report. The definitions of these crimes should be drawn from the statutes of the two ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court.     5. Personal jurisdiction. The Group of Experts properly recommended that the tribunal be established to bring to justice """"those persons most responsible for the most serious violations of international human rights law.""""     6. Cooperation. The U.N. proposal only requires cooperation with respect to arrest of suspects. The Cambodian government must agree to give its complete cooperation with the Tribunal, including opening all its files and complying with Tribunal resolutions and orders, including for the arrest of suspects.     7. Protection of Witnesses and Personnel. Joint U.N. - government programs must be established for the protection of witnesses and the security of all other participants, including judges and lawyers as well as investigators and defendants and prisoners. This protection must be available from the earliest investigatory stage through post-trial measures. In particular, the court must be able to take security measures to protect witnesses and victims and their families from reprisals. Such measures must not prejudice the rights of suspects and accused.     8. Fair Trial and Due Process. The tribunal should ensure the highest international standards of fair trial and due process at all stages of the proceedings. Particularly given the mistrust of official institutions, which runs so deep in Cambodia, justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done. Therefore, the tribunal must be scrupulous in its respect for international standards including Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Articles 9, 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment; and Articles 7 and 15 of the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.     The U.N.'s proposal for holding joint trials of more than one defendant at one time threatens these standards. A joint trial may prejudice both the rights of defendants and the ability of the prosecution to mount an effective and well-supported case. The decision whether trials should proceed jointly or separately should be left to the prosecutor, with review on defense motion by the tribunal. Any arbitrary time limit would make a mockery of the tribunal's mandate to bring to trial those most responsible for the gross abuses of the Khmer Rouge.     9. Death penalty. There should be no provision for the death penalty, in accordance with the statutes of the International Tribunals established for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court, as well as the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.     10. Pardons. There is no mention of whether royal pardons may apply to the tribunal in the U.N. proposal. A royal pardon could rob the whole effort of legitimacy by undermining the decisions of the tribunal. Pardons should therefore be barred.     11. Financing. A U.N. trust fund should be established to pay for the tribunal. The Registrar and the chief financial officer maintaining control over funds must be selected by the United Nations. The tribunal should exist and operate so long as it has financing and viable cases within its jurisdiction are still being investigated or being brought to trial.","Asia, Cambodia","International Justice, United Nations"

The international monitoring group called on the World Bank along with the U.S. and Australian governments to make high level appeals for immediate access to the detained Tibetan translator, Tsering Dorje, and call for his release. Dorje was hired as a Chinese language translator by an American, Daja Meston, and an Australian, Gabriel Lafitte. All three men were picked up by Chinese state security officials in Xiangride, a town on the edge of the Bank project area in Qinghai province, on August 15, 1999. Dorje's current whereabouts are unknown. """"We're relieved at China's decision to release Mr. Lafitte this past weekend,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But we are deeply concerned about Tsering Dorje and the American still in custody. We've documented many cases of Tibetans being tortured during interrogation. There is real potential for those associated with foreigners considered ‘hostile' to China's official interests to be severely mistreated and given a long prison sentence,"""" he added.  Dorje, a teacher in his mid-twenties from a traditional Tibetan village, is a Chinese citizen. In October 1998, he served as an official translator for a delegation from the European Union visiting Qinghai province and Tibet. He has also provided translation assistance to private, Western-based humanitarian organizations working in China. Gabriel Lafitte was released on August 21 and returned to Australia following high level appeals from the World Bank and interventions by the Australian government. Jiang Zemin, China's president, is due to arrive in Australia on September 5. Lafitte told Human Rights Watch that he was subject to hours of intense interrogation, though he was not physically mistreated. As a Tibetan and a Chinese citizen, Dorje is clearly at serious risk of the kinds of abuses Human Rights Watch has documented in prisons in Tibet and elsewhere in China including beatings, forced confessions, deprivation of proper medical care, and prolonged periods of isolation. """"The World Bank should make it clear that it will hold Beijing responsible for the mistreatment of either Chinese citizens or foreigners who try to visit the Bank-funded resettlement project,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"The Bank should warn Chinese officials that these abuses may make it difficult, if not impossible, for donors to fund the project."""" On June 24, 1999, the World Bank's board of directors approved a $160 million poverty reduction project that includes plans for the voluntary resettling of 57,750 farmers to a traditionally Tibetan ethnic area of Qinghai province, on the condition that China would open up the project area to access by outside visitors. Daja Meston, the U.S. citizen detained in Qinghai, remains in a Xining hospital, where he is being treated for a broken back and other serious injuries he received while in official custody. Chinese authorities say he jumped from the third floor while trying to escape. Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. to insist on a thorough investigation of all three men's detention and treatment in custody.","Asia, China and Tibet",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/08/20/jakartas-east-timor-tightrope","Jakartas East Timor Tightrope","Jakarta's East Timor Tightrope","","08/20/1999","On Aug. 30, barring further delays, the people of East Timor will vote on whether they wish to remain part of Indonesia as an autonomous region or form an independent state. Virtually all eligible voters, almost 450,000, have now registered, despite violence and intimidation from Indonesian army-backed groups to prevent them from doing so. But there are worrying signs that violence could yet mar the election and its aftermath. The government of President B.J. Habibie is putting international goodwill at risk by using proxy militias and other methods to try to rig the ballot in favor of autonomy. Indonesia's donors, including Japan, Australia, the U.S. and Europe, should make clear that any attempt to derail the election by Indonesian forces will jeopardize international assistance earmarked for Indonesia's democratization and economic recovery process. There are several ways the government can derail the election. One is to cause violence during the campaign period, now scheduled to end on Aug. 27. Another is to step up militia violence on the day of the vote itself. A third is to have the losers, almost certainly the pro-autonomy side, contest the vote in a way that delays official endorsement of the results by Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly. Finally, the army may try to spark civil war or create a movement for partition, with a few districts in the west rejecting incorporation into the new state. Why would Indonesia risk its international standing and relations with aid donors to keep East Timor? There are three main reasons: -- The Indonesian army is worried that if East Timor becomes independent, separatist movements in Indonesia proper will step up their struggles. A long-simmering insurgency in resource-rich Aceh on the island of Sumatra has spiraled out of control in the last six months, with guerrillas in control of more territory and commanding more popular support than ever before. It is true that in both Aceh and Irian Jaya armed and unarmed independence movements have been encouraged by developments in East Timor to think that a referendum might be possible for them as well. But it is a fundamental misreading of the dynamics of both movements to think, as the Indonesian government seems to, that if East Timor votes to remain within Indonesia, popular grievances that have been fueling political violence in Aceh and Irian Jaya will evaporate. People there harbor deep grievances against Jakarta, from failure to prosecute massive human rights abuses to systematic stripping of natural resources. The army is wrong to think that separatist movements elsewhere will go away if it rigs the vote in East Timor. -- The Indonesian army and parts of the bureaucracy may also be trying to wreck the ballot because the United Nations presence represents a major national humiliation. It is proof that a 24-year effort at integration has failed. When Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials signed the agreement with Portugal and the United Nations on May 5 authorizing the ballot and the creation of the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, they may not have realized how galling the presence of close to 1,000 foreigners in East Timor would be to the army, particularly to the officers in direct control of operations there. This may be one reason that Unamet offices and staff have become the target of militia attacks. -- Many senior Indonesian officials outside the military claim that there is substantial pro-Indonesian sentiment in East Timor and that it is the pro-independence forces, not army-backed militias, that are causing the bulk of the intimidation and harassment. They say the primary conflict is not between the Indonesian government and the people of East Timor, but between warring groups of East Timorese. They argue that the pro-independence forces have an unfair advantage in support from the West, the Catholic Church, and now the United Nations. It is therefore incumbent upon Jakarta to establish a level playing field by helping the East Timorese who want to stay in the fold. But the core of the Pro-Indonesia side may not be more than 10% to 12% of the voting population concentrated in the western districts near the border with West Timor.  It consists primarily of three groups: local officials whose authority stems from their links to the Indonesian bureaucracy; a few hundred former guerillas who changed sides through coercion or persuasion and who may fear retaliation when Indonesia leaves; and a tiny group of intellectuals who believe that East Timor stands no chance of survival as an independent state. Money, however, has swelled their ranks. Funds from Jakarta have enabled local officials to recruit thousands of unemployed East Timorese into pro-integration paramilitary groups. The notion that the conflict in East Timor is among East Timorese rather than between them and the Indonesian state ignores the fact that for the last 10 years Indonesian policy has been to create these paramilitary groups precisely to pit East Timorese against each other. If East Timor is a house divided, it is largely the Indonesian army's doing. Likewise, the charge that pro-independence groups are responsible for widespread intimidation and terror against pro-Indonesia civilians is simply not supported by evidence. It is true that such intimidation was common in late 1998, when a wave of attacks on non-Timorese migrants took place, and there have been sporadic attacks on suspected militia members since. But the vast majority of people displaced by violence -- at least 40,000 at last count -- fled pro-integration militia attacks, not terror from the pro-independence guerrilla army or its civilian supporters. Moreover, whereas Indonesian officials have shown no hesitation in arresting suspected perpetrators of violence from the pro-independence camp, not a single militia member was arrested from January to July, despite well-documented attacks with identifiable perpetrators that caused hundreds of deaths. It was only after international outrage at a militia attack on a humanitarian convoy on July 4 that seven suspects, all in their teens or 20s, were arrested and put on trial.  Militia commanders remain immune from prosecution, and army and police as of early August were continuing to stand by or actively participate in militia attacks. Despite the surprising success of the registration process, there are strong indications that the army and its proxies will pull out all stops to sabotage the ballot. Indonesia's major donors need to send a strong message to the government that any such action would cause irreparable harm to their relationships. The heads of state of Japan, Australia, Germany, Britain and the U.S. should communicate directly not only to President Habibie, but also to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and General Wiranto, that a record $5.9 billion pledged to Indonesia in a donor consortium meeting last month in Paris will be at stake if state-supported violence continues. So will all military-to-military links, already damaged in many cases by Indonesian army behavior in East Timor and elsewhere. Indonesia badly needs some political and economic breathing room to get its own house in order. It only hurts itself if it continues its current course in East Timor.

In July, Moloney was served with an order issued by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland's police force, requiring him to surrender notes from confidential interviews conducted in 1990 with William Alfred Stobie. Stobie was arrested in June 1999 and charged with the murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane, who was killed by loyalist gunmen in 1989. With Stobie's permission, Moloney used the notes from the 1990 interviews for the first time as the basis for stories published in the Dublin-based Sunday Tribune on June 27, 1999. The stories alleged police collusion in Finucane's murder. Subsequently, Stobie testified in court that he had been a police informant at the time of the killing.  """"The government's utter disregard for Moloney's security is striking,"""" said Julia Hall, Counsel in the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"The mounting evidence of state-sponsored collusion in the Finucane murder should be the government's focus, not going after a journalist who must, by the nature of his profession and in the context of on-going violence in Northern Ireland, keep his sources confidential. Human Rights Watch urged the government to halt its pursuit of Moloney, and renewed its call for an independent judicial inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane. The letter to Prime Minister Blair is below. A similar letter was sent to Secretary Mowlam. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- August 19, 1999 Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP Prime Minister 10 Downing Street London SW1A 0AA United Kingdom By fax: 011.44.171.925.0918 Dear Prime Minister Blair:  Human Rights Watch is writing to express concern about the order served on journalist Ed Moloney, Northern Ireland editor of the Sunday Tribune, requiring him to release interview notes taken nine years ago regarding claims of security force collusion in the murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane in 1989. Forcing Mr. Moloney to reveal these confidential materials, given the particular circumstances of this case, could have an immediate chilling effect on free inquiry into government accountability in Northern Ireland.  The implication of this disclosure order, given the government's longstanding refusal to institute a judicial inquiry into collusion in the Finucane murder, suggests that a journalist who sought evidence of government wrongdoing has become the target of government harassment. This can be read as a signal that independent journalists and those they interview may face not only the threat of extralegal violence but official acts that increase their exposure to such violence. This discourages the kind of independent inquiry essential to accountability in a democratic society, while putting citizens who contemplate talking in confidence to a journalist on notice that doing so could endanger them and others.  A journalist who investigates and publishes reports concerning possible government collusion in political crimes, in the context of violence of often uncertain provenance, faces a particular responsibility to protect sources and related journalistic material. Threats and violence against those critical of the security forces in Northern Ireland, and the lack of confidence in the security forces' impartiality, provides part of the context of this case. The added threat of judicial action to force those investigating collusion to disclose what may constitute evidence of gross human rights abuse contrasts vividly, in turn, with the lack of transparency and the very limited nature of the government's inquiries into collusion since the Finucane murder.  Notwithstanding the real progress toward peace in Northern Ireland, there has been little progress in building confidence in the government's response to allegations of collusion. Coercing journalists who have themselves explored collusion—while shielding the security services from a judicial inquiry—could further undermine this. It is both Northern Ireland's context of violence and the record of the government's past response to allegations of collusion that should inform the authorities' decisions regarding access to journalists' confidential notebooks. At issue is the safety of journalists and those who meet with them in Northern Ireland with regard to issues of government accountability. There is a particular need for the government to acknowledge the special needs of the press in Northern Ireland to safeguard themselves and their sources from extralegal assault—and to protect them from intimidation. Forcing Moloney to reveal sources and notes could put him and others in real physical danger, while effectively silencing others who might otherwise speak out on collusion. In a related case, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was applied following the broadcast of a television documentary on collusion in November 1991. Interview notes were demanded from Channel Four/Box Productions. In that case, which centered on the trial of Brian Nelson, confidential information that was provided to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) after the showing of the program led to aggressive and intimidating RUC interrogations of many of those who had cooperated with the program. This appeared to have been an unabashed effort to discredit statements critical of the security forces. At the same time, sensitive information, including the names of sources, was reportedly leaked to selected newspapers, apparently by the RUC, exposing them to possible violent retaliation.  Ed Moloney was served with an order in July 1999 to surrender notes from interviews conducted in 1990 with William Alfred Stobie. At Stobie's specific request, the notes were kept in confidence until this year. They were not used to produce a news story until June 27, 1999, after Stobie was arrested and charged with the murder of Patrick Finucane. The arrest prompted Stobie to give Ed Moloney permission to use the interview notes to tell Stobie's story. Subsequently, Stobie claimed in court that he was a police informer at the time of Finucane's murder and that he had told the police twice that a murder was about to take place. Moloney's June 27 story in the Sunday Tribune recounted this information and included details from the Stobie interviews about Stobie's prior arrest and aborted trial for alleged illegal arms possession in 1990. The article alleged that officials decided not to prosecute Stobie on the arms possession charges because he had information about security force involvement in the Finucane murder. Human Rights Watch has written to you several times in the past regarding the Finucane murder. We have called repeatedly for an independent judicial inquiry into the murder and those calls became ever more urgent in light of Stobie's recent arrest and credible claim that he was a police informant at the time of Finucane's murder. Ed Moloney's June 1999 articles in the Sunday Tribune recount the information that Stobie is said to have channeled to the police at the time of the murder and asserts that the police did nothing to halt the Finucane murder or to find the actual perpetrators in its aftermath. Thus, it appears that the police are now seeking the disclosure of information that they already possess. Human Rights Watch urges the U.K. government to halt its pursuit of Ed Moloney. We call on the government once again to establish a full public judicial inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane in order to hold accountable those truly responsible for and those implicated in his murder.

The fighting is between Rwandan and Ugandan regular forces backing competing factions of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD). The headquarters of the Wamba faction is at the Hotel Wagenia, located in central Kisangani, the third largest Congolese city and home to about a million inhabitants.  Residents in this heavily populated area are thus placed in a deadly crossfire zone.  Dozens of civilians are believed to have died already and many more were reportedly wounded as the hotel came under heavy attack on Tuesday.  The city streets remained deserted as a tense truce prevailed on Wednesday. This confrontation between Rwanda and Uganda and their respective rebel allies occurred in the middle of what was supposed to be a truce allowing the vaccination against polio and other deadly childhood diseases for Congolese children in Kisangani and the eastern province of Congo. The Congolese government had agreed to the vaccination campaign in rebel-held areas, and all parties had endorsed a vaccination truce. The fighting this week in Kisangani trapped hundreds of women and children in vaccination centers as the streets turned into battlefields. """"The war had already reduced the population in Kisangani to grinding poverty, said Suliman Baldo, the Congo researcher at the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.  """"The parties to the current fighting are placing civilians in mortal danger -- with food, medical supplies and other essentials reaching dangerously low levels."""" Human Rights Watch condemned the callous disregard for civilian life shown by Rwandan and Ugandan forces and their allies in the current crisis in Kisangani. """"International humanitarian law provides for the protection of civilians and materials essential to their survival, including electric power, foodstuffs and drinking water,"""" noted Baldo. Human Rights Watch urged Rwanda and Uganda to prohibit their troops and allies in Kisangani from attacking civilians or structures and supplies essential to the survival of the civilian population.  It urged the warring parties to strictly enforce the truce declared between them so that stranded civilians could reach safety and health workers could treat the wounded and bury the dead. The organization urged the international community and humanitarian agencies to intervene more forcefully to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in Kisangani. The fighting originally erupted over which rebel faction was qualified to sign a cease-fire agreement purporting to end to the year-old war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The government of President Kabila and three southern African governments backing Kabila's forces against the RCD signed the agreement on July 10, as did Rwanda and Uganda. Rivalry between the two rebel factions prevented the RCD from joining the truce.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",""

The attorney for four of the men reported that all six defendants, including the brothers of exiled political opposition leader Muhammad Solih, testified that they had been cruelly and repeatedly tortured. A statement signed by all six claimed that torture methods included electric shocks, beatings with batons and plastic bottles filled with water, and the use of the """"bag of death,"""" a plastic bag used to temporarily suffocate victims. Authorities forced all six—Muhammad Bekjanov, Rashid Bekjanov, Kobil Dierov, Mamadali Mahmudov, Ne'mat Sharipov, and Iusuf Ruzimuradov—to sign self-incriminating statements and coerced several to declare their guilt on a government-sponsored national television program. """"This is an appalling example of political persecution,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"These men were arrested, tortured and now convicted for possession of a banned newspaper, for their political affiliation and for no other reason."""" The six men were convicted because of their alleged affiliation with Erk (Freedom), a political party, founded in 1990 and banned by Uzbek authorities in December 1992. Its leader, Muhammad Solih, was the only candidate to run against President Islam Karimov in the presidential elections of 1991. He was forced into exile in 1994, fleeing arrest on fabricated criminal charges. This latest round of political arrests and convictions comes against a backdrop of widespread arbitrary and discriminatory arrests following the February 16 bombings in Tashkent. The government has publicly implicated Solih as a conspirator in the bombings, a charge he denies. Uzbek authorities barred local and international observers from attending the trial, including representatives from the OSCE Liaison Office. One defendant, however, managed to deliver a copy of his court testimony to Human Rights Watch. In it, renowned writer Mamadali Mahmudov describes the horrifying torture methods and threats used by Uzbek authorities to force him to confess: """"...in the basement, they regularly beat me...they burned my legs and arms. They put a [gas mask] on me and cut off the air...[and] hung me up by my hands, which they tied behind my back."""" """"They told me they were holding my wife and daughters and threatened to rape them in front of my eyes."""" The other five defendants also reported that authorities threatened to rape their wives. Officers also allegedly threatened to rape Mahmudov and tormented him, describing the various ways in which they would kill him.  Mahmudov's allegations are consistent with Human Rights Watch's documentation of torture methods routinely used by Uzbek authorities. Persons held incommunicado, as Mahmudov and the other defendants were for several months, are particularly at risk for abuse. Authorities allegedly kept Mahmudov in a basement detention cell, the location of which was unknown even to him, for the first month and a half of his detention.  The state's case focused on the defendants' alleged possession and distribution of Erk (the party's newspaper), which the prosecutor claimed contains slanderous criticisms of the President of Uzbekistan, a violation of the criminal code's article 158 (3). Erk was the last of the opposition newspapers to be published in Uzbekistan before it was banned by the government in 1993. Other charges included conspiracy to overthrow the government and participation in an illegal or banned organization. Without access to court documents or the presence of trial observers, it remains unclear exactly which articles or statements in the paper the court found objectionable, as do the grounds for the charges. However, the timing of the charges and the conduct of the case point to political motives. Uzbek authorities' conduct of the arrest and trial of the six men violated domestic criminal procedure and international standards. All were held incommunicado in Uzbekistan for long periods prior to trial. On the first day of the hearings, attended by Human Rights Watch before the proceedings were sealed, the court was forced to postpone the process because the authorities had not acquainted defendants with the charges against them. After the trial had already begun, one defendant stood up and announced that he still was without a lawyer, five months after his arrest. Mamadali Mahmudov, 50, wrote The Immortal Cliffs, a novel which helped lay the foundation for Uzbek national self-awareness in the late Soviet period. He was twice before arrested on criminal charges in retaliation for his association with Erk. In 1995 he was sentenced to four years in prison, but was later amnestied. Ne'mat Sharipov, the defendant who received the shortest sentence, eight years, is a businessman who is not a member of Erk and whose only connection to the opposition party was his alleged transport of several copies of a book by Muhammad Solih from Ukraine to Uzbekistan. Four of the men—Muhammad Bekjanov, Iusuf Ruzimuradov, Kobil Diyarov and Ne'mat Sharipov—were extradited from Ukraine by Uzbek authorities in March.

Rouzi regularly broadcasts for Voice of America and Radio Free Asia; the arrest of Rebiya Kadeer and others close to her may be linked to his activities, although the charges against them have not been made public. Kadeer and two other women were taken into custody at 7:00 a.m. on August 11 in front of the Yingdu Hotel in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, where they had gone to meet a group of visiting Americans.

Two other sons living in the town of Aksu were placed under house arrest. Kadeer's secretary, Kahriman Abdukirim, was also picked up. He had only been released on August 7 after spending more than eight months in incommunicado detention without charge, apparently because of political discussions he had taken part in as a college student.

She and her friends each had both hands hacked off - as part of a strategy by the rebels to terrorize the local population. Rebel forces in Sierra Leone systematically murdered, mutilated and raped civilians during their efforts to capture Freetown early this year. The rebels carried out large numbers of pre-meditated mutilations of civilians, in particular the amputation of arms, hands, legs and other parts of the body.   The victims of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone have no international tribunal to look to for justice for the murder, torture and mutilation there. The plight of the juvenile amputees underscores the humanitarian imperative in the early establishment of the permanent International Criminal Court agreed to in Rome last summer. One year after the completion of the treaty creating the ICC, eighty-three states, including all of the United States's closest allies, have committed themselves to supporting the Court.   The groundwork for ratification of the treaty is being laid at regional conferences of states and nongovernmental partners from southern Africa to the Caribbean. Resolutions from the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth Law Ministers and other parliamentarians are infusing the momentum with a sense of inevitability. With sufficient political will, the establishment of the ICC is now a matter of time.   Last week, negotiators resumed work at UN headquarters on the Court's rules of procedure and evidence, along with the elements for proving war crimes. The meeting room, packed as never before with delegates from around the world, generated an almost palpable sense of expectation that the Court was coming to life and its birth was likely to be quite a bit sooner than anyone had expected. It is quite a distance from this time last year when the US insisted on a weakened Court and then threatened to kill the Court when its views were not accepted.   While the ill-conceived threats of active US opposition to the ICC have not chilled enthusiasm among the states supporting the Court, unfortunately, Washington is still seeking to eviscerate the Court behind closed doors. It is past time for Washington to recognize the train is leaving the station and the US is in danger of being left standing on the platform. This prospect is extremely embarrassing for the Clinton Administration which already found itself - alone with only six other states, including China, Iraq, and Libya - shamefully voting against the Court treaty in July 1998.   US opposition to this new international law enforcement institution undercuts the credibility of its efforts to bring other war criminals like Slobodan Milosevic to justice. But Washington's illogical hostility to the ICC is more than a public relations disaster. It is a policy catastrophe. In operational terms, among the 19 members of NATO, only the US and Turkey have not signed the treaty. This could create real problems in any future NATO actions.   The rigid US government opposition is all the more perplexing because American negotiators obtained nearly all of the demands they made in the treaty negotiations. Motivated by the desire to prevent politically triggered cases against American servicemen and policy-makers, the US delegation achieved more than 90% of its objectives in the treaty negotiations. But the US is still insisting on an exemption for American citizens in the form of an ironclad guarantee that no American would ever appear before the ICC. No matter how much states want the US on board, they have rejected this impossible demand.   The US delegation is currently conducting intensive bilateral meetings at the UN and looking for a """"fix"""" that will get it out of the corner it short-sightedly painted itself into. Because of the value of active US support for the Court, states want to bring the American on board - but not at the price of destroying the ICC's effectiveness and credibility. The reports from the US-convened bilaterals these last two weeks indicate Washington """"just doesn't get it."""" The US is serving up a combination of old and new proposals that are totally unacceptable.   The word in the corridors at the UN is that US officials are soliciting acceptance for two basic demands. The American delegation wants a """"binding formula"""" which would ensure """"maximum protection"""" for US servicemen engaged in """"official duties"""" in international security operations. This, of course, would not only apply to Americans and would be generalized to mean protection for individuals of any state involved in these operations. It is a similar proposal to the one the Americans floated at the eleventh hour in Rome and was decisively rejected because of the obvious loopholes it would create. This stale provision - which future Saddam Husseins would surely invoke when their troops invade a Kuwait - is no more acceptable now than it was a year ago.   In situations where individuals (meaning Americans, but again applying to all accused equally) were under investigation by the ICC, the US is seeking to deny the ICC judges the ultimate decision-making authority to find that the national authorities have failed to investigate or prosecute crimes. This failure by national court is the prerequisite for any ICC action. Some reports indicate the US wants the state of the nationality of the accused to make the decision whether the ICC can prosecute. Other reports suggest the US is proposing a vaguely formulated committee of eminent jurists which would, instead of the ICC, make the decision on admissibility. In either case, the American proposal seeks to deny the Court the authority to determine its own docket.   The US needs to respect the integrity of the ICC treaty and make proposals consistent with the text approved by a vote of 120 states to 7. Rather than try to obtain through the backdoor what they couldn't gain through last year's negotiations, the US must identify a realistic bottom line. It must seek through the negotiations on rules of procedure and elements of crimes assurances, that while not ironclad, will provide additional reassurance.

""""Women are being killed by family members who find their behavior improper. Jordanian law excuses these murders as somehow justified--which completely devalues women's lives,"""" said Regan E. Ralph, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights division. An average of twenty-five to thirty women are killed in Jordan each year in the name of honor. In most cases, a girl or woman is murdered by a family member for the perceived or alleged violation of notions of family honor. The government has to date failed to abolish laws allowing for the lenient treatment of honor crimes. Nor has it taken any steps to punish appropriately those who commit them. This inaction contributes to a climate of impunity for this form of violence against women.  Although the Jordanian government does attempt to protect women threatened by their families on the basis of honor, it attempts to do so by locking up the women in corrections facilities. In effect, a female victim is imprisoned while her attacker goes free. Official statistics indicate that every year, fifty to sixty women threatened by their families on the basis of honor are placed in administrative detention for periods ranging from a few months to more than three years. In addition, corrections officials treat such detainees as minors and refuse to allow them to leave the facility at their own discretion. In March 1999, the Jordanian criminal court sentenced Fayez Mohammed to nine months in prison. Mr. Mohammed had arranged the release of his seventeen-year-old daughter Lamis from the detention center where she was staying for her protection. Once she was released into his custody, he slit her throat. Human Rights Watch called on the Jordanian Prime Minister to work with the legislature and relevant government ministries to end its tolerance of honor killings by eliminating the articles of the Jordanian Penal Code which exempt or reduce the punishment of those convicted of honor crimes, as well as requiring police officers to conduct serious investigations pertaining to such crimes.","Middle East/North Africa, Jordan","Women's Rights"

""""Unlike many cases of police abuse that are settled out of court, there is a detailed public record of egregious police conduct in the Adams case,"""" said Julia Hall, counsel in the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Despite the court's finding that RUC officers inflicted severe injuries on David Adams -- and lied about it under oath -- these officers will now enjoy impunity for what amounts to torture."""" The letter urges the DPP to make public the criminal investigation report submitted by Assistant Chief Constable of Strathclyde, James Orr, under the supervision of the Independent Commission on Police Complaints, and the opinion of a senior counsel solicited by the DPP, which reportedly supports the decision not to prosecute. For more information, please contact: Julia Hall (716) 803 1127 Alex Frangos (212) 216 1844 The text of the letter is below: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- August 10, 1999 Alisdair Fraser Director of Public Prosecutions Royal Courts of Justice Chichester Street Belfast BT1 3NX Northern Ireland By fax: 011.44.1232.546146 Dear Mr. Fraser: Human Rights Watch is writing to express grave concern about your recent decision not to order prosecutions of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers accused of assaulting David Adams during his arrest and in Castlereagh Holding Centre in February 1994. Given the February 1998 civil case judgment against the RUC, which unequivocally found in favor of Mr. Adams and stated that the medical evidence incontrovertibly supported his claims of assault, we call on you to state publicly your justification for declining to prosecute the accused officers. We also urge you to release publicly the reports that we assume you used as the basis for your decision, namely the report of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC) criminal investigation supervised by Assistant Chief Constable of Strathclyde James Orr and the opinion you solicited from an independent senior counsel that reportedly supports your decision not to prosecute.  As you are well aware, David Adams was awarded the highest payment of exemplary damages ever ordered against the RUC. The injuries he suffered in the aftermath of his arrest included a punctured lung, broken ribs, and a broken leg—which Adams claimed he suffered after the officers took running, martial arts-style kicks at him in Castlereagh. The accused police officers either claimed that they did not inflict these injuries on Adams or that any physical contact with him was due to the fact that he """"struggled"""" with the officers. The judgment in the civil court action, however, rendered by Mr. Justice Kerr, stated that """"not only are the injuries consistent with the plaintiff's [Mr. Adams'] account but they cannot be explained if the police account is accepted."""" Mr. Justice Kerr went on to conclude that he had """"substantial reservations about the truth and accuracy of the evidence of police officers at the scene"""" and that """"the plaintiff was assaulted in Castlereagh in the manner alleged by him."""" On the strength of evidence submitted by a couple at the scene of the arrest, which recounted that the accused police officers called Adams """"a Fenian bastard"""" and one officer shouted, """"I hope he chokes on his own blood,"""" Mr. Justice Kerr also concluded that Adams """"was subjected to sectarian abuse."""" Indeed, the court ruled that """"all of the principal injuries suffered by the plaintiff were the result of assaults by police officers and that these were not occasioned or contributed to by resistance on his part."""" The court awarded Adams £30,000 in damages. The Adams case is unique because the civil action was not settled out of court. Thus, there is a complete record of testimony and evidence publicly available that details the assault upon Adams. Moreover, there is an unequivocal judgment finding the presentation of evidence by the accused RUC officers """"untruthful"""" and the RUC liable for Adams' injuries. Such public findings have been virtually unheard of in the past as the RUC has routinely claimed exemption from court proceedings—and having its officers testify in court—by requesting a Public Interest Immunity Certificate (PIIC). The issuance of PIICs has denied the public a full accounting of alleged police abuse in hundreds of cases. In the Adams case, however, no such immunity for police officers in """"the public interest"""" was claimed. Thus, it is all the more extraordinary that, despite the civil judgment meticulously detailing the abuse Adams suffered and finding that RUC officers perjured themselves before the court, no prosecutions have been ordered. It is of grave concern that the RUC officers have won effective immunity from prosecution for conduct amounting to torture and that they remain on active duty in the RUC in positions in which they may have other detainees in their care. In the aftermath of the civil judgment, RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan drafted Assistant Chief Constable of Strathclyde James Orr to conduct an independent criminal investigation into Adams' case under the direction of the ICPC. Constable Orr submitted his report to the DPP but that report has not been made public. We urge the DPP to make the ICPC report public in order to allay credible public fear that the DPP decision was taken despite a criminal investigation report containing evidence possibly bolstering the case for criminal prosecutions. After the decision not to prosecute the officers was made, the DPP's office claimed that it solicited an opinion by a senior counsel that eventually supported the DPP's decision. We also urge the DPP to make this opinion available to the public. Given the unusual public nature of this case and the record of abuse it details, we call on the DPP to offer a public explanation for what appears to be a politically influenced decision not to prosecute the accused officers. Silence on the part of the DPP will only serve to further undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system.

The international monitoring group pointed to tribunals to judge the perpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, as well as the decision last year by 120 countries to establish a permanent International Criminal Court to examine future cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. """"We are seeing a new international resolve to deal with war criminals,"""" said Kenneth Roth, the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"As Slobodan Milosevic has recently learned, its not as easy to get away with war crimes as it used to be."""" At the same time, the New York-based group called on the world community to step up efforts to bring other major war criminals to justice. """"In Sierra Leone, rebels who systematically hacked off the limbs of civilians are now being given amnesty,"""" said Roth. """"In the Congo, a cycle of impunity has encouraged all sides to continue committing war crimes."""" The four Geneva Conventions of 1949, and their protocols, set forth the """"laws of war,"""" the international humanitarian law that governs the conduct of parties to international conflicts as well as civil wars . They seek to protect persons who are not or are no longer taking part in the hostilities, and to restrict the means of warfare employed. The Geneva Conventions are among the most widely ratified treaties in the world, with 188 states parties. The conventions establish important protections for prisoners of war and those wounded on the battlefield. They also prohibit violence and inhumane treatment against civilians and bar the use of deportation and starvation against residents of occupied territories. In 1977, additional protocols to the Conventions updated the treaties for an era of air war with prohibitions on indiscriminate attacks and attacks with a disproportionate impact on civilians. Human Rights Watch recently cited these prohibitions in protesting NATO's targeting of civilian objects during the Yugoslavia war and in questioning whether, even when attacking legitimate military targets, NATO was taking all feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians.  Human Rights Watch has played a leading role in incorporating the Geneva Conventions into human rights monitoring. The traditional human rights law principle of the """"right to life"""" is difficult to apply a wartime context in which some killing is deemed legitimate. International humanitarian law, however, provides detailed rules to assess the proper conduct in warfare of both governments and armed opposition groups. In the past year, Human Rights Watch has reported on abuses in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Afghanistan, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Israeli-controlled South Lebanon. Human Rights Watch also called for the speedy ratification by 60 states which would allow the International Criminal Court to begin operations. To date, 83 countries have signed the court's treaty and four have ratified it. The United States has objected to the treaty, however, and vowed not to support it unless changes are made which would allow it to block any prosecutions of Americans accused of war crimes.","Global","International Justice"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/08/09/sanctioning-brutality-colombia","Sanctioning brutality in Colombia"," Sanctioning brutality in Colombia","","08/09/1999","Colombia's military and its Washington admirers claim that the most abusive army in the hemisphere has turned over a new leaf. Soldiers, they say, have purged human rights violators within their ranks and are pursuing the paramilitaries that have converted much of the country into a killing ground. A billion dollars rides on the point. A jittery Clinton administration fears Colombia's elected leaders are fumbling a bid for peace. Meanwhile, cocaine pours out of territory ceded to Marxist guerrillas more intent on seizing power than negotiating. Only massive military aid, the argument goes, will save Colombia from falling to """"narco-guerrillas"""" - a term coined by a U.S. ambassador in the 1980s. On the table is training assistance for several thousand troops and at least $1 billion in security assistance. With the death recently of five American soldiers, the costs are clearly more than financial. Colombia is a mess, it's true. But will pumping money into its army now bring peace? Not until the army breaks long-standing ties to the civilian shock troops known as paramilitaries. For decades, Colombia's security forces, particularly the army, have used these paramilitaries to fight the hemisphere's dirtiest war. Their methods are simple and brutal. When I interviewed Colombia's most notorious paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano, three years ago, he was unapologetic about murdering teachers, town council members, farmers, children, bus drivers, market vendors, and even a priest. """"Most of the people who fall are guerrillas or their base of support,"""" he assured me. """"When we take one out, we know we are saving many more who would have been killed in the future."""" Mr. Castano's forces are believed responsible for half of the 196 massacres registered by authorities in 1998. Most victims were civilians, not combatants, killed in cold blood and often mutilated. Repeatedly, observers - government investigators, human rights groups, church officials, even police - report that paramilitaries acted with the tolerance and on some occasions open support of the army. Colombian Gen. Fernando Tapias says that his forces no longer work with paramilitaries and punish officers who engage in atrocities. But there is sparse evidence to support his claim. Only after sustained international pressure did President Andres Pastrana on April 9 finally cashier Gens. Rito Alejo del Rio and Fernando Millan, each facing trial for alleged support for paramilitary atrocities. This long-awaited action was bitterly opposed by army commander Gen. Jorge Mora and has yet to lead to a broader purge. Gen. Mora continues to shield officers who violate human rights, such as Gen. Jaime Uscategui. For five days in 1997, Gen. Uscategui ignored pleas from a judge in Mapiripan as Mr. Castano's men shot and hacked their way through 30 people. According to prosecutors, soldiers under Gen. Uscategui's direct command had actually helped the paramilitaries unload their weapons at the air base where the United States kept most of its drug-fighting airplanes. Instead of clapping Gen. Uscategui in irons, the army is maneuvering to keep his case before a military tribunal, whose notorious tolerance of human rights abuses has demonstrated beyond doubt its inability to render justice. To be sure, dozens of low-ranking soldiers accused of murder and torture have been handed over to civilian courts for trial. Meanwhile, their superiors, who order, plan, and facilitate atrocities, face, at most, a rap on the knuckles. Several, like Gen. Uscategui, have even been rewarded with promotions. According to the Colombian military's own statistics, no high-ranking officer has ever faced trial in a civilian court for a human rights violation. The recent reform of the military penal code failed to address the problem, including the ability of officers to elude responsibility by arguing that they were simply following orders. Meanwhile, paramilitaries commit massacre after massacre under the nose of an accommodating army. Certainly, Mr. Pastrana needs the support of the international community to wrest peace from the hounds of war at his country's heels. A modern, law-abiding military must be a part of that peace. But it is much too early for the United States to climb into bed with a force that continues to violate human rights - or which tolerates those who do. No aid should be sent to units and officers that engage in or support such tactics. And before a penny of the proposed """"emergency"""" package of $1 billion is considered, the United States must demand clear, measurable progress against the paramilitaries, including the arrest of key leaders, a purge of tarnished officers - and the adoption of clear mechanisms to investigate and punish human rights abuses. There must also be a credible plan to combat paramilitary forces in the field. Without these guarantees, the United States risks complicity in atrocities, covering its eyes and ears to the pleas of Colombia's civilians.","Americas, United States, Colombia","Torture"

As they attempted to escape, the police chased victims into Thamiraparani river where they subequently drowned. In a letter sent today to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Human Rights Watch said the state government should:  Take immediate steps to investigate and punish those responsible for the attack and provide full compensation to the victims' families. Seek an immediate and fair resolution to the labor dispute that ensures workers their basic rights under national and international law. Appoint an independent judicial body to investigate the role of the police and administration in recurring large-scale attacks on Dalit community members. Enlist the assistance of the National Human Rights Commission in reviewing its procedures for deploying members of the reserve police during protests and in the aftermath of caste clashes. The full text of the letter follows.  August 6, 1999 Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi Chennai, Tamil Nadu India Dear Chief Minister Karunanidhi, We write to express our deep concern about the brutal police action against Dalit plantation workers in Tirunelveli district on July 23 that resulted in the loss of seventeen lives. The victims, including two women and one child, were among those protesting labor conditions. Members of the police and reserve forces began charging them with their lathis and pelting them with bricks and stones. As they attempted to escape, the victims were followed by the police into Thamiraparani river and subsequently drowned. Several protestors, including political leaders, also suffered severe head injuries. Human Rights Watch urges the government to take immediate steps to investigate and punish those responsible for the attack and provide full compensation to the victims' families. We also call on the government to seek an immediate and fair resolution to the labor dispute that ensures workers their basic rights under national and international law. Furthermore, with the help of India's National Human Rights Commission, the government should review its procedures for deploying members of the reserve police during protests and in the aftermath of caste clashes. The attack is the latest in a string of police attacks on Dalit protestors and villagers in the past several years.  According to activists in the region, the majority Dalit plantation workers of Manjolai Estate work in deplorable conditions, with no benefits, for less than the legal wage. Any attempt to legally and peacefully demand their rights has been met with the arbitrary arrest of protestors and brutal attacks on union leaders. As you are aware, the protestors had marched to the collectorate to demand an early resolution of wage-related disputes, as well as the release of 652 estate workers who were imprisoned following a prior demonstration before the collectorate on June 8. According to press reports and eyewitness accounts, the march was entirely peaceful and the police attack, which lasted thirty-five minutes, was unprovoked. Several members of the media, and those attempting to rescue the protestors, were also attacked and severely injured. Among those killed were a two-year-old child and his mother who was demanding the release of her husband. Human Rights Watch's own investigations have revealed a pattern of police brutality against Dalits during protests and during police raids on Dalit villages in the aftermath of caste clashes in Tamil Nadu's southern districts. The deployment of hundreds of members of the Swift Action Force, the Tamil Nadu Special Police, the Striking Force and the Armed Reserve Police during such attacks has also been documented. The attacks have often resulted in large-scale destruction of property, severe injuries, and the loss of many lives. In addition to the one-man commission of inquiry appointed to investigate the Tirunelveli incident, a separate and independent judicial body should be appointed to investigate the role of the police and administration in recurring large-scale attacks on Dalit community members. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to learning more about what your government has done to prosecute those responsible for the attack and to prevent its future occurrence.

The precise number of detainees is unknown since the Serbian government has failed to provide accurate figures to lawyers or human rights groups. According to a list compiled by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), based on information from the Serbian Ministry of Justice, approximately 2,000 ethnic Albanians are in Serbian prisons, including people who were arrested on charges of anti-state activities before the NATO campaign. The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, a Kosovo-based human rights group, indirectly obtained a list from the Serbian Ministry of Justice with approximately 2,000 names, although some of these detainees are not on the ICRC list. The Society for Political Prisoners in Pristina reports that many families know of relatives in Serbian prisons who are not on either list. The Humanitarian Law Center, with offices in Belgrade and three cities in Kosovo, has thus far confirmed that twenty persons previously considered missing are in Serbian prisons, but they are also not on the lists.  Complicating matters is the high number of people taken into custody by Serbian forces during the NATO bombing whose whereabouts are currently unknown. In the city of Djakovica (Gjakova in Albanian) alone, 1,041 people are reported missing as of August 1, 1999, many of whom are known to have been arrested between March and June 1999. Given the frequency of extrajudicial executions throughout Kosovo and the large number of unexamined graves throughout the province, there are very strong reasons to fear that some or all of the missing are dead. The joint appeal called on the Serbian government to immediately inform family members of detainees and missing persons believed to be in custody of the locations of detainees and the reasons for their detention. According to international law, all criminal charges must be made public and the accused must be provided with unrestricted access to a lawyer and family visits. Trials must be in full accordance with international standards.  The international community active in Kosovo should press the Serbian government at all opportunities for information on detainees and missing persons, and demand their fair treatment. The status of detainees was not addressed in the Kumanovo Agreement between NATO and the Yugoslav government or in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244/99, which mandated the international presence in Kosovo. Only concerted international pressure will help ensure these people's safety, the organizations said.

""""There is an overwhelming lack of public confidence in the criminal justice system in Azerbaijan,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Citizens are being preyed upon by corrupt and abusive police. At the same time, they have nowhere to turn for redress."""" The 57-page report, Azerbaijan: Impunity for Torture, describes how the Ministry of Internal Affairs often keeps detainees in a state of isolation from the outside world, including from lawyers and relatives, allowing torture to take place in virtual secrecy. Before their trial, detainees do not have even minimal access to the courts to review the grounds of their detention or complain about their treatment. Corruption is rampant. In one case, a Baku resident told researchers that his son was beaten to death in police custody before he was able to sell his family's household possessions to raise the full amount of a bribe requested by police for his son's release.  In more than twenty cases investigated by Human Rights Watch, no judge ruled inadmissible confessions or testimony reported to have been gained through torture. Since torture frequently occurs under conditions which only the torturers and the victim witness, a key piece of evidence to substantiate a claim of torture later in court is a prompt and impartial medical exam. But, as the report notes, Azerbaijani law leaves it entirely to the discretion of the police or procuracy to approve a detainee's request for the medical examination. In some of the cases examined, judges refused requests for medical exams once a case was sent to trial. In other instances when judges did agree to the exam, too much time had passed after a lengthy period of detention to allow a doctor to establish the cause of injuries.  Azerbaijani law gives the procuracy broad and vague powers to extend the length of detentions indefinitely without consulting a judge. This allows signs of torture such as bruises, broken bones, and burns to heal and fade while detainees are warehoused with little contact with the outside world in overcrowded pre-trial prisons known as """"investigative isolators."""" The report found that torture and physical abuse of detainees is widespread and systematic for both those detained under suspicion of committing political offenses and those suspected of non-political crimes.  """"Poor human rights conditions and high levels of corruption show the government's general disrespect for the rule of law and the international commitments it has made,"""" said Cartner. """"This disrespect doesn't bode well for foreign investment in Azerbaijan. Sustained economic development cannot take place in an environment where the government shows such disregard for human rights, transparency, and the rule of law."""" Cartner noted that many U.S. and European policy makers want to increase economic assistance to Azerbaijan and to companies to offset the costs of oil and gas pipeline projects to bring energy reserves to Western markets. She warned that the level of corruption and abuse in the Azerbaijani system should be a cause of concern to any investor or policy maker who intends to make a long-term commitment to the country. Cartner said that reform of the legal system needed to proceed in a transparent manner to ensure that new legislation conforms with international standards and that lawyers, nongovernmental advocates for detainee rights, and the public are included in the debates about draft legislation. In its recommendations, Human Rights Watch called on the World Bank to expand its capacity to review judicial systems and criminal procedures to enable the institution to identify areas that are not in compliance with international human rights law and standards, and to assist in the formulation of lending targets in these areas. Human Rights Watch believes that the World Bank — along with other multilateral and bilateral lending institutions—should set targets for legal reforms in these areas and promptly discontinue lending if targets are not met.

My name is Bronwen Manby and I am a researcher working on Nigeria in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch has monitored the situation in Nigeria for several years, and has issued numerous publications about human rights violations in that country, most recently focusing on the situation in the oil producing regions of the Niger Delta.   The situation in Nigeria has substantially improved over the last year. Following the death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June 1998, the unprecedented repression he visited on the Nigerian people was relaxed during the interim government of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. The inauguration of President Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29, 1999, brings some hope that the long series of military governments in Nigeria may be over.   While acknowledging the improvements that have taken place, Human Rights Watch would like to highlight our ongoing concerns, and raise issues for U.S. policy towards Nigeria in connection with those concerns. These include defects in the electoral process and the lack of a democratically drafted constitution, as well as the need for restoration of the rule of law and support for the process of investigating past violations. I will also address briefly the question of the resumption of U.S. military assistance to Nigeria. Finally, I will focus in more depth on the situation in the Niger Delta, which has the potential to derail the entire experiment in democracy now going forward.  Defects in the Electoral Process  When he took office, General Abubakar canceled the """"transition program"""" established by General Abacha, released political prisoners, and instituted a fresh transition program under conditions of greater openness. Local, state, and national elections were held in December 1998 and January and February 1999, which led to the inauguration of a civilian government, headed by former military head of state President Olusegun Obasanjo. Although most international and domestic observers of the elections welcomed their peaceful completion as an important step forward in the return of Nigeria to civilian government, they also noted serious flaws in the process at all stages. These irregularities included vastly inflated figures for voter turnout, stuffing of ballot boxes, intimidation and bribery of both electoral officials and voters, and alteration of results at collation centers. The irregularities were widespread, but were particularly serious in the South-South zone of the country, the Niger Delta region. In addition, the party primaries, including the presidential primary of the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) which led to the selection of Obasanjo as the presidential candidate, were marked by blatant purchasing of votes. At local and state level, candidates selected by party members from the district were frequently replaced at the instance of party leaders, without following proper procedures.   Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. government to work with state institutions and nongovernmental organizations in order to strengthen the links between the current government structures and their constituents and to ensure that the next elections held in Nigeria do represent a more genuine process. We also urge a review of the manner in which election monitoring is carried by U.S.-funded groups: it is important that election monitoring missions do not simply legitimize illegitimate processes.  The Lack of a Democratically Drafted Constitution  The constitution that came into force in Nigeria on May 29 was promulgated by General Abubakar only three weeks before the new government was inaugurated, following an unrepresentative drafting process that took place virtually without consultation with the Nigerian people. The 1999 constitution was finalized by a panel appointed by General Abubakar and adopted by the military Provisional Ruling Council. There is a consensus among Nigerian civil society organizations that the process by which the constitution was adopted was illegitimate and that the arrangements in relation to a number of crucial areas, including human rights and the rule of law, the structure of the Nigerian federation and the system for revenue allocation and resource management, are not acceptable. The Nigerian government should treat the current constitution as an interim document and should institute an immediate, inclusive, and transparent process for drafting a new constitution which will be legitimate in the eyes of all Nigerians.   The constitution's content also raises human rights concerns. For example, section 315(5) of the constitution provides that """"Nothing in the constitution shall invalidate"""" a set of laws, including the controversial National Security Agencies Act and Land Use Act, which in addition can only be repealed or amended by a special majority of the National Assembly and Senate. Section 6 of the National Security Agencies Act provides that the president may make any law to confer powers on the Defence Intelligence Agency, the National Intelligence Agency and the State Security Services. The Land Use Act provides the government with an extraordinary and often arbitrary degree of control over land; its repeal is one of the central demands of groups protesting oil production in the Niger Delta area. As a result of section 315(5) of the constitution, these laws cannot be challenged in any court of law as being unconstitutional. The provisions relating to independence of the judiciary are also not satisfactory, while the constitution fails to provide for the national Human Rights Commission established under General Abacha, which has, against all the odds, been able to carry out some useful work, and should be strengthened.  Restoration of the Rule of Law  Repeal of Military Decrees and Reform of the Justice System   Immediately before the handover of power to President Obasanjo, General Abubakar announced the repeal of a number of military decrees that had permitted a wide range of acts in violation of international human rights law. While a most welcome step, the many years of military rule in Nigeria have built up a large body of other laws that reflect their military origins and infringe on the rights of the Nigerian people. The U.S. should urge the Nigerian government to institute a comprehensive process of review of the laws in force, in conjunction with the national Human Rights Commission and the nongovernmental human rights community, with a view to the repeal or amendment of those that do not comply with the international human rights standards to which Nigeria is committed. Among the laws that should be examined are the Public Order Act and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Decree.   The new civilian government has also made commitments to respect the rule of law. The minister of justice has announced that the government intends to respect court orders issued against it; a major step forward, if the commitment is real. The new government has also stated that it is committed to improving prison conditions, building on the improvements gained by the release of several thousand prisoners from overcrowded jails over the last year, many of them held for years without trial. A number of states have disbanded the notoriously abusive paramilitary anti-crime units established under the military government, replacing them with units that do not include soldiers. These include Operation Sweep in Lagos State, replaced by a new Rapid Response Squad, and Operation Flush in Rivers State, replaced by a Swift Operations Squad. The methods used by the new units seem, however, to resemble those of their predecessors. On June 25, 1999, for example, Adewale Adeoye, chairman of Journalists for Democratic Rights, was arrested by members of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad, beaten, and detained overnight. He was held together with sixteen other people apparently arbitrarily selected for the purpose of extracting the bribes that they paid to be released.   Although the reforms announced are welcome, they are only the very first steps that are needed. There is an urgent need for the government to focus on issues relating to the administration of justice, in conjunction with the national Human Rights Commission and the human rights community in Nigeria as well as international agencies which can give technical assistance, in order to help restore respect for human rights and the rule of law - respect that is essential not only for the rights of the Nigerian people, but also to promote the sort of external investment that will be necessary to bring Nigeria out of its current economic crisis.   Investigation of Past Human Rights Violations   Immediately after he became head of state, President Obasanjo announced the appointment of a seven-member panel chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, to investigate """"mysterious deaths"""" and assassinations and other human rights abuses under the military governments in office since 1984 and to make recommendations to redress past injustices and to prevent future violations. The panel was widely welcomed by human rights groups in Nigeria, though it is not yet clear exactly what mandate, powers, or budget it will have, or the date by which it will have to complete its investigation and present a report.   Human Rights Watch also welcomes the appointment of this panel and believes that it has the potential to play an important role in the establishment of a truly new beginning in Nigeria - in the same way that the truth commissions in South Africa or Latin American countries have done. However, this potential will only be fulfilled if the panel is given sufficient powers, political backing and funding to enable it to carry out an effective investigation, sub poena witnesses, and make recommendations, including for prosecutions where appropriate. The U.S. government should support this process, and emphasize the importance for the investigation to be a thorough one to ensure that the cycle of impunity for human rights violations that has been the rule in Nigeria is broken.  Resumption of U.S. Military Assistance to Nigeria  With the inauguration of a civilian government, U.S. sanctions against Nigeria have been lifted, allowing for the resumption of military assistance to Nigeria, including under the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. Human Rights Watch is concerned that any military assistance given to Nigeria should include strict human rights conditions. In particular, we believe that resumption of military assistance must be in the context of a well-thought out strategy for increasing the democratic accountability of the Nigerian military, while emphasizing that any future attempt by the military to seize power will be met with tough sanctions.   The U.S. government should enforce Section 570 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, the so-called Leahy amendment, in relation to Nigeria, and should monitor military units that receive U.S. military aid. The Leahy amendment prohibits funds from being provided to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the secretary of state has credible evidence that the unit has committed gross violations of human rights, unless the secretary determines and reports to the congressional committees on appropriations that the government involved is taking effective measures to bring the responsible members of the security forces unit to justice. In this context, support for the panel chaired by Justice Oputa, and for prosecutions of military officials and others based on information received by the panel, could be of particular importance.   Strict control must be exercised over any military materiel supplied to the Nigerian government, for example for use by the Nigerian component of the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone, to ensure that it is cannot be transferred for use in other contexts where human rights violations are likely, for example in the Niger Delta. The U.S. government should take steps to screen any Nigerian army officers selected to benefit from U.S. training to ensure that those who have been responsible for human rights violations in the past are not included.  The Situation in the Niger Delta  The crisis in the oil producing regions is one of the most pressing issues for the new government of Nigeria and has the greatest potential to lead to a serious deterioration in respect for human rights. The Niger Delta has for some years been the site of major confrontations between the people who live there and the Nigerian government's security forces, resulting in extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions, and draconian restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. These violations of civil and political rights, which reached a climax during the """"Ogoni crisis"""" of 1993 to 1996, have been committed principally in response to protests about the activities of the multinational companies that extract Nigeria's oil and the use made of the oil revenue by the Nigerian government.   Since the relaxation in repression following the death of General Abacha, and in the context of the greater competition within the political environment encouraged by the elections and the installation of a civilian government, there has been a surge in demands for the government to improve the position of the different groups living in the oil producing areas. In particular, youths from the Ijaw ethnic group, the fourth largest in Nigeria, adopted the Kaiama Declaration on December 11, 1998, which claimed ownership of all natural resources found in Ijaw territory. In addition there has been an increase in criminal acts such as kidnappings of oil company staff in hope of ransom payments, and violence among neighboring ethnic groups over matters such as the location of local government headquarters, crucial in the distribution of oil resources.   In response, large numbers of soldiers and paramilitary Mobile Police have been deployed across the delta. Although there is a clear need for law and order to be reestablished in those parts of the delta where the violence between neighboring ethnic groups has been worst, the security forces have both failed to protect civilians from violence in many cases, and have also themselves carried out serious and widespread violations of human rights. Security force action has often been indiscriminate, or targeted at those who have not committed any crime but have protested oil production in accordance with their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. During a military crackdown in late December 1998 and early January 1999 in response to largely peaceful protests in support of the Kaiama Declaration, dozens of young men were killed, most of them unarmed. Others were tortured and inhumanly treated; many more were arbitrarily detained.   In another incident in January 1999, two communities in Delta State were attacked by soldiers, using a helicopter and boats commandeered from a facility operated by Chevron, following an alleged confrontation that took place at a nearby Chevron drilling rig. More than fifty people may have died in these incidents. Chevron did not issue any public protest at the killings; nor has it stated that it will take any steps to avoid similar incidents in the future. As in this case, the oil companies operating in Nigeria often fail to acknowledge any responsibility when security force action is taken in nominal defense of their facilities, although they have in many respects contributed toward the discontent and conflict within and between communities that results in repressive government responses.   In May and early June 1999, violence flared up in and around Warri, Delta State, where there has been serious conflict since 1997 among the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo ethnic groups. Government has consistently failed to address the concerns of the different ethnic groups living in the area, and repeated inquiries into the violence have remained incomplete, or their results unpublished. As in the case of similar violence that regularly flares up between different ethnic or religious groups elsewhere in the country, there are also persistent allegations that senior figures in the military have favored one or other side in the conflict.   President Obasanjo visited the delta area in June 1999 and held discussions with local leaders. He has promised to bring greater development to the delta, and introduced to the National Assembly a bill to establish a Niger Delta Development Commission. Leaders of the ethnic groups based in the Niger Delta, however, have rejected the bill since it does not address their concerns surrounding revenue allocation and resource control.   The level of anger against the federal government and the oil companies among the residents of the oil producing communities means that further protest is likely, as are further incidents of hostage taking and other criminal acts. Yet any attempt to achieve a military solution to these problems will certainly result in widespread and serious violations of Nigeria's commitments to respect internationally recognized human rights. While it is certainly necessary to establish the rule of law in the delta, a quiet achieved by repressive means can only be temporary and will result in more violence in the longer term.   To avoid a human rights crisis and achieve a peaceful solution to the unrest plaguing the oil producing regions, the new government must allow the peoples of the Niger Delta to select their own representatives and to participate in decision-making concerning the future course of the region. During the recent elections, observers noted especially widespread electoral irregularities in Rivers, Bayelsa, and Delta States, those most troubled by recent protests. These problems make it all the more essential that attempts to address the grievances of the delta communities involve discussions with individuals who are freely chosen by the communities of the delta and with a mandate to represent their interests, rather than with individuals chosen by the government as representative. In addition, the government must take steps to reestablish respect for human rights and the rule of law, and to end continuing human rights violations resulting from the deployment of soldiers in the delta region. The appropriate response to acts of violence must be to arrest and prosecute those responsible, not to carry out indiscriminate reprisals against the entire population of the oil-producing regions. Those who peacefully protest the manner in which oil is currently produced have a right to make their voice heard.   The U.S. should urge the Nigerian government, among other steps, to appoint an independent judicial enquiry to investigate the human rights violations in the delta, including during the Ogoni crisis and over the 1998/99 New Year period, and to discipline or prosecute those responsible and compensate the victims. The government should take steps to replace soldiers carrying out policing duties in the Niger Delta area and elsewhere with regular police with training in public order policing and ensure that those police deployed have been vetted to exclude abusive officers. The government should institute an immediate, inclusive and transparent process of negotiation with freely chosen representatives of the peoples living in the Niger Delta to resolve the issues surrounding the production of oil.   The U.S.-based oil companies operating in Nigeria, especially Chevron, Mobil and Texaco which operate joint ventures with the Nigerian government, also share a responsibility to ensure that oil production does not continue at the cost of violations of the rights of those who live in the areas where oil is produced. Given the deteriorating security situation in the delta, it is all the more urgent for the companies to adopt systematic steps to ensure that the protection of company staff and property does not result in summary executions, arbitrary detentions, and other violations. Systematic monitoring and protest of human rights violations by the government, and steps to ensure that the companies themselves are not complicit in such human rights violations, are more important than ever. Human Rights Watch has developed detailed recommendations to oil companies in its recent reports The Price of Oil: Corporate Responsibility and Human Rights Violations in Nigeria's Oil Producing Communities (February 1999) and Crackdown in the Niger Delta (May 1999), of which copies have been supplied to the subcommittee.  Conclusion  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, Human Rights Watch believes that the developments in Nigeria over the last year offer a real hope that the country can take its rightful place as a leader of the African continent and that its citizens can enjoy the respect for human rights to which they are entitled. However, the new government faces huge obstacles in achieving this goal in the face of the pattern of widespread and systematic abuse that has inherited from its predecessors, especially considering the shaky electoral foundations on which it stands. In particular, we are deeply concerned that the government may be tempted to respond violently to the discontent in the Niger Delta, a response that would catastrophically reverse progress towards respect for human rights in Nigeria as a whole. The U.S. government can play an important role in supporting legal and practical reforms by the Nigerian government through technical assistance and diplomatic pressure, and by assisting civil society organizations working towards increased respect for human rights. U.S. military assistance to Nigeria should be carefully tailored to ensure that it cannot be used to benefit officers who have been responsible for human rights violations or in situations where human rights violations are likely. The U.S. should also make clear to the Nigerian government that any attempt to resolve the crisis in the delta in a way that does not respect the rights of those who live in the oil producing regions is unacceptable. Equally, the administration should insist to the U.S. oil companies working in Nigeria that they must play their part in ensuring that oil production does not continue only due to the threat or actual use of force against those who protest their activities.","Africa, United States, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

On July 30, Human Rights Watch made public a list of seventy-seven detained or missing persons, mostly students.  The July crackdown has also targeted non-violent political activists outside of the universities. Four members of the Iran Nation Party—Bahram Namazi, Khosro Seif, Farzin Mokhber, and Mehran Abdolbaghi -- were picked up from their homes on July 13. They and Rozbeh Farahanipour, a founder of the Marze Por Gohar Party, remain in detention without charge.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/08/02/harassment-and-violence-against-serbs-and-roma-kosovo","Harassment and Violence Against Serbs and Roma in Kosovo","Harassment and Violence Against Serbs and Roma in Kosovo","","08/02/1999","Human Rights Watch released a detailed report documenting how ethnic Serbs and Roma (Gypsies) face fear, uncertainty, and violence in Kosovo. The most serious atrocities documented include dozens of killings of Serbs since mid-June. On July 23, as this report went to press, fourteen ethnic Serb farmers were shot dead as they harvested hay near the village of Gracko, in central Kosovo. However, as the report shows, there have been numerous ethnically-motivated killings in post-conflict Kosovo. For example, Marica Stamenkovic, seventy-seven years old, and Panta Filipovic, sixty-three years old, were brutally murdered on June 21 in the town of Prizren, where they had lived for decades. Having decided to stay in Prizren while other Serbs fled the city, the two victims and their spouses became the target of KLA harassment. Within days of KFOR's entry into Kosovo, uniformed KLA members began appearing at their homes demanding money and arms. After repeated visits and harassment, both victims were found with their throats cut. Marica Stamenkovic had been nearly decapitated. The 18-page report, which is based on numerous interviews with victims, eyewitnesses, and local officials in over a dozen villages and towns, describes direct and systematic efforts to force Serbs and Roma to leave their homes, including through arson, looting and the destruction of their property. Men have been detained, questioned, and beaten, often very badly. While most have subsequently been released, some of those abducted remain missing and are presumed dead. The majority of the abuses have been committed by men dressed in KLA uniforms, although it remains unclear whether there is an organized KLA campaign against minorities.  Prominent among explanations for these abuses is the desire of some ethnic Albanians to take revenge for atrocities committed by Serb security forces prior to KFOR's entry into Kosovo. While the Serb minority is the most obvious target of this retaliatory animus, Roma, too, are at risk, as they are commonly perceived by ethnic Albanians as having been willing collaborators in Serb abuses. Another related motivation for the abuse is to drive members of these minority groups out of Kosovo. Indeed, numerous Serbs and Roma have told Human Rights Watch that they have been directly warned by ethnic Albanians, under threat of violence, to leave Kosovo and never return. The response of KFOR and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to abuses against minority populations has been belated and uneven. To a large extent, the frequency of abuses against Serbs and Roma directly reflects the lack of a police force and the concomitant lack of law and order in Kosovo. In the absence of a fully deployed international police force, KFOR contingents have attempted to fill the security gap with military police operating police stations in major towns. Some contingents have stepped up patrols and deployed peacekeepers to protect populations at risk. Yet concerns about the safety of KFOR's own troops, a lack of experience in law enforcement functions and, above all, a shortage of available personnel, have frequently rendered KFOR units unable and unwilling to take the initiatives necessary to build confidence among Serb and Roma communities. Human Rights Watch called for immediate corrective action to prevent further abuses, including, most notably, the deployment of an effective international police force. The international monitoring group urged KFOR to increase the frequency of patrols in areas with at-risk populations and, as a matter of urgency, called on UNHCR to deploy additional protection officers and on the OSCE to station an adequate number of human rights monitors in areas with at-risk minority populations. The organization also called on donor institutions and governments to give priority in the allocation of reconstruction aid to those municipalities that protect and prevent violence and discrimination against ethnic minorities and persons due to their political affiliation, as well as to withhold from organizations and institutions located in Kosovo any reconstruction assistance, with the exception of emergency humanitarian aid, which cannot be adequately and meticulously tracked to ensure that those implicated in war crimes and/or serious human rights abuses do not benefit politically or economically.

The international monitoring organization urged the Sri Lankan government and LTTE to reach an immediate agreement which would guarantee safe passage of civilians and essential supplies, as well as free and unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief agencies operating in these vulnerable areas. """"Conditions for the civilians trapped in northern Sri Lanka, including hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons, have become critical,"""" said Jeannine Guthrie of Human Rights Watch. """"Civilians have been without adequate food, medical care and other humanitarian assistance for weeks, and the risk of acute malnutrition in children is growing."""" Humanitarian assistance to civilians in Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi Districts in the Vanni region of northern Sri Lanka has come to a near standstill since movement was banned across the forward defense lines with the closing of the Pappamoddai checkpoint on June 26, 1999. International humanitarian agencies operating in the area have reported that thousands of civilians have been trapped without access to assistance on both sides of the checkpoint; families have been separated; and no food rations have been delivered for five weeks since the supply lines closed. Aid agencies report that civilians are facing increasing difficulties obtaining any food — the availability of purchasable food is reportedly on the decline, and what is available for sale is becoming increasingly expensive and beyond the reach of most local families. The risk of serious health problems, particularly in children, is high.  Although some movement of international staff and patients was possible by Monday, for weeks humanitarian agencies were themselves trapped in the north of Sri Lanka and unable to transport supplies or their own personnel from the south to acutely vulnerable areas. The lives of patients requiring critical medical care have been endangered because transfers of patients had not been permitted since the closure. Human Rights Watch acknowledged the importance of the new transfers, but noted that less than ten of some one hundred patients in the Vanni currently awaiting transport to hospitals south of the checkpoint had been moved as of August 2. Human Rights Watch also welcomed the lifting of a physical blockade on the offices of international agencies in the Vanni by demonstrators demanding that the organizations pressure the Sri Lankan military to open a supply route. International staff were prevented from leaving their office premises for more than a week. """"These demonstrators may have believed they were serving the LTTE's interests by launching these protests. But they hampered essential relief work. We certainly hope the disruptions are not repeated."""" said Guthrie. The organization urged the LTTE to impress on the civilian population in its areas of control the critically important and nonpartisan role played by these agencies. Although government officials responsible for distribution of assistance to the displaced in the two districts have apparently been granted permission to purchase food rations locally, distribution has not commenced. Human Rights Watch stressed that in the long run humanitarian agencies must be given safe access to all civilians: """"The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE must guarantee free and unimpeded access to all people in need; a failure to do so is likely to lead to a humanitarian disaster.""""  A series of shorter checkpoint closures have disrupted the delivery of humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the Sri Lankan army's operation Rana Gosa in March 1999. This is the most serious and longest-running disruption to date and immediate action must be taken to ensure that food, medical aid and other assistance can reach the thousands of civilians currently trapped in northern Sri Lanka.","Asia, Sri Lanka",""

Witnesses say the demonstration was violently dispersed by police as human rights activists and members of the community were awaiting a stay order on the demolition from the Court of Appeal. Police reportedly sprayed mace and tear gas at some one hundred men, women and children who had formed a human barricade around the settlement, and then used water cannons and physical assault to disperse the crowd. More than fifty people were reportedly arrested, with the majority released soon after. Fernandez was released pending charges the same day, six others were held overnight. About twenty homes in the settlement were demolished. Besides voicing concern over the authorities' abuse of the protestors' rights to freedom of assembly and expression, Human Rights Watch called on the Malaysian government to conduct an independent investigation into charges of excessive use of police force against those involved in the protest. This is not the first time Irene Fernandez has been charged under draconian Malaysian laws which restrict freedom of expression. She is currently on trial in a separate case under the Printing Presses and Publications Act for """"malicious publication of false information"""" for a memorandum released in 1995 in which she alleged severe abuse of migrant workers in immigration detention facilities. Ms. Fernandez faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison if convicted. That trial is now reportedly the longest in Malaysian history.","Asia, Malaysia","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

More than 100,000 refugees still live in camps in Guinea which are dangerously close to the Sierra Leone border, where they have been killed, abducted, and mutilated in cross-border armed attacks, Human Rights Watch said. Donor countries have failed to contribute any of the U.S.$4 million appeal issued by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for relocating the camps. The parties to the conflict in Sierra Leone signed a peace treaty in Lome, Togo earlier this month, but the refugees are unlikely to return until their safety can be guaranteed, said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"Until they can safely go back to Sierra Leone, these refugees must have the full protections they deserve,"""" said Reilly. """"Tens of thousands of children are living in unacceptable conditions right now in the camps.""""  Human Rights Watch identified a clear link between the lack of food security for the refugees and many of the human rights abuses documented in the report. Girls as young as twelve testified that they have no choice but to prostitute themselves with up to three men a day in order to feed themselves and, in some cases, their families. """"Not only have these children suffered some of the worst atrocities ever recorded in the world during the war in Sierra Leone, but they remain at risk in the refugee camps in Guinea - where they are supposed to find safety,"""" said Reilly. """"The world has taken on the challenge to protect refugees in Europe. African children deserve no less.""""  Human Rights Watch also found that some refugee camps are being used as military bases for Sierra Leonean government combatants and refugee children are being used as soldiers in the Sierra Leonean conflict. These children require special attention for the trauma suffered during the war.

Sending this inmate to Red Onion was outrageous, a purely vindictive abuse of power,"""" said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. """"Unfortunately he is one of hundreds who should never have been sent to Red Onion. The department has consistently ignored its own rules as it tries to fill super-maximum security beds it never needed."""" The inmate, John Wood, sent a letter to Human Rights Watch describing his encounter with Mr. Angelone on March 17 during a Board of Corrections tour of Coffeewood Correctional Center where Mr. Wood was serving a two-year sentence for drug possession. Mr. Wood complained to Mr.Angelone about the placement of heat registers high on the walls because the heat rose, leaving the dormitories cold, and he challenged Mr. Angelone's response that cold air rises. A few minutes later, Mr. Angelone told the inmate to pack his bags because he was going to be sent to Red Onion, one of two super-maximum security prisons in Virginia.  Mr. Wood had no history of disciplinary infractions, violence or escape-related conduct during his incarceration. According to a story in today's Richmond Times-Dispatch, a department spokesman has confirmed that Mr. Angelone was upset by the inmate's """"mouthing off"""" in front of other inmates and Board members and saw it as a challenge to his authority.  Mr. Wood spent two weeks in segregation at Red Onion, confined to his cell 23 hours a day. He was then released to general population at Red Onion. On April 22, Mr. Wood received a reclassification score that would have placed him at the lowest security level in the DoC system—level 1. However, the DoC used a """"discretionary override"""" to raise his level to security level 3. Mr. Wood was then transferred from Red Onion to the Augusta Correctional Center.  """"Mr. Wood's case exemplifies the misuse of power that can occur when correctional authorities operate with insufficient commitment to sound correctional principles and inadequate public oversight and accountability,""""according to Ms. Fellner, author of the Human Rights Watch report, """"Red Onion State Prison: Super-Maximum Security Confinement in Virginia."""" That report and a follow-up briefing paper presented to the Virginia Crime Commission at its June 30 meeting documented the Department of Corrections' practice of arbitrarily sending men to Red Onion who could be safely confined in less restrictive facilities. The department was overriding the results of its own security scoring system to send men to Red Onion who had no records of serious institutional violence or disruption. It had also adopted, without justification, a policy of sending to Red Onion any inmate with a life sentence or who had committed murder, regardless of their conduct after incarceration.  At its June 30th meeting, members of the Crime Commission sharply questioned Mr. Angelone about the practice of assigning men who have low security scores to Red Onion. Instead of abandoning that practice, the department in July instituted a new scoring system that increases the points inmates receive for specified risk factors. It has not publicly explained the reasons for the higher scoring system.  """"We are concerned that the department has instituted the new higher scoring system simply to make it easier for inmates to accumulate the points needed for assignment to super-maximum security facilities,"""" said Ms. Fellner.

In a 56-page report released simultaneously in Jerusalem and Beirut, Human Rights Watch said that entire families have been expelled from the occupied zone in a summary and often cruel manner, without due process of law. The victims, who have included elderly men and women as well as children, have been forced to leave their homes and villages without any advance notice and were generally not permitted to bring any personal possessions with them. Human Rights Watch said that this practice has been in effect at least since 1985, and that the number of expulsions increased dramatically in 1998 and 1999. """"South Lebanon is not just a security zone, it's an occupied territory where innocent civilians also live,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, """"The abuse of those civilians has got to stop."""" Human Rights Watch said that hundreds, if not more, have been expelled since 1985, but the exact number is unknown because no one over the years, including the Lebanese government, has maintained comprehensive statistics. At least 46 Lebanese who were expelled in 1998 reported their cases to local offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The US State Department, in sharp contrast, reported that only 12 Lebanese were expelled in 1998 -- five women, four children, and three men. Most Lebanese have been expelled as punishment for suspected activities of their relatives. Those activities may include attacks on Israeli troops in the occupied zone, membership in Hizballah and other Lebanese groups that have military wings, and refusal to serve in the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's auxiliary militia in the zone. The expulsions are carried out in secrecy. Families are typically bundled into unmarked civilian cars and taken to a local SLA security office, where they are informed that they are being expelled. They are not permitted to return home and gather personal belongings, but are promptly transported to a crossing point at the edge of the occupied zone and deposited into the no man's land, where they must walk to the first Lebanese army checkpoint. Israel has always denied responsibility for the actions of the SLA, although it admits to funding, arming, and coordinating intelligence-gathering with the militia. But as the occupying power in its self-described """"security zone"""" in south Lebanon, Israel bears ultimate responsiblity for both its own actions and those of its proxy militia. Deportations and forcible transfers of civilian residents in occupied territory are categorically prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. and the member states of the European Union to publicly condemn the expulsions, and to press Israel to allow the expelled Lebanese civilians to return to their homes and recover their property under safe conditions, free of any form of coercion or initimidation from occupation security authorities. Roth said that Human Rights Watch had urged President Clinton and other senior administration officials to discuss the expulsions with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak during his July 15-20 visit to the US.  """"Ehud Barak says he wants to make peace with Israel's neighbors,"""" said Roth. """"But violating the rights of civilians in South Lebanon is not a very good way to make peace."""" Human Rights Watch also called upon the government of Lebanon to maintain complete and detailed files about expulsions of families and individuals from the occupied zone, and make such information available to the international community. ------- Khowlah Daleh, 64, and her husband, Ibrahim Hashem, 57, were expelled from the village of Sheba', in the northeastern section of the occupied zone, in May 1998. They returned home from a visit to Beirut and found a senior South Lebanon Army (SLA) security official waiting for them. He ordered them to report to a nearby SLA security office the next day, which they did. SLA security operatives questioned them for an hour about the activities of their adult children who lived in Beirut, and then put them in a car, drove them to the Zumrayya crossing point, and summarily expelled them from the occupied zone. Mr. Hasem told Human Rights Watch that his request to stop at their house and gather some clothing was refused.  The Hashem family lost their home and all its contents, as well as about U.S. $6,000 in annual income from their orchards of cherries, walnuts, and pomegrantes. """"We invested all of our money in our house and land,"""" Knowlah told Human Rights Watch. """"I cry myself to sleep every night since this happened."""" At 6:00 in the morning on September 17, 1996, soldiers of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) surrounded the home of the Abdullah family, in the village of Houla in Israeli-occupied south Lebanon. One soldier told the family that they had to report immediately to a nearby SLA post. Mr. Abdullah, 67, his wife Khadija, 57, and their two daughters were transported there in an unmarked civilian car. """"No one talked to us for two hours,"""" Khadija told Human Rights Watch. """"I thought they were sending us to prison."""" Finally, two SLA militiamen told the family that they were being expelled from the occupied zone. They denied Khadija's request to return to her house and gather some possessions. The family was placed in another unmarked car, driven to the Beit Yahoun crossing point, and expelled from the zone. Why were they targeted and punished? A week before the expulsion, Khadija's 19-year-old son Ali, who had been forcibly conscripted into the SLA earlier that year, had deserted the militia. This family of farmers lost their house and all its contents, as well as three cows, 60 chickens, and income from wheat, lentils, fava beans, vegetables, milk and eggs.

Kazem Shukri should be released immediately. No one should be imprisoned solely for exercising their right to free expression,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. Megally also called on Iran's leaders to end the ban of Salam, and described the effort as """"a blatant attempt to gag Iran's vibrant independent press.""""  The conviction of Hojatoleslam Musavi-Koeiniha, a member of the clergy and a proponent of political reform and freedom of the press, follows the July 7 order by the Special Court for the Clergy shutting down the Salam following the daily's publication of a government memorandum dealing with plans to suppress those publications favoring political reform. The memorandum named several members of the parliament as linked with the planned campaign against the press. Hojatoleslam Musavi-Koeiniha was convicted on July 25 by the same Special Court on charges of defaming a government official, publishing insulting language, and misinforming the public. The ban against Salam is indefinite and remains in force.  The Special Court's banning of Salam on July 7 helped to set in motion several days of large-scale student protests in Tehran and other major cities. The other contributing factor, also on July 7, was the first passage in the parliament, known as the Majlis, of draft legislation to increase the powers of the government-controlled Press Supervisory Board. This would change its composition to make it more conservative, authorize the prosecution of writers and journalists as well as publishers and editors, and authorize prosecutions in Revolutionary Courts for alleged offenses in print. Pending final passage of this legislation, government opponents of political reform have been using the Special Court for the Clergy to attack independent journalists and suppress reformist publications, many of which are run by reform-minded clergy. The Special Court for the Clergy reports directly to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Although much of the proceedings of the one-day trial before the normally secretive court were broadcast on national television, and Hojatoleslam Musavi-Koeiniha spoke in his own defense, the procedures of the court fell far short of international standards, in particular the right to be tried before an independent and impartial judicial body. In this case, among the jury of eight appointed by the judge were several prominent anti-reform officials, including Hojatoleslam Hoseinian, director-general of the Islamic Propagation Society. Hoseinian is known to be a close associate of Saeed Emami, the former Information Ministry official who authored the memorandum published by Salam and whom the government has identified as responsible for the assassinations of at least five independent writers and political personalities in late 1998.  Kazem Shukri, editor of the center feature pages of Sobh-e Emrouz, another reformist daily, has been detained since July 20 following publication of an article which, according to the Tehran public prosecutor, distorted and insulted Islam. He has not been granted a hearing before a judge or permitted the opportunity to post bail. The paper's managing editor, Saeed Hajjarian, was also summoned and questioned but released on bail. The Press Affairs department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance issued a statement on July 21 declaring that Shukri's detention and interrogation were """"unprecedented"""" and in violation of the country's press law. Independent Iranian journalists have told Human Rights Watch that Shukri is being pressured to implicate others in the publication of an article which the Tehran Public Prosecutor contends was offensive to Islam. The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), citing the legal office of the judiciary, reported on July 21 that writers as well as editors """"can also be prosecuted for the criminal content of their articles.""""  The independent print media have become increasingly central in Iranian political life, and are an important forum for debate about the future direction of the Islamic Republic. In the absence of legally recognized opposition political parties, independent newspapers play a vital role in presenting alternative viewpoints and promoting greater respect for basic human rights in the country. Iranian journalists have told Human Rights Watch that two other reformist dailies, Khordad and Neshat, will also face legal proceedings designed to silence them. The apparent aim of those behind the crackdown is to suppress the independent press as much as possible in advance of parliamentary elections scheduled for next February.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran",""

Human Rights Watch urged the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to locate and interview the police officer identified in the report as """"Lutka,"""" who may have valuable information about the identities of those who committed summary executions and other atrocities in the area. The twenty-five-page report describes summary executions, including a massacre of twenty-three children, arbitrary detentions, regular beatings, widespread looting, and the destruction of schools, hospitals, and other civilian objects during the Serbian government's three-month campaign of """"ethnic cleansing"""" from March - June 1999. As a stronghold of the KLA and an area of constant fighting with government forces, the Glogovac municipality was particularly hard-hit between March 19, when international observers (the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission) withdrew from Kosovo before the NATO bombing campaign, and June 15, when Serbian and Yugoslav forces withdrew from the region.  The most serious atrocities documented in the report took place in two villages near Glogovac: Staro Cikatovo and Stari Poklek, both places where the KLA was active. In Poklek, the police blocked a group of ethnic Albanians—mostly members of the extended Muqolli family— from fleeing their village and forced them into the house of a relative. After a few hours, the owner of the house, Sinan Muqolli, and another man were taken outside, executed and thrown into the family well.  Shortly thereafter, a grenade was thrown into the room holding at least forty-seven persons, including twenty-three children under the age of fifteen. One man in uniform raked the room with automatic gunfire, a survivor said, killing everyone inside except six people. A member of the Muqolli family is a local commander of the KLA. A Human Rights Watch researcher visited Sinan Muqolli's largely burnt house on June 25, 1999. The room where the killing took place had bullet marks along the walls and bullet casings from a large-caliber weapon scattered on the floor. The basement below the room had dried blood stains dripping from the ceiling and walls and a large pool of dried blood on the floor. Surviving family members displayed a cardboard box containing some of the bones allegedly collected from the room and showed the nearby well where they claimed some of the bodies had been dumped.  In Staro Cikatovo on April 17 the police attacked the village and separated the men from the women and children. By the end of the day, twenty-three men from the Morina family had been killed. Another four were still missing as of June 25 and presumed dead by their families. The survivors from Staro Cikatovo insist that none of the dead men were involved in the KLA, although several members of the family are KLA soldiers, including two who were wounded in the assault. As in Poklek, this may be one explanation for the executions. Human Rights Watch visited Staro Cikatovo on June 25, 1999. Between 40 and 50 percent of the approximately one hundred homes had been badly damaged or destroyed. Most houses had been burned from the inside, indicating that they were purposefully burned rather than damaged in combat. Several structures had also been demolished by bulldozers. The actions in the Glogovac municipality were clearly coordinated between the regular Serbian police, the Yugoslav Army, and paramilitaries, whom witnesses identified as having long hair and beards, with colored bandanas on their heads and sleeves. While the police were responsible for many of the beatings in Glogovac, as well as the organized mass expulsion, it is the paramilitaries who are implicated in most of the serious violence, such as in Poklek and Staro Cikatovo. The only person identifiable by witnesses was a deputy police chief from Glogovac known as """"Lutka,"""" a known policeman in the town. Residents said that he did not behave brutally, unlike many of the paramilitaries, although he was involved in thefts, and he was a principal organizer of the forced depopulation in early May, telling Albanians that they should """"get on the buses or go to Albania by foot."""" It should be noted that these abuses are hardly the first war crimes committed by Serbian or Yugoslav forces in the Glogovac municipality. Since February 1998, the Drenica region has been the sight of numerous executions, arbitrary detentions, beatings, and the systematic destruction of civilian objects, such as schools, medical clinics, and mosques. Human Rights Watch called on the international community to support the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) by guaranteeing ongoing financial and political support to the Tribunal, assisting the Tribunal to identify witnesses and evidence, and working closely with the Tribunal to secure evidence and ensure the protection of witnesses.  The organization also urged the international community to provide the Tribunal with any intelligence information obtained that relates to the commission of war crimes, including the identification of specific units engaged in operations in areas in which abuses occur, and to convey relevant satellite intelligence information to the Tribunal.","Europe/Central Asia, Albania, Serbia/Kosovo",""

It's in ASEAN's interest to address underlying problems of governance that remain unresolved, even if the immediate impact of the Asian economic crisis has let up,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The credibility of ASEAN depends on its ability to deal effectively with both political and economic problems. They can't be separated.""""  Human Rights Watch urged Japanese Foreign Minister Komura, U.S. Secretary of State Albright, and Australian Foreign Minister Downer to take the lead in coordinating an effort to get heads of state from all the ASEAN governments to convey directly to Indonesian President B.J. Habibie their concern about the violence in East Timor. Paramilitary groups backed by the Indonesian army have attacked U.N. staff and civilians in the weeks leading up to a planned U.N. vote in late August. Until the Indonesian government takes adequate steps to control the militias, donors should work to suspend disbursements on international loans to Jakarta. Burma became a member of ASEAN in 1997, but its human rights record has worsened in the past year with the roundup of democracy activists and widespread use of forced labor. A mission from the European Union visited Burma from July 6-8 to explore possibilities for """"dialogue"""" on human rights, and a representative of the U.N. Secretary General is due to visit in the coming weeks. Human Rights Watch called on ASEAN members to urge the Burmese government to fully cooperate with prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross which began in May, and to implement recommendations by the International Labor Organization for an immediate end to all use of forced labor and unhindered access by the ILO to monitor compliance. The ASEAN meetings also provide a useful opportunity to press the Cambodian government to enact legal and judicial reforms that would help restore donor and investor confidence. Many ASEAN and Western countries withdrew aid and investments after a violent coup in July 1997 and Cambodia's membership in ASEAN was delayed, but following elections last year Cambodia was admitted last April. The ASEAN dialogue partners should express deep concern about the continuing climate of impunity and urge the Cambodian government to initiate serious, independent investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for hundreds of killings and other abuses since 1993. They should also make it clear that any tribunal for Khmer Rouge leaders must take place under U.N. auspices and in full conformity with international standards.

Cuba's Repressive Machinery details how Cuba's laws deny basic rights such as freedom of expression, association, and movement, and describes the plight of dozens of individuals prosecuted under those laws. The 263-page report also details ill-treatment rising to the level of torture in Cuban prisons. Labor rights are routinely violated in Cuba's expanding foreign investment sector, the report shows, by laws obstructing union formation and requiring state control of hiring. """"Forty years after assuming power, the Castro government still prosecutes dissidents for peacefully expressing their views,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"Cuba stands alone in the hemisphere for this kind of human rights abuse: criminalizing free speech and association, imprisoning dissidents, and denying access to international human rights monitors."""" Vivanco noted that the trial of four prominent dissidents earlier this year showed that the Castro government was intent on quashing any vocal opposition. He noted that Cubans are tried for crimes such as """"enemy propaganda"""" and """"contempt for authority,"""" and that the government also use an ill-defined provision again """"dangerousness"""" to detain even Cubans who have not committed any crime. The Human Rights Watch report also criticizes the U.S. trade embargo, imposed in 1961 as part of Washington's efforts to overthrow Castro. """"Rather than a calibrated tool that can respond to changes in Cuban human rights practices,"""" Vivanco said, """"the embargo is an all-or-nothing policy."""" Under current law, the embargo cannot be lifted—in whole or in part—until a transition government, one that includes neither Fidel Castro or his brother Raul, is in place in Cuba.  The indiscriminate nature of the embargo has brought international condemnation, from the United Nations General Assembly, Pope Jean Paul II, and governments of every political stripe. """"The embargo has become counterproductive to the promotion of human rights,"""" Vivanco said. """"It has divided the international community and enabled Castro to justify repression on anti-imperialist grounds."""" Cuba's Repressive Machinery also shows how the embargo's travel limits themselves violate human rights. In addition to outlining how Cuban laws criminalize free expression and association, the report shows how a lack of independent judges and access to attorneys compromises the right to a fair trial. The government's failure to ensure due process rights makes Cuba's use of the death penalty especially troubling, according to the report, which notes recent executions by firing squad.  Although respect for religious rights in Cuba has grown in recent years, the report finds continuing restrictions on public expressions of faith, on prisoner'' access to pastoral care, and on the distribution of humanitarian aid by church groups. Cuba's Repressive Machinery offers detailed recommendations to the Cuban government, as well as to governments of the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as to international investors in Cuba.  Human Rights Watch urges the European Union and Canada to take a more active role in promoting human rights.

On Ottawa's position, Vivanco said, """"We are pleased that Canada has decided to reexamine its 'constructive engagement' policy with Cuba, which did not produce human rights improvements. We urge the Canadian government to redouble its efforts to win Cuban human rights gains.""""

We welcome this verdict, and hope this means that Cambodian nongovernmental organizations will no longer be subject to official harassment,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch."""" This case should never have gone to trial in the first place. And despite the positive outcome, the Cambodian court system still needs a lot of improvement."""" Jendrzejczyk noted that serious procedural errors and lack of evidence marked the trial from the outset, and that several of the defendants were tortured in police custody. Licadho employees Kim Sen and Meas Minear and market vender Khieu Piseth were charged with inciting illegal demonstrations and violence when riots broke out after residents learned that 3,000 tons of toxic waste had been dumped near the port city of Sihanoukville. Seven other defendants were charged with robbery. After three days in court (July 8-9 and July 21), Judge Tak Kimsea decided to drop the charges against the ten people. According to a Human Rights Watch observer present at the three-day trial, the prosecution was not able to introduce a single piece of evidence or a single witness to support the charges against Kim Sen and Meas Minear. In addition, a six-week investigation by Human Rights Watch in March and April 1999 showed that the case was marred by procedural flaws from the beginning, when the two rights workers were arrested without warrants, charged without sufficient evidence, and then imprisoned for a month. Human Rights Watch also noted that evidence was presented during the trial that three of the defendants had been tortured while in police custody. A fourth man, arrested but not charged, also testified that he was beaten in custody. Further evidence was given that at least two people arrested during the demonstrations were forced to sign statements in police custody. At no stage during the hearing did either the judge or prosecutor comment on, or seek any further details of, these alleged improprieties committed by the police. Jendrzejczyk noted that torture is prohibited by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture, andArticle 12 of the Cambodian Criminal Code. On the positive side, Human Rights Watch said it was generally satisfied that the judge permitted both the defendants and defense witnesses to have their say, and the defense lawyers were able to make a strong case.","Asia, Cambodia",""

An investigation conducted found that children are often held in the same cells as adults accused of serious crimes, and are often denied adequate food, medical care, education and access to basic sanitary facilities. Many children subjected to such conditions are not suspected of any crime, but are taken into custody because they have been abused, neglected or abandoned. The investigation was conducted by Human Rights Watch in cooperation with the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School. """"Even adult criminals should not be in jails like these,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"To keep children in such conditions is simply inexcusable.""""  Jamaican law prohibits any child from being held in police custody for more than twenty-four hours. Police officers are required immediately to place any child whom they detain in a facility run by the Children's Services Division. Only children suspected of extremely serious and violent offenses are supposed to be placed under maximum security.  """"Many of the abuses we've found can be addressed quite easily,"""" commented Becker. """"With better communication between the police and Children's Services, more appropriate placements for children can almost always be found.""""  Human Rights Watch found that lock-ups are invariably overcrowded, with cells frequently holding more than twice the number of detainees for which they were designed. One facility with a capacity of 50 held 138 prisoners, including numerous minors. A lack of beds forces prisoners to sleep on the floors, which are filthy, damp and often covered with urine. Because access to functional toilets is severely restricted, prisoners often have little choice but to urinate and defecate in the cells.  Children detained in cells with adults are often the prey of older prisoners, and some reported being beaten, raped and stabbed. Children are also subject to abuse by police. One fifteen year old girl reported being raped by a police officer while held in a lockup overnight, while others reported abusive language, severe beatings and mock executions.  Children may be detained for months, and in some cases, over a year. One thirteen-year old boy was held for eight months after being accused of stealing a radio. However, despite the long periods of detention, prisoners have no opportunity for physical exercise, and medical care is provided, if at all, only in the event of an emergency. During its investigation, Human Rights Watch interviewed several children who were visibly injured or ill, but had received no medical attention  In addition, most prisoners told Human Rights Watch that they relied on visits from family members to get enough food, as the food supplied in the lockups was limited and of poor quality. In some lockups, children reported going for several days with no food at all, or with only bread.  Children in police lockups in Jamaica have no access to education. Human Rights Watch also visited a children's home and places of safety designed specifically for children who are in need of care or who are accused of an offense. Conditions in such facilities were significantly better than police lockups, and included educational, vocational and extracurricular programs.  Human Rights Watch today urged the Jamaican government to actively monitor facilities to ensure that children are not improperly detained and to bring Jamaica's juvenile justice system into conformity with international standards for the treatment of children.  In 1994, Human Rights Watch published a report on children in Jamaican police lockups that also documented atrocious conditions. Although slight improvements were made in the wake of the earlier report, the organization reports that most were superficial.

There are currently 2.6 million civilians residing in areas under rebel control who are facing food shortages and a deteriorating health situation. """"It is clear that there is a humanitarian disaster in the countryside of Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But until the RUF grants aid agencies access, no one can provide any relief or know the true extent of the suffering."""" On May 18, the RUF signed a ceasefire agreement with the Sierra Leonean government in which they agreed to """"guarantee safe and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations to all people in need."""" Since then, aid agencies have been unable to obtain RUF clearance for delivery of food or medicines to civilians in rebel-held areas.  Civilians leaving RUF-controlled areas describe acute food shortages. Health workers are treating an increasing number of malnourished children and adults and have expressed concerns over increasing infant and child mortality rates, extreme shortage of medications, and country-wide outbreaks of measles and dysentery. In a July 20 letter to rebel leader Corporal Sankoh, Human Rights Watch urged him to honor this agreement. In the letter, Human Rights Watch notes that efforts by U.N. agencies and international groups to commence assessments and programs within areas under RUF control have on several occasions been frustrated by communications breakdowns, failed appointments and new operational requirements being placed by the RUF. Human Rights Watch urges the RUF to allow an assessment mission by U.N. and international organizations planned for July 22 to Makeni, one of the hardest-hit and most populated areas under rebel control, to take place, and for the delivery of humanitarian aid to commence shortly thereafter. The government of Sierra Leone and the RUF on July 7 signed a peace accord which calls for the disarmament and demobilization of combatants, and allows for power sharing by the rebels and a blanket amnesty for all atrocities committed during Sierra Leone's civil war.

Although the violence, between students and civilian groups linked to senior conservative clerics, ended four days ago, arrests have continued. """"The Iranian authorities should officially confirm the number of people arrested and make their names public,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"We are gravely concerned that the fate of hundreds remains unknown.""""  In a communiqu?issued Sunday July 18, student leaders from the Elected Council of Student Protesters, a coordinating body of Tehran students which has emerged after the clashes, estimated the number of detainees at 1,400. So far there has been no official statement on the number arrested. Human Rights Watch urged that those not involved in any criminal activities should be released immediately while others against whom there is evidence of criminal conduct should be given fair, public trials with full access to the procedural safeguards required in international law. The organization fears that many of the detainees are being held for exercising their right to nonviolent freedom of expression. Human Rights Watch said that in addition to arrests during the demonstrations, there were reports of student leaders and journalists being detained from their homes by security forces and paramilitaries working with them. Among those detained are three leaders of the opposition political party, the Iran Nation Party. Khosrow Seif, the seventy-year-old spokesperson for the INP, which has been banned but is still tolerated, as well as Behzad Namazi and Mehran Abdolbaghi, were detained from their homes on Wednesday July 14. The founders of the INP, Darioush and Parvaneh Forouhar, were murdered in their Tehran home by agents linked to the Ministry of Information in November 1998. Human Rights Watch also urged the Supreme National Security Council to make good on its pledge to carry out an independent and public inquiry into the assaults and killings of students which took place at Tehran University in the early hours of Friday July 9, 1999. Human Rights Watch said it remained deeply troubled by the involvement of violent semi-official civilian groups in suppressing nonviolent protest and threatening proponents of reform.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/16/rights-abuses-behind-kashmir-fighting","Rights Abuses Behind Kashmir Fighting","Rights Abuses Behind Kashmir Fighting","India, Pakistan both guilty, says new report","07/16/1999","In a new report published today, Human Rights Watch charges that human rights violations by all parties in Kashmir have been a critical factor behind the current conflict. The report says that if those violations had been seriously addressed at any time over the last ten years, the risk of a military confrontation between India and Pakistan might have been reduced. The escalation in fighting has made it urgent that the international community put pressure on India to end widespread human rights violations by its security forces in Kashmir, and on Pakistan to end its support for abusive militant groups. """"The diplomats have focused on getting India and Pakistan each to stay behind the so-called 'Line of Control. But repression and abuse on both sides are keeping this conflict alive. Unless there is pressure on both India and Pakistan to end the abuses, international diplomacy to defuse the conflict is bound to fail."""" The 44-page report, Behind the Conflict in Kashmir, focuses on the border areas in southern Kashmir where militant forces have been crossing over from Pakistan. The report documents several of the massacres of Hindu civilians carried out by these groups and their local counterparts, in which more than 300 civilians were killed between 1997 and mid-1999. In response to these attacks, Indian forces in the area have retaliated against local Muslims whom they accuse of supporting the militants. The brutal tactics they employ -- including summary executions, """"disappearances,"""" torture and rape -- have provoked widespread alienation from India. The Indian army has aggravated the situation by recruiting ex-servicemen, who for historical reasons are almost exclusively Hindu, to serve in Village Defence Committees (VDCs) that assist the army in military operations. In Doda and the border districts, where the population is nearly evenly divided between Hindus and Muslims, there is growing concern that tensions between the two communities might ignite a wider communal conflict. Although fighting has waned elsewhere in the Kashmir valley and the Indian government has claimed that """"normalcy"""" has returned, abuses by the army, federal paramilitary forces and a newly constituted police force are rife. Human rights defenders been killed, tortured and threatened, while detentions and """"disappearances"""" have left residents fearful of speaking out. Indian forces have also continued to arm countermilitant militias to work with the army and other security forces, but without any official accountability. These militias have assassinated human rights activists and journalists and have threatened and assaulted other civilians. Custodial killings -- the summary execution of detainees -- remain a central component of the Indian government's counterinsurgency strategy. In this report, Human Rights Watch documents nine that occurred in 1998 and one that occurred in 1997. The killings continue because senior Indian officials say there is no other way to counter a serious """"terrorist"""" threat. """"Disappearances"""" of detainees also remain a serious problem. Not only has the practice continued, but there has been no accountability for hundreds of cases of """"disappearances"""" that have taken place since 1990. Indian security forces also engage in brutal forms of torture which likewise have the sanction of senior officials. The latter privately justify the practice on the grounds that there is no other way to obtain information from a suspect. In fact, torture is also routinely used to punish suspected militants and their supporters, and to extort money from their families. Methods of torture include severe beatings with truncheons, rolling a heavy log on the legs, hanging the detainee upside down, and use of electric shocks. Indian security forces have raped women in Kashmir during search operations, particularly in remote areas outside of major cities and towns. Prosecutions of security personnel responsible for abuses are rare. The State Human Rights Commission's work is severely hampered by the fact that it cannot directly investigate abuses carried out by the army or other federal forces. Although government officials claim that disciplinary measures have been taken against some security personnel, criminal prosecutions do not take place. Militant groups operating in the Kashmir valley have also targeted civilians, assassinating political leaders, civil servants and suspected informers. They have massacred Hindu families and threatened others in an attempt to drive Hindus from the region. The report is based on a mission to Indian-controlled Kashmir in October 1998. India does not officially permit international human rights organizations to conduct investigations.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/16/letter-korean-president-kim-dae-jung","A letter to Korean President Kim Dae-jung","A letter to Korean President Kim Dae-jung","","07/16/1999","President Kim Dae-jung The Blue House 1 Sejong-no Chongno-gu Seoul Republic of Korea   Dear President Kim,   We, a group of American film makers who seek to defend artistic freedom around the world, write to voice our grave concern about the case of Mr. Suh Joon-sik. We understand that the South Korean government is seeking to imprison Mr. Suh for five years and suspend his civil liberties for five years as a result of showing the film Red Hunt at a Human Rights Film Festival in 1997. We feel that Mr. Suh has been unfairly prosecuted for what amounts to non-violent exercise of his right to free expression.  In October 1997, Mr. Suh planned to show Red Hunt, which documents official collusion in the 1948 massacre of alleged pro-communist sympathizers on Cheju island, at the second Korean Human Rights Film Festival on the campus of Hong-ik University. After he refused to submit the film to national film censors for review, Korean authorities pressured university officials to withdraw permission for their campus to be used for film screenings. Mr. Suh went ahead and screened the film nevertheless, and was then charged with trespassing. Prosecutors also charged him with violating the National Security Law, because they said the film aided North Korea.  Mr. Suh's trial began in January 1998 but recessed the following month, at the same time Mr. Suh was released on bail. By early this year, many who had followed the case were convinced that it had been quietly dropped by the Korean government. It seemed that under your stewardship, Korea was proving to be a country where peaceful exercise of freedom of expression was no longer seen as a security threat. Imagine our disappointment, therefore, when suddenly, the case seemed to be revived and the trial resumed in June.  Mr. Suh was originally supposed to be sentenced on July 6, 1999, but the court postponed the decision at the last minute until they viewed Red Hunt. As film makers, we recognize the incredible power of film and its ability to inspire and effect positive change. To deliberately censor an art form so rich in possibilities, so potent as a tool of unheard voices, is to rob people of a possibility to improve themselves and society. A truly democratic society, rather than censoring differing viewpoints, welcomes them as opportunities for intellectual and cultural growth.  Mr. President, we have welcomed your efforts to promote human rights not only in Korea, but also throughout Asia. If Mr. Suh is found guilty, the reputation not only of Korea but of you yourself as a champion of human rights will be badly tarnished.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/15/yugoslav-government-war-crimes-racak","Yugoslav Government War Crimes in Racak","Yugoslav Government War Crimes in Racak","","07/15/1999","Background The village of Racak, about half a kilometer from the town of Stimlje, had a pre-conflict population of approximately 2,000 people. During the large-scale government offensive in August 1998, the Serbian police shelled Racak, and several family compounds were looted and burned. Since then, most of the population has lived in Stimlje or nearby Urosevac. On the day before the January 15 attack, less then four hundred people were in the village. The KLA was also in Racak, with a base near the power plant. A number of ethnic Serbs were kidnapped in the Stimlje region, mostly during the summer. The January 15 attack might have been provoked by a well-prepared KLA ambush near Dulje (west of Stimlje) on January 8, in which three Serbian policeman were killed and one was wounded. On January 10, the KLA ambushed another police patrol in Slivovo (south of Stimlje), killing one policeman. A Yugoslav Army buildup in the area around Stimlje ensued over the next four days, especially on the mountain road between Dulje and Caraljevo villages. The Police Action in Racak Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they heard automatic weapons fire beginning around 6:30 a.m. on January 15, when the police reportedly exchanged fire with the KLA from a hill called Cesta. Half an hour later, army tanks and armored cars came as backup and shelled the forest near the neighboring village of Petrovo, where some KLA units were positioned. They also fired at some family compounds in Racak. Some families managed to escape Racak, fleeing towards Petrovo, which was also affected along with the villages of Malopoljce and Belinca. Around 7:00 a.m., Racak was surrounded by the Serbian police. Several witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they saw seven blue armored vehicles on Cesta hill, as well as three VJ tanks (type T-55). The police were shooting and some heavy artillery was fired directly into some houses near Malopoljce and Petrovo from a position in the nearby forest called, in Albanian, Pishat. The extent of the fighting in Racak that morning remains somewhat unclear. According to one Serbian policeman, the KLA's resistance around Racak lasted almost four hours, and when they were finally able to enter the village the police confiscated three mounted machine guns. Villagers, however, said that the police had entered the village by 9:00 a.m. They said that there was shooting and some artillery until 4:00 p.m. By 4:30 p.m., the police had left the village. Deliberate Killings of the Beqa Family Members Ten households of the Beqa family live in the part of Racak called Upper Mahalla on the edge of the village. According to one member of the family, whose son and husband were both killed, at around 7:00 a.m. thirty members of the Beqa family tried to run toward the nearby forest when they heard the police. She told Human Rights Watch that more then forty policemen wearing blue uniforms and without masks began shooting at them from a distance of twenty meters from the top of the hill. She said: My son H.B. was running on my left side, maybe two meters from me. He had his trousers in his hands, we did not have time to dress properly. He was warning me to move aside and suddenly he fell down. The bullet hit him in the neck. In front of me my husband fell as well. He didn't move any more. Another person in the same group, aged seventy, told Human Rights Watch how he saw his twenty-two-year-old grandson shot dead, while his eighteen-year-old granddaughter and her mother were both wounded. The other members of the Beqa family ran back to a house and hid under the steps until nightfall. Nobody dared to help the wounded, who spent two hours crawling for shelter from the police. One young women said that the police stayed on the hill singing songs and calling her relative by name in the Albanian language (""""Aziz, come here to see your dead relatives!""""), which suggests that local policemen from Stimlje who were familiar with the residents of Racak may have participated in the attack. Killed by Grenade According to M.B., who was hiding in his home, Bajram Mehmeti and his daughter Hanumshahe were killed by a grenade early in the morning of January 15 as they were running through the center of the village. He said: My cousins were lying twenty meters from the water well. He was hit in the head and she was hit in the chest. One man pulled her in the house and she died in his hands. Searching for Weapons and the Killing of Nazmi Ymeri (76) According to eleven different witnesses interviewed separately, groups of about thirty policemen each were entering Racak from different directions beginning around 7:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m., most of them had gathered in the village center near the mosque. These policemen also wore blue uniforms but they had masks on their faces with slits for their eyes and mouth, and they wore helmets. Some of them had """"rocket propelled grenades"""" strapped to their backs. These police searched house by house, witnesses said, looking for people and weapons. Most of the hidden civilians, upon seeing the police in the village center, ran in the opposite direction towards another part of the village. One witness, S.A. (46), was hiding with his wife and the five children of his neighbor between the house and stable of Hyrzi Bilalli. From this spot, he said he overheard a discussion held by a group of policemen. He told Human Rights Watch: I heard clearly when one said, """"Release everybody under the age of fifteen. You know what to do with the others."""" I heard when another one gave the order to pick up the bodies from the yards in plastic bags and put them in the cars. They took away the body of Ahmet's wife who was shot on the street while she was trying to run from one house to another. I later saw the place where her body was. It was just a pool of blood. The same witness said that the same group of policeman went into the next door house of the elderly Nazmi Imeri, who lived alone, and was later found dead. He said: I heard shooting and a scream. In the evening I went in his [Imeri's] yard and took his body to our yard. The top of the head was blown off. Torture in the Yard of Sadik Osmani As the police were in the Racak, many villager made their way, running and hiding, to the large house of Sadik Osmani near the place called, in Albanian, Kodra e Bebushit. One boy who was present, aged twelve, told Human Rights Watch that approximately thirty men and four boys, himself included, decided to hide in Osmani's stable. A group of approximately twenty women and children hid in the cellar of Osmani's three-storey house. The police later detained, beat, and executed the men in the stable (see below), but the women and children in the cellar were left unharmed. According to the boy, the police entered Osmani's yard sometime before noon. One tall policeman wearing a black mask and a helmet with a blue police uniform kicked in the door and immediately began to shoot over the heads of the thirty men lying on the ground, who were screaming """"Don't shoot! We are civilians!"""" All of the men were taken outside into the yard, where they were forced to lie on the ground and searched for weapons. The four boys were taken out of this group, including the twelve-year-old who spoke with Human Rights Watch, and were locked up together with the women and other children in Osmani's cellar. The police also took four men from the cellar -- Sadik Osmani, Burim Osmani, Rama Shabani, and Mufail Hajrizi -- and put them with the other men in the yard. Burim Osmani, who is a teenager around fifteen years old, was later put back into the cellar, apparently because he was too young. The conscious decision to return him, while later executing the others, suggests that the police had a clear order to kill the adult males of the village. Before the twelve-year-old boy was sent to the cellar, however, he saw how the police beat the men in the yard, including his father and some other relatives. The boy told Human Rights Watch: Two or three policeman beat them with wooden sticks. One was kicking them in the face with his boots. The others were just watching. It was terrible. The men were screaming, and their heads were covered with blood. A policeman locked me in the cellar with the women, but I could hear screaming for the next half an hour. This version of events was corroborated by three other women locked in the cellar who spoke with Human Rights Watch in two separate interviews, although they could not see the men in the yard. All of them believed that the police had only arrested their male relatives and taken them away to the police station in Stimlje. It was only the next day when they realized that the twenty-three men had been killed. Extrajudicial Executions Some time around 1:00 p.m. the police led the twenty-three men out of Osmani's yard. One witness, S. A., was hidden at that time behind a compound wall fifty meters from the Osmani house. He told Human Rights Watch that he heard the police leading the detained men through the Racak streets. He said: I heard the police ask them [the men] where is the headquarters of our army [the KLA], and they answered where it was. Then they went together toward the power station in the direction of our army. I think it was maybe 3:00 p.m. when I heard shooting, but I did not know that they were killed. Members of the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) entered Racak late in the afternoon of January 15, after having been prevented from entering the area during the day by VJ and police forces. The KVM took five wounded persons, including a woman and a boy suffering from gunshot wounds, and left. During the night, the remaining men of the village searched for the wounded, still thinking that the twenty-three men were in the Stimlje police station. One person who participated in the search told Human Rights Watch that they found the bodies on the hill called Kodri e Bebushit, in Albanian, around 4:00 a.m.. He said: I saw Mufail Hajrizi. He was slashed on the chest. Then we found Haqif, the guest from Petrovo. His body was lying on his side with the hands as if he wanted to defend himself. His throat and half his face had been cut by a knife. On the top of his head was a wooden stick with some paper. Something was written on that paper but I can't remember what it was. There were more than twenty bodies, almost all of them were my relatives. We wanted to cover the bodies with blankets, or something else, but one man said not to touch anything before KVM comes tomorrow. One woman, L.S., told Human Rights Watch that her son and husband had survived the execution. She told Human Rights Watch: In the morning I got information that the men from the stable were found dead. But soon I saw my husband and son coming toward me -- like they were standing up from the grave. My son told me that the group of policeman had pushed them with their hands behind their heads to go towards the hill. My son was in front with Sadik, and the others were behind. When he came to the top of the hill, he saw another group of policeman waiting for them with rifles. He turned his head and shouted to the others to run away. He ran toward the village of Rance, and didn't turn his head. One bullet crossed through his pocket, and another one is still in his belt. Precisely how the twenty-three men were killed by the police on the hill outside of Racak remains somewhat unclear. But witness testimony, as provided here, and the physical evidence found at the site by journalists and KVM monitors, makes it clear that most of these men were fired upon from close range as they offered no resistance. Some of them were apparently shot while trying to run away. Journalists at the scene early on January 16 told Human Rights Watch that many of these twenty-three men also had signs of torture, such as missing finger nails. Their clothes were bloody, with slashes and holes at the same spots as their bullet entry and exits wounds, which argues against government claims that the victims were KLA soldiers who were dressed in civilian clothes after they had been killed. All of them were wearing rubber boots typical of Kosovo farmers rather than military footwear. It is possible that some of these men were defending their village in the morning and then went to the Osmani house once they saw the police entering the village. However, they clearly did not resist the police at the time of their capture or execution. They were tortured and arbitrarily killed -- crimes that can never be justified in times of war or peace. The Forensic Investigation After a thorough inspection of the bodies by KVM, villagers collected the bodies and transported them to the Racak mosque. Two days later, however, under heavy arm, the police entered the village and took the corpses to the morgue in Prishtina. On January 25, head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Prishtina, Slavisa Dobricanin, announced that autopsies had been conducted on twenty-one bodies, some of them conducted in the presence of OSCE personnel. None of the bodies bore the signs of a massacre, he said. The OSCE did not comment on its impressions of the procedures or the announced results. A Finnish pathology team subsequently took over for the OSCE, and began to participate in the autopsy procedures together with the government authorities. The team distanced itself from Dobricanin's statements and, on January 26, expressed concern that there had been a tampering with the evidence, although they did not clarify by whom or when. The results of the Finns' investigations should be made public in early February. The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Human rights organizations can document the abuses taking place in Kosovo, and the international community can take steps to bring these abuses to an end. But only one institution has been entrusted by the international community to prosecute the persons responsible for violations of humanitarian law: the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The role of the ICTY is of crucial importance, as the prosecution of those who commit atrocities is likely to have a significant deterrence effect in addition to upholding the principles of international justice. ICTY's jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Kosovo is indisputable under the mandate established by U.N. Security Council resolution 827, and has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the U.N. Security Council in its resolutions on Kosovo, as well as by the tribunal itself. In the absence of any efforts on the part of Yugoslav authorities to bring the perpetrators of humanitarian law violations to justice, the ICTY represents the only avenue to prosecute abusers. The Yugoslav authorities have consistently refused to accept the jurisdiction of the ICTY, and have frustrated the work of ICTY investigators in Kosovo by denying them visas and barring them from carrying out investigations. Only a few ICTY investigators have been able to gain access to Kosovo, and even they have been officially prohibited by the Yugoslav authorities from interviewing persons or gathering evidence. The Yugoslav authorities base their refusal to cooperate with the ICTY on their view that the conflict in Kosovo is an internal dispute with """"terrorists,"""" a view repeatedly rejected by the ICTY, the U.N. Security Council, and other international actors, including Human Rights Watch. On January 18, Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, Louise Arbour, attempted to enter Kosovo through Macedonia in order to """"investigate the reported atrocities in Racak."""" She did not have a Yugoslav visa, having been denied one by the authorities, and was refused entry into the country. Back in The Hague, Arbour stated unequivocally that she will be investigating the massacre in Racak """"with or without access to the territory."""" Regarding the fears of evidence tampering, she said: Evidence of tampering -- should such evidence become available, is, in fact, excellent circumstantial evidence of guilt. If one can trace where the order to tamper came from, it permits a pretty strong inference that it was done for the purpose of hiding the truth, which demonstrates consciences of guilt. Western governments and the Contact Group, including Russia, have called on President Milosevic to cooperate with the ICTY. More than just a visa for Arbour, this should mean unrestricted access for ICTY's investigators to Racak and the sites of other humanitarian law violations in Kosovo committed by both the KLA and the government.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

A new 49-page report by Human Rights Watch details how President Aleksandr Lukashenka's government has suppressed research on controversial topics, re-centralized academic decision- making, and maintained a ban on political activity on campuses. At the same time, a systematic crackdown on political dissent on campus has targeted outspoken students and lecturers who are threatened with expulsion, often for their off-campus political activity.  """"President Lukashenka is strangling intellectual life in Belarus,""""said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This drive for political control on campuses mirrors what he has done to the rest of civil society.""""  Since President Lukashenka's election in 1994, the government has hounded or disbanded opposition political parties and nongovernmental organizations, and has stripped independent lawyers of their accreditation. His regime has also harassed and arrested peaceful political activists, and has severely curtailed the independent media. State university authorities issue reprimands and warnings to politically active lecturers, independent historians, and other academics. University employees who challenge the status quo are told to curtail political activities or change the focus of their academic enquiry.  State university administrators target research into politically sensitive issues, such as the Belarusian independence movement during the Soviet era, a theme that is seen to challenge state policy of integration with Russia and is actively dissuaded. """"President Lukashenka has made his own historical interpretation a keystone of the government's integration policy,"""" said Ms. Cartner. """"Independent historians are today viewed in the same light as oppositionist politicians.""""  The Human Rights Watch report traces the politicization of history in Belarus. Beginning in the perestroika period, historians enjoyed a free rein to research and publish on issues that were formerly taboo. Now, that freedom has gradually been restricted. Historians who have researched Belarus' national past or Stalinist atrocities face restrictions in their work. Historians and researchers who publish or organize conferences on such themes are attacked in polemics in the state press and refused access to the media to publish their responses.  High school and university history textbooks written and published in the post-Soviet period have gradually been removed from the classroom and replaced with standard Soviet-era editions by order of the government. The report exposes the insidious role that the Belarusian Patriotic Union of Youth (BPSM) plays on campuses. Formed on the initiative of President Lukashenka, the BPSM is a vigorously pro- presidential youth organization that appears to be modeled on the Soviet-era Komsomol. It has representative offices in every state university and institution of higher education, and its goal is to politically indoctrinate young people and keep them from getting involved in opposition politics. BPSM members receive privileges and discounts on campus and in stores. By contrast, students who are active in opposition politics or demonstrations face warnings, fines, imprisonment and expulsion from their place of study because of their political activity. The government funds and provides campus facilities for the BPSM, and actively promotes membership in it as necessary for students who want to get ahead. But it bans from campuses any independent organizations deemed political.  Private education has proven no easy escape from the stifling atmosphere of state universities. Local authorities employ a range of tactics, some of them ridiculous, in their persistent harassment of public lecture programs. In 1998, local authorities denied a group of lawyers in the southern Belarusian city of Pruzhany permission to hold a seminar on human rights by claiming there was an """"epidemic"""" in the town.  In another incident that year, participants in a seminar organized by a group of young intellectuals held in a newspaper's editorial offices, were subsequently interviewed by the KGB, which was anxious to determine who the organizers were, what was said and with what funds. Human Rights Watch called on the Belarusian government to stop its repression against politically active students and faculty, and to reinstate those who have been expelled for their political beliefs and activities, including Denis Bobikov and Anatol' Britsen formerly of the Gorky Academy of Agriculture, Evgenny Skochko, formerly of the Belarusian State Technical Univeristy, and Ales' Mukhin formerly of SISRU State Information System and Radioelectronics University. The organization also called on the international community, including the government of the Russian Federation, publicly to condemn and use its political and economic influence to bring an end to violations of academic freedom, freedom of expression, association, and assembly in Belarus.

Wednesday's conviction of Mahbuba Kasymova, 48, is the latest in a series of government attacks on the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan. Eyewitnesses at the trial reported that the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (NOPCHU) as """"an illegal organization,"""" and accused Kasymova of committing """"illegal actions"""" in connection with her work there. """"Mrs. Kasymova's conviction is a farce,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"It appears the government of Uzbekistan's goal is to silence all the independent human rights activists."""" Kasymova's conviction follows the June 19 death in detention of NOPCHU member Akhmadkhon Turakhonov, the June 25 arrest and beating of NOPCHU chairman Mikhail Ardzinov, and the July 12 arrest of NOPCHU activist Ismail Adylov. At 9 am on July 12, authorities requested that Mrs. Kasymova come to the courthouse, but did not state that proceedings would begin, thereby depriving her of the right to the counsel of her choice. Judge Erkin Iusupov of the Iunusabad District Court also refused to postpone the hearing so that key witnesses could testify in Kasymova's defense. During the hearing Judge Iusupov ignored evidence presented by Mrs. Kasymova in her own defense. In May, prosecutors charged Kasymova, a longtime human rights activist and member of the banned Birlik (Unity) Democratic Party, with harboring a criminal, article 241 of the Uzbek criminal code. In June, prosecutors filed additional charges of fraud against Kasymova, in connection with money she claims was borrowed from a neighbor. On May 12, police arrested Ravshan Khamidov, a friend of the Kasymov family who had been living with them in their Tashkent apartment since November 1998. Authorities have charged Khamidov, who has been in detention since that time, with involvement in the February 16 bombings in Tashkent. Khamidov, who has yet to be tried, denies this allegation, and has also denied being in hiding while living with the Kasymovs in Tashkent. During a search of the Kasymov's home, according to family members, police planted both a hand grenade and forbidden Islamic leaflets in Khamidov's possessions. Human Rights Watch has interviewed nearly one hundred persons in 1998 and 1999 who tell similar stories of evidence planting by police. The day after Khamidov's arrest, Uzbekistan's state television news program showed Kasymova's picture and described her as a """"criminal."""" Police repeatedly summoned for questioning Kasymova's family members, including her young daughters, and plainclothes police constantly monitored her home. On May 20, police detectives brought Kasymova in for questioning, and then transported her to her neighborhood council headquarters, where she was subjected to a four-hour denunciation session by local activists. When she tried to leave, she was surrounded by four police officers, and forced to stand silently while those present denounced her. The state television news program broadcast portions of this session, again describing Kasymova as a criminal. Uzbek authorities had previously used this technique, reminiscent of Stalinist times, against other human rights activists.

The Hellman/Hammett grants are given annually by Human Rights Watch to writers around the world who have been targets of political persecution. The grant program began in 1989 when the estates of American authors Lillian Hellman and Dashiel Hammett asked Human Rights Watch to design a program for writers in financial need as a result of expressing their views. This year's grants totaled $170,000.  In many countries, writers are threatened, harassed, assaulted, or thrown into jail merely for providing information from non-governmental sources. Governments often use military and presidential decrees, criminal libel, and colonial-era sedition laws to silence critics. As a result many journalists and writers are forced to practice self-censorship.  Short biographies of the 1999 recipients are available here.  Other recipients will remain anonymous because of the dangerous circumstances in which they are living. They include writers from Belarus, Cameroon, China, Eritrea, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, United States, and Vietnam.  The Hellman/Hammett grants are announced each spring. In the nine previous years of the program, more than 350 writers have received grants totaling more than one-and-a-half million dollars.  The Hellman/Hammett funds also make small emergency grants from time to time throughout the year for writers who have an urgent need to leave their country or who find themselves in desperate financial circumstances as a result of political persecution. Again, Sub-Sahara Africa is home to the most grantees. Among them are: Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto from Zimbabwe; Edith Lianue Gongloe and Alphonos Onso Nyenuh from Liberia; Andrew Koromah, Kevin Lewis, Winston Ojukutu-Macauley, and David Tam-Baryoh from Sierra Leone.

The demonstration on July 8 involved a few hundred students. Eye witnesses told Human Rights Watch that police officers observed the demonstration but did not intervene, and the students returned to their dormitory without incident. It appears that at about 4.30 am on July 9, police allowed members of Ansar-e Hezbollah to enter the dormitory. They attacked students and attemped to take some of them away. Students reportedly responded by fighting the attackers and protesting the abduction of their colleagues. As the conflict escalated, 300 armed police entered the campus shooting in the air and firing tear gas. The students were driven back into their dormitories. At this point, hundreds of purported members of the Ansar-e Hezbollah were admitted to the dormitory buildings and systematically ransacked student rooms, destroyed property and assaulted students. During this assault, according to the independent newspaper Neshat, 300 students were wounded, 400 taken into detention and four were killed. By 7.00 am the clash was over. After Friday prayers at midday on July 9, students held a rally on the university campus to protest the assault on the dormitory. Hezbollah again attacked with sticks and chains while the police reportedly stood by or joined in the attacks.  Your Excellency, these events yet again highlight the role of organized civilian groups claiming religious authority to carry out acts of violence and lawlessness, and the close collaboration with these groups of police and security forces. These actions contribute to the acute problem of lack of accountability on the part of the police and law enforcement personnel. Human Rights Watch calls on Your Excellency to ensure that a thorough, public, and independent inquiry is carried out into the events of July 9, and that those responsible for wrong-doing are identified and brought to justice. In this regard, Human Rights Watch welcomes the July 10 statement of the Supreme National Security Council calling for a comprehensive inquiry into the incident, and for holding accountable those responsible. We urge you to ensure that these directives are carried out immediately.  All those responsible for assaulting students and taking part in other illegal acts should be prosecuted. The role of Tehran police chief General Hedayat Lotfian, who has been identified in press accounts as the officer responsible for ordering the assault on the campus, should be made clear. If it turns out that he was acting on orders from higher authorities, then those responsible should also be identified and held accountable. Law enforcement personnel should protect citizens from the lawless actions of violent organized civilians and never act in collusion with them. Finally, all students detained in this illegal action who have not been charged with any internationally recognizable crime should be released. Insofar as the Minister of the Interior, Hojatoleslam Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari, has stated that the assault on the campus took place without the ministry's approval, Your Excellency should take steps to ensure that authority over law-enforcement personnel resides with responsible government officials, in accordance with the law, and subject to judicial oversight.  Your Excellency, the themes of accountability and upholding the rule of law lie at the root of the events at Tehran University on July 9, 1999. Since September 1998 dozens of newspapers have been closed down in proceedings that violated the law. The closure of Salam newspaper, which initiated the students' protest, was triggered by that newspaper's reporting of the alleged role of Saeed Emami, a high ranking Ministry of Information official, in efforts by the parliament to restrict freedom of the press. Mr. Emami was implicated in the killings of writers and intellectuals in 1998 and is alleged to have committed suicide in prison in late June 1999. Newspapers have been at the forefront of efforts to expose official involvement in the killings of a number of journalists and intellectuals at the end of 1998.  Your Excellency, as Leader of the Islamic Republic, you are constitutionally responsible for overseing the functioning of all branches of the government. The executive branch of government cannot fulfill its proper functions as long as the institutions under your supervision fail to comply with their obligations under Iranian and international law. You should exercise your authority to ensure that officials implicated in illegal assaults and killings are exposed and prosecuted, to ensure that freedom of the press is respected, and to ensure that law enforcement operations are carried out in accordance with the law.

Human Rights Watch considers that Adylov's detention is part of a wider government crackdown on human rights activists, designed to silence criticism of the mass arrests and torture of religious Muslims being carried out by Uzbekistan authorities. """"Mr. Adylov has attempted to defend the rights of hundreds of believers who have been harrassed, jailed and tortured by the state,"""" noted Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Sadly, the Uzbek authorities believe that defending human rights is a crime."""" Human Rights Watch is seriously concerned for the physical safety of Adylov. A longtime activist, he is a member of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan, chaired by Mikhail Ardzinov, who was recently brutally beaten by Uzbek authorities during 14 hours in detention. There is a great risk of torture during pre-trial detention in Uzbekistan, particularly in cases where suspects are held incommunicado. In addition, Adylov is ill with kidney disease and was released from hospital treatment only one week before officers took him into custody. He continues to require medical attention. Human Rights Watch has gathered testimony from numerous people this past week who allege that police have planted leaflets from a banned organization on observant Muslims. In May, authorities charged another member of Adylov's group, Mahbuba Kasymova, with harboring a suspected terrorist after allegedly planting leaflets in her home; her trial is due to begin shortly. Thousands more independent Muslims and self-proclaimed members of Hizb ut-Takhrir (Party of Liberation), a group advocating the re-establishment of the Caliphate through non-violent means, are believed to have been arrested in recent months. On June 14, Tashkent police detained Farkhod Usmanov, reportedly for possession of a leaflet. The son of a well-known imam, Nosir-kori Usmanov, he was held in incommunicado detention for 11 days. On June 25, his body was returned to his family along with a death certificate claiming the 42-year old died of heart failure. Human Rights Watch representatives who viewed the body reported that it was covered with bruises and other markings suggesting Usmanov died from torture in custody. A Human Rights Watch report documenting harassment and abuse of human rights activists by authorities in Uzbekistan is forthcoming. Human Rights Watch has pieced together a brief chronicle of Mr. Adylov's detention. At approximately 8:30 pm on July 10, two plainclothes officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and one officer from the local police precinct came to Adylov's home, demanded his passport, and told him a member of his neighborhood governing council wanted to speak with him. Adylov agreed to accompany the officers along with his wife, Mamura Adylova. When the couple reached the street however, they found three cars with six more officers in civilian clothes waiting. The officers put Adylov into one of the cars, telling his wife that they were taking him to the MVD and that she could see him again the next morning at 11am. However, the next day officials refused even to tell her where he was being held. Uzbek law requires that a person held for questioning by police be released by 11 pm of the day of their detention. At 12 noon on July 11, Human Rights Watch's representative arrived at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where a duty officer claimed to have no information regarding Adylov and refused to notify a superior officer who could provide such information. Over 24 hours after authorities detained Adylov, family members and local and international human rights activists have been unable to confirm his wherabouts. About 1.5 hours after officers took Adylov into custody Saturday evening, 30 additional plainclothes MVD officers came to his home according to family members. Soldiers in uniform carrying machine guns closed off the street surrounding the neighborhood. When Mrs. Adylova refused to let the officers conduct a search without her husband present, they threatened to order the soldiers to attack the house and enter by force. She relented, and they entered without presenting a search warrant. The officers ransacked the family home, confiscated Adylov's human rights documents, and allegedly planted a plastic bag with 100 leaflets of the banned Islamic group Hizb ut-Takhrir in a notebook. Adylov's daughter reported that before the search, when she took her fathers' passport out of that same notebook to give to the police, no leaflets were there.  Authorities earlier threatened to charge Adylov with membership in Hizb ut-Takhrir. In June, a judge presiding over a trial of Hizb ut-Takhrir members publicly threatened to charge Adylov, who was monitoring the trial, with membership in the group.  Adylov, still a member of the governing council of the banned Birlik (Unity) Democratic Party, was repeatedly taken in for questioning in 1991 and 1992 in connection with his political activities. In August 1994 he was held in the basement of the National Security Service (SNB, formerly the KGB) for three days.

""""This is a terribly harsh sentence,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Right's Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Bahrain has a history of using arbitrary detention, huge fines and lengthy sentences to silence political opposition, but this is a new low."""" Relatives who visited al-Jamri during his detention say that he resisted repeated attempts to pressure him to sign a prepared confession that he ordered arson and sabotage attacks and acted on behalf of a foreign power. The court convicted al-Jamri of spying for a foreign country and directing an organization seeking to overthrow the government, although Bahrain has never made public evidence to support these allegations. At his closed trial, al-Jamri maintained that he had committed no criminal acts, and only called for the restoration of the National Assembly, which Bahrain dissolved in 1975. Bahraini law severely restricts freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Since creating the State Security Courts in 1976, the government has used them to prosecute a wide variety of vaguely worded offenses. The security courts fail to meet international fair trial standards, including the right to a public trial; the right to appeal the conviction and sentence to a higher tribunal; the right to prepare a defense and communicate with counsel; and the right to examine witnesses. An elected member of the dissolved National Assembly known for his speeches criticizing the government, al-Jamri has been in prison for more than three and a half years, including nineteen months in solitary confinement. He was arrested after participating in calls by the People's Petition Committee for the release of prisoners, the return of persons forcibly exiled, and the relaxation of restrictions on free expression and association. In 1995 he was also detained for six months without charge after calling for the release of prisoners and the reinstatement of the National Assembly. The first session of the trial was held in February 1999, over three years after Sheikh al-Jamri's arrest on January 21, 1996 and a full month after the expiration of the maximum administrative detention period allowed in Bahraini law. Only then was he formally charged. Additional court sessions were held on July 4 and July 6, 1999. The four sessions together lasted a little more than three hours and were closed to the public. As in other security court cases, Al-Jamri's lawyers had only very limited access to their client. """"The security courts should be abolished,"""" Megally said. """"The laws they prosecute and their rules of procedure practically guarantee an unfair trial."""" Seven other opposition leaders arrested at the same time as al-Jamri remain in prison without charge or trial. Like al-Jamri, `Abd al-Wahab Hussain, Hasan Mushaima, `Ali Ahmad Howarah, Hasan `Ali Muhammad Sultan, Ibrahim `Adan Nasir al-`Alawi, Abd al-`Ashur al-Satrawi, and Husain `Ali Hasan al-Daihi have been detained without judicial review in violation of international fair trial standards and Bahraini law. """"In three and a half years Bahrain has not presented a shred evidence that would justify holding these eight people,"""" Megally said. """"This raises serious questions about the real reasons for their detention. They should all be immediately released if the government is unwilling to try them before a court that meets international standards.""""

While claiming to protect the public from pornography, the governments of Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Bahrain, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates also block access to some human rights and political websites. Iraq and Libya, meanwhile, are not even linked to the global Internet, while Syria is the only country in the region that has a link but has refused thus far to make local access available to its citizens. Tunisia leads the region in adopting Internet-specific laws—many designed to ensure that critical speech is subjected to the same restrictions as in other media.  """"Authorities in this region are used to keeping tight reins on the media, but they cannot control the free-flowing Internet,"""" said Hanny Megally, Human Rights Watch's executive director for the Middle East and North Africa. """"Instead of erecting barriers that cannot stand for long, these governments should work to make online communication widely available.""""  Many users in the region worry about high-tech surveillance of their online activities and e-mail correspondence. Such fears are understandable in a region where the police frequently wiretap the phones and fax machines of suspected dissidents, and telecommunication networks are still largely in state hands. In one instance, a Bahraini spent nearly two years in detention on suspicion of e-mailing political information to opposition groups overseas.  But the development of tools to protect against censorship and surveillance online, such as encryption, anonymous re-mailing, anti-censorship proxy servers, and wireless communications, seems to be outpacing the technologies of control, noted Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. People in the Middle East are already using the Internet to erode controls on information. Local human rights organizations are disseminating news more effectively than ever and newspapers are posting stories online that were censored from their print editions. Viewpoints that are restricted or taboo locally—such as pro-Islamist views in Algeria and pro-Polisario views in Morocco—are readily available to Internet users in those countries. Not all governments have been actively trying to control the Internet. Egypt and Jordan are among those that allow news and commentary online even when it has been censored or is considered taboo in the print media. Governments tolerate this paradox in part because the cost of Internet access—as high as U.S.$70 per month in some countries—ensures a small and mostly elite audience. """"Internet speech may seem low on the human rights agenda in a region where torture is commonplace and a computer is beyond the means of the average household,"""" observed Megally. """"But the Internet is actually most important in repressive countries, where people now have the power to send and receive information."""" After a slow start, Internet use is growing in the Middle East and North Africa. Information technology receives much attention from Arab media and is the subject of frequent conferences. Cybercaf? welcome the public in at least fourteen countries. But the region still lags far behind North America, South America, Europe and Asia in terms of connectivity per capita. A shortage of Arabic content and antiquated telecommunication sectors also hampers Internet growth. In the 92-page survey report issued today, Human Rights Watch unveiled policy guidelines aimed at protecting the rights to privacy, association and expression online. Among the recommendations:  Censoring mechanisms, if used, should be in the hands of individual users, and not governments; Strong encryption should be available to individuals; Government surveillance of electronic communications should not infringe unduly on the right to privacy and other civil rights, and should be subject to the requirements of due process and judicial supervision; and Individuals should have the right to communicate and receive information anonymously.  The report, which contains written responses from the governments of Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Tunisia, and Yemen, is available online here beginning July 8.

The organization also released fresh evidence of ongoing rebel atrocities in Sierra Leone.   In a letter to Annan written on the eve of his visit to Sierra Leone on July 8, Human Rights Watch urges him to disassociate the U.N. from any general amnesty for those who have committed atrocities during the eight-year civil war. Peace talks are currently underway in Lome, Togo. They are being facilitated by the U.N., the Organization of African Unity, and other organizations.   """"The atrocities committed in Sierra Leone have shocked the world,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The United Nations must not sponsor a peace agreement that pretends they never happened.""""   The testimonies that Human Rights Watch released today describe abuses by the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), including executions of civilians and gang rape of children committed in violation of a ceasefire agreement which went into effect on May 24. A copy of several testimonies is attached, as well as the letter to Secretary-General Annan.   Human Rights Watch welcomed Annan's brief visit to Freetown as a sign of high-level U.N. concern for Sierra Leone. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, also visited Sierra Leone on June 24-25.   Human Rights Watch urged all parties at the Togo peace talks to insist that mechanisms of accountability, including trials and punishment for those who have committed the worst atrocities, be included in any final peace accord.   Human Rights Watch also suggested that the U.N. Secretary-General use the opportunity of his visit to Freetown to call for greater international support for the ECOMOG peacekeeping effort of mostly Nigerian forces, which have been deployed in Freetown since 1997. The organization also called on ECOMOG forces to respect international humanitarian law.   Sierra Leone Testimonies   Human Rights Watch has taken testimonies of survivors and witnesses from seven villages around the towns of Port Loko and """"Mile 91,"""" who describe civilians being hacked to death, shot as they tried to flee, and rounded up and executed in houses. Some women were also abducted, forced to carry looted goods and later raped.   A farmer described being one of seventeen civilians rounded up by the rebels on June 23, stripped and put in a room where ten people were later executed. One twelve year old girl described being abducted on June 25, forced to carry looted rice, and later gang raped by nine RUF rebels. The attacks took place during or after raids to obtain food, and were accompanied by widespread destruction of property.   One man, interviewed in Port Loko on July 5, described how a group of fifty rebels surrounded the village of Melikuru on June 23 and proceeded to round up seventeen men and women who were stripped naked and placed in a room. Ten of these civilians were later gunned down by a rebel who identified himself as the commander. The victim told Human Rights Watch:   At around noon as I was riding my bike to my house, about fifty rebels entered the town firing. We all started running but they caught those of us who couldn't get away. They stripped me completely naked and walked me to Mr. Sadigie's house where they pushed me into a room with fifteen other men and two women from our village. They were all naked too. The rebels were going house to house; looting every grain of food we had from our houses and even set many of them on fire.  A rebel calling himself the commander accused us of supporting the local militias and said he was going to kill us all. Three other rebels stood by the door so we couldn't run and we started to beg for our lives and recite prayers. A few minutes later the rebels took seven of us out, and said we would be used to carry the looted goods to their camp. Then the commander walked back into the house and opened fire on the ten men left inside. They went around the room to make sure all of them were dead. Only one man was still alive so another rebel set upon him with a machete until he died. I knew all of them: Abubakar Kanu and his father Hassan were both killed, Pa Santigie Fallah and Pa Gbassay Bangura, Brima Conteh, Pa Sullay and the others; all dead. They gave me a shirt, put a rope around my waist like a goat and forced me to walk over ten hours with a bag of rice on my head until we reached the rebel base at Lunsar.   A twelve year old girl and twenty-five year old woman interviewed on July 4 in the village of Rosar, three miles from Port Loko, described being abducted by RUF rebels on June 25, who forced them to carry looted goods and later gang-raped them. The twelve year old told Human Rights Watch:   At around 8:00 p.m. we heard gunshots and started to run into the bush but what seemed like about one hundred armed men came into our village from all directions. I was in my house with my mom and dad. We all tried to run into the bush but I was caught. They surrounded the village and went house to house taking everything; rice, palm oil, clothes. They said they were the RUF and I recognized one of them from the last time they attacked Port Loko. They shot Mabinty Kagbo and her husband right on their verandah; Mabinty died. She was the mother of three children. They rounded up three of us to carry away what they'd stolen and forced us to walk for over six hours. I carried a heavy bag of rice on my head until we reached their base. After we'd arrived they put me alone in a room and four of them raped me on the floor. They hit me with a stick and slapped me. They put a knife to my throat and said if I resisted they'd kill me right there. In the morning three more of them raped me. I was bleeding but they said they didn't care.  In the morning they made me and the two other women they'd taken from the village pound a bushel of rice. They offered us food but we refused. A few hours later after the rebels had eaten and played football, the commander told us to go back to our village. But on the way three more rebels chased after us and a few miles from the rebel base, took us into the bushes and raped me and my neighbor Fatmata. Two more of them raped me before they finally let us go. I could barely walk back to my village. Even now I'm not right.   A twenty-eight year old woman from Ropolon village, interviewed on July 4 by Human Rights Watch near Mile 91, described an attack around June 20, in which rebels hacked her uncle, Pa Mohammed, and two other male villages to death.   A group of them dressed in full combats entered the town in the early morning. They were the same rebels who'd attacked us at least five times over the last several months. We knew them, they were always looking for food. This time they had machetes and knives and as I was running I heard them say """"just because it's a ceasefire it doesn't mean 'ceaseloot' or 'cease-cut-glass'"""" [ie. cut with machetes]. I hid in the bush with my grandmother and new-born baby girl and when we came back several hours later we found my uncle and two more young men hacked and stabbed to death outside their houses.   These atrocities are consistent with a long-standing pattern of gross and systematic abuses by the RUF, including the widespread and indiscriminate murder, rape, abduction and mutilation of the civilian population and constitute grave breaches of the laws of war and crimes against humanity.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/06/letter-president-clinton","Letter to President Clinton","Letter to President Clinton","","07/06/1999","Human Rights Watch made public today a letter to President Clinton calling on the United States to support the first-ever conference of the Geneva Conventions signatories, scheduled for July 15, 1999.  For this reason, we are greatly concerned by recent statements of Vice-President Al Gore and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk indicating that your administration is intent on derailing the meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention as recommended by a series of United Nations General Assembly """"Uniting for Peace"""" resolutions, most recently Resolution ES-10/6 of February 9, 1999, and scheduled for July 15. The United States was one of two states voting against these resolutions. On May 23, Vice-President Gore told the annual meeting of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee that """"we will work diligently to halt the meeting.... America will boycott it, and we will urge others to do the same."""" On June 8, Assistant Secretary Indyk, in a prepared statement to the House International Relations Committee, declared that """"the Administration is working hard to see that the proposed July 15 meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention does not take place. We have voiced our opposition to such a meeting in the strongest terms, have made clear that we would not attend a meeting if it takes place, and we have encouraged all others to do likewise."""" According to Assistant Secretary Indyk, the administration believes that """"[t]his meeting will not contribute to the peace process,"""" and he compared it to """"unilateral steps—such as unilateral declaration of statehood or provocative settlement activity—that could prejudge the outcome of permanent status negotiations.""""  In adopting this stance, the administration would subordinate the international community's humanitarian law obligations to the political negotiations you have been promoting between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions enjoins the U.S. as well as the other High Contracting Parties """"to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances."""" We recognize that the administration has set a very high priority on a successful outcome of this negotiating process. At the same time, we consider it to be a grave error for the U.S. to insist that steps to address ongoing violations of international humanitarian law should be set aside in deference to this effort. We do not believe that the administration wishes to assert that the process or outcome of these negotiations are incompatible with full respect for international humanitarian law.This, however, is the clear implication of the statements of the vice president and the assistant secretary. To let their statements stand unamended is to set a terrible precedent for enforcement of international humanitarian law not only in this but also in other ongoing and future conflicts.  International humanitarian law was developed and codified precisely to govern the behavior of states and other actors in situations of armed conflict, including military occupations. It provides a baseline for protections that must govern the practices of the parties to a conflict. The principles of international humanitarian law can and should contribute to the process of negotiating a peaceful resolution to this conflict. In any case, the requirement to comply with and enforce the protections of civilians embodied in the Fourth Geneva Convention is not a matter that is contingent on the outcome of negotiations between the parties to a conflict.  To equate an effort to enforce international humanitarian law with violations of that law, as Assistant Secretary Indyk did in his June 8 statement, betrays a misunderstanding of the principles of humanitarian law, and runs counter to the stress you yourself have often placed on the importance of the rule of law in international relations. Subsequently, at a press briefing on June 29 in connection with the visit of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, Assistant Secretary Indyk declared that """"there is in the Geneva Accords no mechanism—a mechanism does not exist. It has been invented for the purposes of trying to put Israel in a corner on the settlement issue."""" He subsequently referred to the proposed meeting as """"some international forum which doesn't have a basis in the Conventions for a meeting, and which cannot produce a positive result, by its very nature.""""  The language of Article 1?to respect and ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances""""—is clear: responsibility lies in the first instance with the occupying power to ensure that its practices comply with the law. Israel, alone among the High Contracting Parties to the Conventions, disputes the applicability of the Fourth Convention to the lands it occupied in 1967. In such a case where the refusal of a party to a conflict to accept applicability renders the internal enforcement mechanism inoperable, other High Contracting Parties are enjoined to consider steps to bring about compliance. While the Convention does not specify remedies or recommend actions to secure respect by another High Contracting Party, it clearly envisions that steps will be taken. Article 149 of the Convention, moreover, states that """"No High Contracting Party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other High Contracting Party of any liability incurred by itself or by another High Contracting Party"""" regarding grave breaches.  One hundred and fifteen of the 188 High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions, including virtually all of the major allies of the U.S. such as Canada, Netherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom have voted as members of the U.N. General Assembly, in accordance with Article 1 of the U.N. Charter, to reaffirm their duty under common Article 1 of the Conventions. They thereby initiated an effort to consider appropriate and adequate steps, individual and joint, to enforce the Conventions. The resolution called on Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the territories it has occupied since 1967, and to reverse actions that contravene this Convention. The resolution reflects the failure of earlier efforts by many of these same High Contracting Parties, bilaterally and via the U.N., to gain Israel's compliance in this regard.  The purpose of the conference called for by the resolutions is to consider steps that High Contracting Parties might take individually or in a collective fashion to address enforcement of the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention in this case. Of Israel's recognized grave breaches of the Convention, it is the policies of systematic seizure of land and resources, and population transfer, that intersect most directly with the pending final status negotiations. Although in recent years the U.S. has preferred to criticize Israel's settlements policies in terms of their negative impact on negotiations, for many years U.S. government officials at the highest levels quite properly characterized those policies as being violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. While the conference of High Contracting Parties is not and should not be designed to address the political issues in dispute between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, neither is it justified or consistent for the U.S. and Israel to decide unilaterally that certain practices, because they are also salient issues of political dispute, cannot and should not be addressed as grave breaches of international humanitarian law. Although this would be the first convening of a meeting by High Contracting Parties to address matters of compliance and enforcement, it is not entirely without precedent. You will recall, for instance, that in 1995, at the time of the war in Chechnya, special meetings were held in the framework of the OSCE and in other settings to address grave breaches of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict, including Russia. Likewise, numerous meetings have been convened under U.N. and other auspices to address violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia and the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. The particular modality of the meeting called for in General Assembly Resolution ES-10/6 of February 9, 1999 is indeed new, but the concept of holding such meetings is now enshrined in international practice. The meeting called for here will itself invariably be precedent-setting. It is crucial that those precedents lend support to the principle of accountability for violations of the laws of war. The modality of the conference called for by the High Contracting Parties remains open. It could, for instance, be informal and in camera. The agenda can and should be designed in a way to avoid at all costs politicization of the High Contracting Parties' consideration of the range of instruments and mechanisms available to them for restoring respect for the rights of Protected Persons under the Convention. Rather than a terminal process, the conference could be designed as an initial forum to set in motion a process of continued contact among participating High Contracting parties on matters of enforcement.  Human Rights Watch believes that this initiative can represent an important step forward in international efforts to promote compliance with international humanitarian law and accountability for violations of that law. It is also our conviction that a stable and durable peace between Israel and the Palestinians must rest on the respect of all parties for internationally guaranteed human rights and international humanitarian law. The protections provided to civilians in the Fourth Geneva Convention cannot and should not be open to political bargaining. We regard it as unfortunate that the U.S. government feels obliged politically to decline to participate in the July 15 meeting of the High Contracting Parties. Even if this remains your position, however, we urge you in the strongest terms to ensure that the U.S. does not campaign to undermine this conference in any manner. Finally, we urge your administration to affirm publicly that respect for international humanitarian law generally and the Geneva Conventions in particular remains a bedrock principle of U.S. policy, and that the protections afforded by the conventions are not a matter for negotiations between parties to a conflict.

A new report from Human Rights Watch charges that the Tanzanian army separated the refugees from their families and stripped them of their belongings in an indiscriminate response to security risks from outside the country. """"Tanzania has a long and generous tradition of hospitality to refugees, but unfortunately, it hasn't been on display in this crisis,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"All of a sudden, people have been dragged from their homes and treated like criminals solely because they are refugees."""" The report, """"In the Name of Security,"""" calls on the Tanzanian government to restore the long-standing refugees to their old settlements and to seek alternate means to address valid security concerns that don't violate national and international law. The Tanzanian army conducted house-to-house sweeps largely in late 1997 and early 1998 on the grounds that this was necessary to protect Tanzanian citizens living near the Burundian border. The Burundian government had alleged that Burundian rebels based in Tanzania were engaged in arms trafficking and cross-border incursions. The Burundian government threatened to act if the Tanzanian government did not.  With little or no notice, the Tanzanian army swept through villages close to the Burundian and Rwandan borders, apprehending thousands of refugees from their homes and sending them to the refugee camps. The Human Rights Watch report contains testimonies from Burundian refugees, many of whom had built homes, farms, and livelihoods in the government-provided settlements for over two decades, who spoke with regret about their destroyed communities, empty looted homes, and ruined crops. One refugee man who had lived in Tanzania since 1972 stated: The army came and told us to pack what we could carry. They would only say, """"All Burundians must go to the camps."""" . . . It took us five or six hours to reach Kibirizi where we found other people who had been rounded up as well as new refugee arrivals. . . I had been separated from my wife and children . . . I don't know when I will see my family again. To date, refugees in Tanzania continue to live with the uncertainty and fear that they could be subjected again to similar arbitrary mistreatment. Refugees who have been able to get back to their former homes have found their personal belongings gone, their schools and other community institutions closed, and relations with their Tanzanian neighbors fraught with distrust. The Human Rights Watch report---published in the wake of a June visit to the region by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata--notes that the large refugee flows from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have indeed taken a heavy toll on neighboring countries, such as Tanzania, that host the hundreds of thousands who flee violence and insecurity. The large refugee populations have exacerbated economic strains and environmental degradations in host countries, and militants among the refugees have caused crime and insecurity. There have been reports that Burundian rebels are operating from Tanzanian bases, importing weapons through Tanzania and recruiting and training refugees, as well as intimidating and extorting food or money from them. The report suggests that the Tanzanian government could increase police patrols at the border, relocate refugee camps and settlements farther away from the border, and investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for criminal activity.  Each of these proposals would be preferable to the confinement in closed camps thousands of people who have not historically jeopardized Tanzania's safety. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to provide greater financial and logistical support to the Tanzanian government to enable them to adopt alternative security measures that comply with human rights and refugee law.  Human Rights Watch also noted that the 30th anniversary of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Refugee Convention is marked by growing hostility and mistreatment of refugees in the region.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/06/east-timor-stop-militia-violence","East Timor- Stop Militia Violence","East Timor: Stop Militia Violence","","07/06/1999","Human Rights Watch said today that fresh attacks on United Nations personnel by pro-Indonesia militias in East Timor demonstrate that governments supporting the UN mission there need to get much tougher with the Indonesian armed forces. """"Are we going to have to wait for the death of a UN officer for the international community to take action?"""" asked Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. She noted that Australia and the United States had both issued strong statements and conveyed their concerns to the Indonesian government, but said the pressure had to increase. """"We need heads of state, like President Clinton and Prime Minister Obuchi calling Habibie to tell him that his failure to address militia violence is unacceptable. We need suspensions of disbursements of major loans until we see some arrests and prosecutions for these attacks. The Indonesian army is deliberately wrecking the only chance East Timor has for peace, and it's time for tougher tactics."""" Jones noted that representatives of non-governmental organizations have also been the victims of attacks. On Sunday, July 4, members of the Besi Merah Putih militia attacked an NGO convoy that was accompanied by one aid officer of the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), just outside the town of Liquica in East Timor. The name Besi Merah Putih means """"Iron Rod for the Red-and-White,"""" a reference to the Indonesian flag.     In the July 4 attack, Laurentino Soares, a driver for ETADEP, an environmental NGO, was shot in the stomach and remains hospitalized. The UNAMET officer, Patrick Burgess, was directly threatened, and militia members tried to put a gun in his vehicle, apparently to make it look like the UN was carrying arms. The gun was turned over to police. Following the attack, UNAMET decided to evacuate personnel from its Liquica office, and militia members attacked again as the evacuation was taking place.     Six NGO representatives reported missing after the July 4 attack on the NGO convoy were all accounted for by the morning of July 5.     Indonesian officials at both the national and local level have accused the UN of favoring the pro-independence side and have done nothing to curb militia violence. Despite official expressions of """"regret"""" over Sunday's attack and earlier incidents, Indonesian security forces have stood by, or, in some cases, actively participated, as attacks on UN offices have taken place.     The head of the East Timor police, Col. Timbul Silaen, was quoted in the Indonesian newspaper, Waspada, as saying there was a violent clash between NGOs and the Besi Merah Putih militia, as if the NGOs were equally to blame; that the militia members were taking revenge for the death of a BMP member the day before in a shoot-out in Liquica, apparently with pro-independence guerrillas; and that the UN police had no authority to provide protection for NGOs because their role was only to implement the """"popular consultation"""" on East Timor's political status, now scheduled for August. In response to that assertion, Ian Martin, UNAMET head, noted in a press briefing following the incident that it was entirely appropriate for a UN aid officer to be with the NGOs who were bringing relief aid to thousands displaced by the violence. """"It is our responsibility to assess the security situation, and the large numbers of internally displaced people are an important indication of how serious the security situation has been and remains.""""     The deputy police commander for East Timor, Colonel Muafi Sahudji, told reporters on July 6 that UNAMET would have to """"prove"""" its neutrality to the people of Maliana, Liquica, and other areas known as militia strongholds.     Indonesian officials have also failed to investigate threats against human rights defenders. In the most recent such incident, members of a militia based in Maliana threatened the family of East Timor's leading human rights lawyer, Aniceto Gutteres, director of the Hak Foundation, a legal aid bureau based in Dili. Aniceto told Human Rights Watch that on Sunday night, following the attack on the convoy, militia members told his uncle that unless Aniceto was turned over to them by July 10, the house of every member of the extended family would be burned to the ground. Aniceto and his family have been threatened repeatedly since violence escalated in East Timor in April.    Chronology of the July 4 Attack     Given growing attention to the plight of internal refugees displaced by the violence in East Timor, more than a dozen Dili-based NGOs decided to deliver food, medicine, and other supplies to a group of refugees in the towns of Sare and Sailara in Hatolia subdistrict, Ermera in the central part of East Timor. The NGOs in question included ETADEP, the Hak Foundation, the Dili offices of Care International, Oxfam Australia, and Caritas, and several local aid groups. A UNAMET humanitarian aid officer named Patrick Burgess also took part.     According to one of the NGOs present, the group had asked police headquarters in Dili on Friday, July 2, for police protection as far as Sare, fearing that their convoy might be the target of militia attacks. The police refused. The NGOs said they understood that UNAMET could not provide protection for the group because it was outside its mandate.     A convoy of fifteen trucks therefore left at about 11:00 a.m. on Friday without any guards. It reached Sare safely about twelve hours later, and the NGOs representatives planned on distributing supplies the next day. They decided to send the trucks and their drivers back to Dili first, however, as the trucks were rented and the drivers wanted to get home. Accordingly, while the NGOs stayed in Sare, thirteen of the trucks set out for the return journey on Saturday morning. Near the village of Sungai Loes, in Liquica district, the trucks were stopped by troops from the mobile police brigade (Brimob). The drivers were taken to the Liquica police command and questioned about what they were doing, what the purpose of their mission was, and who was in charge. Since they were only hired drivers, they could not answer, so the police ordered them back to Dili to find the persons responsible for the aid mission and have them report to the Liquica command immediately.     Two of the thirteen trucks were commandeered by police to be used to transport army and militia members to the site of an attack earlier that day, apparently by about twenty Falintil guerrillas, in Loidaka village, Liquica. One man named Paulo do Costa, aged forty, described by local officials as an integration supporter and a militia member, was killed, and two other men were seriously wounded.     When the drivers reached Dili, they reported all of this to the Hak Foundation, the premier human rights organization in Dili, and Hak Foundation officials called UNAMET, worried that the team members left behind in Sare might be at risk. According to the NGOs, a UNAMET political officer told them that he would explain the aid mission to the police, although in theory, the NGOs should not be obliged to report their activities.     At about 9:00 p.m. Saturday night, NGO representatives in Dili managed to contact their colleagues in Sare by satellite phone. The Sare group were all safe and had successfully distributed supplies to some 3,600 displaced there. They were planning to return on Sunday and had received a promise of police protection for the return journey. But at about noon on Sunday, part of the NGO team that had gone to Sailara, about twenty minutes away from Sare, reported that the refugees there had received threats from the local militia that they would be attacked on July 6 if they took any aid from the team.     The NGO group, accompanied by Burgess in a UN vehicle, managed to return to Liquica without incident and stopped to report to the district military command. But at an intersection just beyond Liquica, they were suddenly surrounded by BMP members armed with rocks, knives, and rifles. In the attack, the NGO driver was shot, several others in the group were injured, and the UN vehicle was badly damaged.     As Ian Martin, head of UNAMET, told the BBC, """"There were very clear warnings given that militia activity had been building up for some time in Liquica: specific threats to our personnel, which preceded the attack on the humanitarian convoy; requests that there be police protection for the humanitarian convoy itself. And yet it was attacked, not out in the countryside even, but in one of the main towns of East Timor only a short distance from its police station."""" The Besi Merah Putih militia was responsible for what has come to be known as the Liquica massacre last April in which dozens of people were killed. District-level civilian militias, backed by the Indonesian army, suddenly appeared all over East Timor in late 1998 and early 1999 as it seemed that an Indonesian policy shift on East Timor was underway. Since Indonesia's annexation of East Timor in 1976, the Soeharto government had maintained that the territory was an integral part of Indonesia. President Habibie, Soeharto's successor, offered """"wide-ranging autonomy"""" under Indonesian sovereignty in August 1998. On January 27, 1999, he suddenly announced that if the East Timorese rejected that offer, they could consider the """"second option"""" of leaving Indonesian altogether. In an agreement in May 1999, the United Nations was given the role of supervising and conducting a """"popular consultation"""" in which the people of East Timor would decide whether they wanted autonomy under Indonesian rule or separation from Indonesia. That ballot, initially scheduled to be held on August 8, has now been delayed until August 22, 1999.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/07/06/letter-un-secretary-general-kofi-annan-sierra-leone-conflict","Letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Sierra Leone Conflict","Letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Sierra Leone Conflict","","07/06/1999","Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch welcomes the commitment to Sierra Leone shown, most recently, by your decision to visit the country on July 8, and soon after the visit of High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.  As you know, we published a report on Sierra Leone at the time of Mary Robinson's visit, """"Getting Away with Murder, Mutilation and Rape,"""" which detailed gross abuses during the January 1999 occupation of the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, by the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and lesser abuses by the Nigerian-led peacekeeping troops of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). We also wrote to the High Commissioner to draw her attention to the need to ensure that respect for human rights and humanitarian law is built into any peace accord to end the eight-year civil war. We write to you to emphasize the points made in that letter and in our report. Negotiations between the Sierra Leonean government and rebel forces are currently taking place in Lomé, Togo, under the auspices of a facilitation committee chaired by the foreign minister of Togo, with the participation of ECOWAS, the Organization of African Unity, and your special representative, Francis G. Okelo. We are very concerned that these negotiations include the offer of a general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed since the Abidjan Accords of 1996, the last attempt to end the war, which itself included an amnesty. Since 1996, Human Rights Watch and others have documented continuing abuses by all sides in the civil war, and especially gross and systematic abuses by the RUF, including the widespread and indiscriminate murder of civilians; rape; mutilation; abduction of civilians, especially women and children, for purposes of sexual slavery, labor, and training as child combatants; the use of civilians as human shields; and violations of medical neutrality. These abuses constitute grave breaches of the laws of war and crimes against humanity, deemed """"crimes of universal jurisdiction"""" in international law: crimes that are so universally recognized as abhorrent and in the interests of the entire international community to suppress that any nation may prosecute the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, the nationality of victims or of where the crime took place. In your April 1998 report to the Security Council on """"The causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa"""" you stated, in the context of a call to protect civilians in situations of conflict, that: The monitoring and reporting of respect for human rights is a critical responsibility of the international community. Adherence to international humanitarian and human rights norms by all parties to a conflict must be insisted upon, and I intend to make this a priority in the work of the United Nations. In order to make warring parties more accountable for their actions, I recommend that combatants be held financially liable to their victims under international law where civilians are made the deliberate target of aggression. I further recommend that international legal machinery be developed to facilitate efforts to find, attach and seize the assets of transgressing parties and their leaders. You went on to emphasize the needs of children in armed conflict, noting that: Targeting children for attack and recruiting or abducting them into militia forces are terrible crimes that must be specifically addressed in any future war crimes statutes or prosecutions. Human Rights Watch fully supports these statements. In addition, we restate that the international community has an obligation to prosecute crimes of the type that have been committed during the civil war in Sierra Leone. We do not believe that the U.N. should be associated with a peace process that grants impunity for the atrocities committed in the course of the conflict. If any settlement of the conflict in Sierra Leone is to be lasting and just, it must ensure not only that the current parties lay down their weapons, but also that processes are put in place to ensure that the long cycle of impunity and abuse is ended. Peace negotiations under U.N. auspices to end the Angolan civil war included the agreement of six successive amnesties granting impunity for human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law. These amnesties have clearly not contributed to peace: today Angola is back at war. We are aware that it may often seem convenient in the short term to grant amnesty for crimes such as torture, extrajudicial killings, and """"disappearances"""" as a means of inducing rebel leaders to lay down arms. But, as stressed by Human Rights Watch representatives during the May 3 meeting with you, in the long term such impunity breeds contempt for the law and only encourages, rather than deters, similar conduct. The United Nations, as a mediator in peace settlements, has often been confronted with demands to include an amnesty for human rights crimes and has consistently avoided putting its imprimatur on such an outcome. We trust that you will continue this practice. Although a ceasefire has officially been in place between government and rebel forces in Sierra Leone since May 24, 1999, Human Rights Watch has documented serious abuses by the RUF in violation of that ceasefire. It appears that the RUF is continuing with its familiar pattern of attacking civilians during or after raids on villages to obtain food. In Ropolon and Makoba villages near """"Mile 91,"""" on the road from Freetown to Bo, five civilians were hacked to death by rebels on or around June 20. In the Port Loko area one woman was killed and two raped by rebels at Rusar village on June 25. One of these rapes was of a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl by nine men. At Melikuru village rebels killed up to twenty-three civilians on June 23. There are numerous other reports from the same area that RUF rebels have recently carried out killings, amputations, and looting and the destruction of property. If these abuses are continuing even during sensitive peace negotiations, we are not confident that they will cease if a peace accord is reached that does not provide for processes to prevent and punish them. Human Rights Watch believes that the international community, above all the United Nations must emphasize the need for the current negotiations to establish mechanisms to ensure that those who have committed grave abuses will be subject to certain minimum processes of accountability, and that at least those who have committed the worst atrocities, especially those in command positions, are subjected to trial and punishment under national and international laws. We call on you, as secretary-general, to disassociate the U.N. from any peace deal that compromises respect for fundamental standards of human rights and humanitarian law. We also urge you to use your moral authority to speak in favor of accountability. The U.N. should also focus on the positive steps it can take to promote accountability for gross abuses of human rights in Sierra Leone. These steps should include strengthening the Sierra Leonean judicial system and police force and other state institutions necessary to re-establish a rule of law, institutions which are currently weak even in the capital and non-existent in much of the country. Your office should commission a study examining the possibilities for bringing war criminals in Sierra Leone to justice before the courts of other countries or before an international tribunal. For example, the Security Council might establish a dedicated International Criminal Tribunal on Sierra Leone (ICTSL) with the mandate to investigate and sanction those responsible for gross violations of international humanitarian law since the civil war in Sierra Leone began in 1991. In addition to trials for the most serious atrocities, mechanisms of accountability might include the establishment of a """"truth commission"""" to investigate abuses committed by all sides in the civil war, to arrive at findings about those abuses, and to recommend appropriate action against those responsible and steps to be taken to avoid the repetition of similar crimes in future. We welcome the indication given by President Kabbah that he would support the creation of a truth commission. In light of the deep divisions in Sierra Leonean society, Human Rights Watch recommends that a truth commission should include international representation among its commissioners and staff. It is important that such a body emphasize justice as well as reconciliation and have a clear mandate and time table, as well as sufficient resources and legal powers to carry out its work. In your April 1998 report you stated, in the context of a discussion of post-conflict peace-building, that: an integrated peace-building effort is needed to address the various factors that have caused or are threatening a conflict. Peace-building may involve the creation or strengthening of national institutions, monitoring elections, promoting human rights, providing for integration and rehabilitation programmes, and creating conditions for resumed development. ... [E]mphasis must be placed on critical priorities such as encouraging reconciliation and demonstrating respect for human rights; fostering political inclusiveness and promoting national unity; ensuring the safe, smooth and early repatriation and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons; reintegrating ex-combatants and others into productive society; curtailing the availability of small arms; and mobilizing the domestic and international resources for reconstruction and economic recovery. All of these priorities apply to Sierra Leone, and we urge you to use your best efforts to ensure that the U.N. and its member states do not disappoint the expectations of Sierra Leone's people that the international community will come to their assistance in support of these goals. The Nigerian-led forces of ECOMOG have carried the heaviest burden in international efforts to resolve the conflict in Sierra Leone. While they have also been guilty of abuses, it is undoubtedly the case that their presence has prevented other atrocities by rebel forces. Nigeria has paid a high price for its intervention in money and lives. There is strong pressure on Nigeria's new head of state, President Olusegun Obasanjo, to bring the Nigerian troops home. We suggest you use the opportunity of your visit to Sierra Leone and Nigeria to call for greater international support for the ECOMOG peacekeeping effort, while also insisting on the need for those forces to respect international humanitarian law to its full extent, and taking steps to ensure proper coordination of the ECOMOG effort with the U.N. in line with the recommendations of your 1998 report. The international community must not apply double standards to Africa and Europe. As we stated in our letter to High Commissioner Robinson, the abuses committed in Sierra Leone equal those in the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo. World leaders must show an equal commitment to bringing to justice war criminals in Africa as they have recently begun to do in the Balkans.

In one instance, twelve Hindu laborers were killed, apparently by Muslim militants, on June 29. On June 28, seventeen members of three families of suspected militants were killed, reportedly by militia forces working with Indian security forces. Human Rights Watch condemned the killings and called on the international community to put pressure on India and Pakistan-backed militants to end the abuses.  """"The international community is treating Kashmir as though it were a political crisis that emerged from nowhere,""""said Patricia Gossman, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"By ignoring the human rights dimension of the conflict, international diplomacy to end the fighting in Kashmir is bound to fail."""" Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Security Council to call on both India and Pakistan not just to step back from the Line of Control but to end their abusive practices on the ground and allow U.N. human rights investigators full access to the region. In addition, the U.S., Japan and other major investors and donors should make loans to Pakistan contingent on its cutting its support for the militants. Similar pressure should be placed on India to curb the killings and torture, including criminal prosecutions of soldiers who have murdered and raped, and officials who have ordered the killing of human rights activists. The killings represent only the latest of the atrocities that have characterized the decade-long conflict in Kashmir. In their effort to curb support for pro-independence militants, Indian security forces have resorted to extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" torture, and rape. Widespread arbitrary arrests and collective punishments have further alienated many Kashmiris.  At the same time, militant groups have massacred Hindu civilians and have kidnapped and killed civil servants and suspected informers. These actions, together with the fact that many of the militants are crossing into India from Pakistan, have raised fears that tensions in the region could erupt into full-scale war.  Human Rights Watch said that India must end its practice of """"disappearing,"""" torturing and murdering suspected militants, while Islamabad must withdraw its support from militant groups who are terrorizing towns and villages on the Indian side of the border.  On the night of June 29, suspected militants entered a factory in Anantnag district, south of the capital, Srinagar, and shot dead twelve Hindu construction workers as they slept. The victims were migrant laborers from the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The killings coincided with the visit of India's Home Minister, L. K. Advani, who arrived in Srinagar Wednesday for a briefing on India's offensive against militant forces occupying strategic sites on the Indian side of the Line of Control near Kargil.  The killings may have been carried out in retaliation for the June 28 killings of seventeen members of three families, including five women and seven children, in the Surankote area of Punch. A woman who was critically injured was hospitalized. The gunmen entered the houses during the night and shot the victims as they slept. Explosions rocked the houses of the victims following the killings. Blaming the security forces, local villagers set up road blockades to protest the killings.

The donors should also press the Indonesian government to prosecute militia leaders responsible for attacks on U.N. offices to the fullest extent of the law. Human Rights Watch also called on multilateral financial institutions to suspend any further disbursements of aid to Indonesia until the Habibie government takes more serious moves than it has thus far to curb militia violence. It noted that the civilian militias in East Timor have operated since their inception with the backing of the Indonesian military. """"These attacks are jeopardizing the whole U.N. mission in East Timor,""""said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The question is whether donors are going to wring their hands quietly or read the riot act to Habibie.""""  On June 29, members of a pro-Indonesia militia in Maliana, west of Dili, threw rocks at the U.N. office there, injuring twelve East Timorese and a South African woman working as a U.N. district electoral official. There had been a clash the night before between militia members and independence supporters. Most of the injuries suffered were minor; one of the East Timorese reportedly had his arm broken. Two U.N. vehicles and several nearby houses were also attacked. Local police made no effort to disperse the attackers, and there were reports of Indonesian army personnel among the militia members. On June 30, militia members armed with rifles, spears, and other weapons, some of them masked, threatened U.N. staff members in Viqueque, a district east of the capital, with death if they didn't vacate the premises. Several of the U.N. staff were evacuated to Dili as a result. These were only the latest in a series of violent incidents involving army-backed militias in East Timor. Jones acknowledged that pro-independence groups have also been responsible for some violence but said the militia attacks were more frequent, more organized, and supported by the state, through the involvement of Indonesian army and police.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","United Nations, World Bank, IMF"

Baldo said that activists who are forced to flee the Congo unfortunately encounter increasing risks in neighboring countries. He called on governments throughout the region and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide safe asylum for them."""" In response to a denunciation of government abuses by Voice of the Voiceless, Congolese government agents have cracked down on this leading monitoring group, ransacking its offices on June 25 and forcing its leadership to go into hiding to escape imminent arrest and abuse.  On May 29, the police arrested Laurent Kantu Lumpungu, chairman of the Association of Prison Officials, while he was visiting the capital's central prison and took him to the police station where he was abused. He continues to be arbitrarily detained at the same prison he was inspecting on behalf of his organization.  The rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy has also cracked down on activists in areas it controls. Groupe Jérémie, an independent monitoring and civic education group based in Bukavu, recently criticized the deterioration of educational and other social services following the rebels' takeover of the region. On June 15, 1999, rebel soldiers broke into and ransacked its offices, confiscating all the records of the organization. The next day, the governor of south Kivu accused the organization in a radio broadcast of distributing subversive leaflets to the population, an act which he equated with treason. The organization called on the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy and the Kabila government to end all forms of harassment and intimidation aimed at human rights defenders and their organizations, and to release the activists who have been arbitrarily detained.  Human Rights Watch expressed grave concerns about the security of Congolese asylum seekers throughout the region, and called on the concerned host governments and the UNHCR to provide safe asylum for those forced into exile. The organization urged the Ugandan government to investigate the disappearance of Medi Djuma-Bihira, a Congolese activist who went missing on June 16, and to put in place measures to guarantee the security of asylum seekers and refugees in Uganda. Human Rights Watch urged the UNHCR to make the protection of those most at risk, including human rights activists who face persecution at home, a key priority.

In May 1999 the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), unhappy with a ruling by the Court of Final Appeal, the region's highest court, over who from mainland China was eligible to settle in Hong Kong, asked the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) in China to review the ruling. The Standing Committee overturned the court's decision on June 26.   The threat to Hong Kong's judicial autonomy in this case comes less from the action of the NPC than from the political precedent set by the Hong Kong government and its chief executive, Tung Chee-Hwa, in turning to the NPC for an effective reversal of a court ruling it did not like. Members of Congress and the U.S. administration should raise their concerns with Mr. Tung and indicate that the implications of his actions go far beyond the """"right of abode"""" question to the central question of whether Hong Kong's much-praised courts will retain any independence at all.   Background   Under the Joint Declaration, the document hammered out by Britain and China that transferred Hong Kong to China, and the Basic Law, which serves as the constitution of the HKSAR, Hong Kong's autonomy was to be protected primarily through a legal and judicial system separate from that of China. One of the most controversial aspects of the Basic Law was the provision that the National People's Congress would have the final say over the law's interpretation, meaning that legally, the NPC could indeed challenge rulings by the Court of Final Appeal. Hong Kong's legal community and pro-democracy activists clearly recognized the danger this provision posed, but it was not clear how or under what circumstances the NPC would choose to invoke its authority. Few suspected that the danger would come from the Hong Kong government's inviting the NPC to intervene.   Yet this is exactly what happened with the right of abode controversy. The Basic Law stipulates that persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong to parents who have permanent residency in the HKSAR would themselves be eligible for right of abode. Immediately following the transfer of sovereignty, a number of children and parents petitioned the Hong Kong government for recognition of this right. The Provisional Legislature, appointed by the Chinese government, passed a law, effective retroactively, to restrict this right. On January 29, 1999, the Court of Final Appeal issued a decision that gave the right of abode to a broader group of people than the HKSAR government chose to recognize. These included:  Children born out of wedlock whose mothers do not have the right of abode in Hong Kong but whose fathers do.  Children whose parents did not have the right of abode in Hong Kong at the time of their birth but who subsequently acquired that right.  The Hong Kong government expressed concerns about the number of people who could be eligible for entry into Hong Kong over the next ten years if the CFA's broader interpretation of the right of abode was allowed to stand. It also professed concern about the impact this influx would have on Hong Kong's social stability. It argued that Hong Kong did not have the resources to meet the housing, education, medical and health, and social welfare needs of the newcomers, although the numbers it used to make the argument were ludicrously overstated in the view of many legal scholars and social scientists.   After Chinese government officials objected to the CFA ruling, and after the CFA's Chief Justice was forced to issue an unprecedented """"clarification"""" of the ruling, Tung Chee-Hwa decided to seek an interpretation by the NPC's Standing Committee as a way of avoiding implementation of the court's decision. Turning to China to resolve a critically important legal dispute was not the only option open to the Hong Kong government, but it was by far the worst. It could have allowed the CFA decision to stand and then waited to see if the numbers of Chinese seeking right of abode bore any resemblance to its apocalyptic predictions. It could have sought a new ruling from the CFA through new cases. Even working through the SAR Legislative Council to seek an amendment to the Basic Law would have been preferable than inviting Chinese intervention in Hong Kong judicial matters.   By turning to the NPC to bolster its own case, the Hong Kong government has set a dangerous precedent, effectively giving notice that any time the Court of Final Appeal rules in a way that the executive branch of the SAR finds objectionable, it will turn to China for assistance. This makes a mockery both of the notion of checks and balances within the SAR government as well as of Hong Kong autonomy itself.   The NPC Standing Committee responded predictably to the HKSAR government's request for interpretation. In its decision adopted last week, it said the Court of Final Appeal should have itself asked the NPCSC for an interpretation of the controversial part of the Basic Law before it gave its final ruling. It also stated that the CFA's interpretation was in violation of the spirit of the Basic Law. It upheld the Hong Kong government's restrictive interpretation of the right of abode of mainland children, limiting it to those, who at the time of their birth, had at least one parent who was already a permanent Hong Kong resident. Anyone else would have to seek permission from relevant departments in the Chinese government and there was no guarantee that permission would be granted. This interpretation applies to relevant future cases handled by Hong Kong courts but does not affect those who have already obtained the right of abode as a result of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal's initial ruling in January 1999.   The key issue from a human rights perspective is not the right of abode per se. It is the independence of the Hong Kong courts. This precedent has the potential of opening a wide swathe of judicial rulings to attack and """"reinterpretation,"""" particularly those that displease either the Chief Executive in Hong Kong or the government in Beijing.   Human Rights Watch urges the Administration and Congress to raise concerns, privately and publicly, with Hong Kong and Beijing officials about threats to the rule of law and the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary. For example, this issue should be on the agenda of President Clinton's talks with Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa at the APEC summit in New Zealand in September. Members of the business community should also continue to speak out, recognizing the importance of Hong Kong's legal system to its prosperity and economic vitality.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/06/29/letter-us-president-clinton-sierra-leone-conflict","Letter to US President Clinton on the Sierra Leone Conflict","Letter to U.S. President Clinton on the Sierra Leone Conflict","","06/29/1999","Dear President Clinton,   Sierra Leone has seen some of the worst violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the world during its terrible eight-year civil war. While it is impossible to give accurate figures for the number of casualties, perhaps 50,000 people have died and up to [half] the population of 4.5 million is displaced, of which an estimated 480,000 are refugees who have crossed international borders into Guinea and Liberia. Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of amputation in the world - though it is not a country with a serious landmine problem.   The rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have systematically murdered, mutilated, and raped civilians throughout their campaign. According to a recent report by Human Rights Watch, during their January 1999 occupation of the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, the RUF killed thousands of civilians, committing scores of massacres of civilians hiding in houses, churches, or mosques; amputated the limbs of hundreds of persons, including a number of young children; and systematically rounded up girls and women, particularly those deemed to be virgins and took them to rebel command centers, where they were raped individually or in groups. From witness accounts, it seems that the rebels have special """"amputation"""" and """"execution"""" units which specialize in these particular types of abuses. As the rebels withdrew from the capital, they abducted others, including children who were immediately put in training to become soldiers themselves. They set entire neighborhoods on fire, leaving up to 80 percent of some areas in ashes and an estimated 51,000 civilians in the capital homeless. The Nigerian-led peacekeeping forces of Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) also committed serious abuses during the January offensive, including summary executions of at least 180 suspected rebels or collaborators, but these abuses were at a lower level than the crimes committed by the RUF.   While the plight of civilians and the scale of atrocities committed in Sierra Leone is similar to the situation in Kosovo and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, the contrast in terms of international response is striking. Although some governments, including the United Kingdom, United States, the Netherlands, and Canada have made significant contributions to the Sierra Leonean crisis, other West African countries, in particular Nigeria, the primary country contributing forces to ECOMOG, and Guinea, which has received the largest number of refugees, have borne the greatest cost from Sierra Leone's civil war - apart from the citizens of Sierra Leone itself.   No Western power has committed serious resources to assisting those who have fled into neighboring Guinea and Liberia to escape the atrocities. Earlier this year, UNHCR launched an emergency appeal for $8 million for Sierra Leone refugees. By early June, the agency had received only $1.3 million. But in Kosovo, UNHCR has spent an estimated $10 million a week since the latest crisis started. When Serb forces began lobbing shells into Albanian villages, aid groups rapidly mobilized to move refugee camps further from the border. Meanwhile, dozens of Sierra Leoneans have already died in rebel attacks on their camps in Guinea, some of which are less than a mile away from the border.   The disparity between the international response to Kosovo and Sierra Leone exists not only in the area of refugee protection and humanitarian assistance. While the United States has sent more than fifty FBI investigators to Kosovo to gather evidence of war crimes, it has expressed little interest in bringing the perpetrators of similar crimes in Sierra Leone to justice. The United States has recognized its failure to intervene in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and has pledged """"never again"""" to stand by in the face of such massive atrocities. In Sierra Leone, the fundamental guarantees of humanitarian law have been grossly and systematically violated, as in the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda, yet the U.S. response demonstrates that African problems still receive inadequate attention.   An international intervention on the scale of a NATO bombing campaign would not be necessary to address the human rights crisis in Sierra Leone. What is needed is diplomatic and economic pressure, consistently applied. The current peace negotiations taking place in Lomé, Togo, offer some hope that the country's long nightmare may at last be coming to a close. U.S. support for this process can help to ensure that the temporary ceasefire currently in place becomes a long-lasting peace.   In particular, the U.S. should emphasize that any peace process in Sierra Leone must include mechanisms of accountability if it is to bring long term peace and stability to the country. Conflict in Sierra Leone has been built on a cycle of impunity that goes back almost to independence: members of all parties to the current war have benefited from this impunity. It is necessary for the future peace of the country that at least those who have committed the worst atrocities, especially those in command positions, are not rewarded with general amnesties and uncritical inclusion in government structures that are supposed to re-establish respect for human rights and the rule of law. Rather, they should face trials respecting the full extent of national and international law. The citizens of Rwanda and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia have learnt this lesson only too painfully over the last years - and the people of Sierra Leone can also look back over their own history and see the terrible consequences of repeated access to power by those who have committed gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law and never faced any consequences for their actions. In light of the fact that the Sierra Leonean judicial system and police force are weak even in the capital and non-existent in much of the country, the U.S. should focus, with other international actors, especially on strengthening these and other state institutions necessary to re-establish a rule of law. This is not an impossible task, if there is serious international commitment to seeing it achieved.   In addition to trials for the most serious atrocities, mechanisms of accountability might include the establishment of a """"truth commission"""" to investigate abuses committed by all sides in the civil war, to arrive at findings about those abuses, and to recommend appropriate action against those responsible and steps to be taken to avoid the repetition of similar crimes in future. President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone has indicated that he would support the creation of a truth commission. It is important that such a body emphasize justice as well as reconciliation.   Other key issues that must be addressed in any peace process are:  The revival and strengthening of the program for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants (the DDR program), especially in relation to child soldiers who were originally abducted. The development of concrete plans for meeting the long-term needs of those who were adversely affected by the war, including the thousands of victims of limb amputation and mutilation, sexually abused women, and children who have been victims of atrocities, have witnessed atrocities (sometimes against their own parents) or have themselves taken part in atrocities. The voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced to their homes under conditions which guarantee full respect for the human rights, safety, security and dignity of all. The substantial reinforcement of the human rights monitoring capacity of UNOMSIL, the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, by increasing the numbers of monitors deployed in the country so that both urban and rural areas can be monitored, and by clarifying lines of reporting within the U.N. The establishment of sustainable processes to build respect for human rights and the rule of law in Sierra Leone in the long term, including strengthening local institutions for the protection of human rights, such as the judiciary, a national human rights commission, and nongovernmental human rights groups, as well as creating security forces that are respectful of human rights and carrying out programs of human rights education.

With a verdict expected today in the trial of Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), Human Rights Watch noted that the considerable latitude given for the defendant to speak in his own defense was not typical of the Turkish state security courts, where defendants' rights are restricted—particularly in the initial stages of proceedings. """"There was an element of political theater in this trial,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"The court devoted a lot of time to presenting the PKK as a creation of Turkey's foreign enemies. But it neglected to uncover the chain of command between Ocalan and the crimes committed by PKK members."""" The Turkish government made considerable efforts to convince the world that this would be a fair trial - even enacting a change to the constitution last week to replace the court's military judge with a civilian one. Human Rights Watch welcomed the removal of the military judge from State Security Court benches, but restated its view expressed at the outset of the trial that there were other serious problems with the independence of the judiciary in Turkey. Sugden said that almost every day, in Istanbul, Ankara or Diyarbakir State Security Court, defendants report to the bench that they were subjected to ill-treatment or torture in police custody. In many cases, their allegations are supported by medical evidence. Human Rights Watch was satisfied that Abdullah Ocalan was not subjected to torture in police custody, but the irregularities which occurred in the first days of custody prejudiced the defendant's right of defense and tainted subsequent proceedings. """"It was in the first days after arrest that things started to go wrong,"""" said Sugden. When Ocalan was brought to Turkey after his abduction from Kenya in February, he was held in incommunicado police detention for nine days - far in excess of international standards, and even of the limits imposed by Turkish domestic law. Sugden therefore disagreed with observers from the Council of Europe, who said on June 21 that """"the trial . . . has been correct and in accordance with the applicable Turkish law."""" Meanwhile, Ocalan has been permitted only limited access to legal counsel. During meetings with his lawyers, which were restricted in frequency and duration, one or more security force members was present and within hearing. During the initial stage of the investigation, lawyers were not permitted to bring notes to interviews with their client. Sugden noted also that once the process reached the courts, there were other reminders of common State Security Court practice: the judges refused to hear any of the witnesses proposed by the defense, and barred at least one piece of their evidence from being read to the court on the grounds that it was """"propaganda"""".  """"The shortcomings in Ocalan's trial would have been grave in any legal proceedings,"""" said Sugden. """"But they were quite unacceptable when a human being is on trial for his life."""" Ocalan is being tried under Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which carries a mandatory death sentence. Sugden urged the Council of Europe to defend its goal of making Europe a death-penalty-free zone.  Turkey has never executed a prisoner sentenced by a State Security Court, and has sustained a de facto moratorium on executions for 15 years. Human Rights Watch urged Turkish politicians to hold to their principled position on the death penalty. There are currently forty-two people on death row who have exhausted all legal avenues. Human Rights Watch noted that Ocalan was not directly charged with any of the hundreds of PKK killings of unarmed Kurdish villagers, teachers or prisoners, but rather with a 'crime against the state.' """"Leaders should be held to account, however, when their subordinates kill civilians or prisoners—clear violations of international humanitarian law,"""" said Sugden. """"Milosevic and Pinochet may stand trial for such crimes -- and Ocalan should, too.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Leftist guerrillas carry out mass kidnappings in Colombia.  Democracy in the region As the millennium draws near, multi-party democracies appear stable throughout most of Latin America and the Caribbean, with the notable exception of Cuba, where the government of Fidel Castro celebrated its fortieth anniversary in power on January 1, 1999, with no sign of a significant political opening on the horizon. On March 1, the government conducted a closed trial for four prominent dissidents imprisoned since July 1997. Meanwhile, the anti-democratic tendencies of Peru's President Alberto Fujimori have become ever more pronounced as he maneuvers to seek an unprecedented third term in office, despite a constitutional limit of two consecutive terms for any president. Widespread harassment and intimidation of opposition journalists in 1998 and 1999 has been attributed to the national intelligence service, whose de facto head, Vladimiro Montesinos, is a close advisor to President Fujimori.  Chile's willingness to use antiquated desacato (contempt for authority) laws to repress speech embarrassing to high-level military and civilian officials became glaringly apparent in April 1999 when a judge impounded all available copies of the newly published Black Book of Chilean Justice, by journalist Alejandra Matus. Matus left the country before being prosecuted under Chile's forty-year-old National Security Law, which provides special protection to government and military officials from offenses. However, on June 16, the manager and editor of Planeta, the publishing house that released the book, were arrested.  Violations of the laws of war in internal armed conflicts  The internal armed conflicts that only a few years ago engulfed countries including El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Peru have all but ended, with the notable exception of Colombia, which alone in the region remains awash in political violence as all parties to that country's internal armed conflict commit egregious violations of the laws of war.  The greatest portion of atrocities in Colombia have been attributed to paramilitary groups, which continue in many instances to receive support from the armed forces. When not directly participating in paramilitary massacres, government security forces have done nothing to protect the population from them. The government has taken some steps towards purging the military of known human rights abusers. On April 9, President Pastrana cashiered Generals Rito Alejo del Río and Fernando Millán , the highest-level army officers ever fired for alleged human rights violations. The Attorney General's Office is pursuing a case against Del Río for alleged support for paramilitary violence. A similar case against Millán remains before a military tribunal and will likely end in impunity. Colombia's military courts are notoriously lenient in judging members of the armed forces accused of human rights violations.  In May, the Attorney General's Office suspended Gen. Jaime Humberto Uscátegui, commander of the second army division, from active service, for failing to prevent a massacre in the village of Mapiripán, Meta, in 1997. Unfortunately, his case has also been referred to a military court, leaving little chance for successful prosecution.  Meanwhile Colombian guerrillas continue to systematically violate the laws of war. In February 1999, militants of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) seized, then executed three U.S. citizens who had visited the U'wa indigenous group in Northeastern Colombia.  Another Colombian guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ELN), committed a series of mass kidnappings in 1999. ELN leader Antonio García defended kidnapping as a """"taxation policy"""" in press interviews and said the group would continue the practice. On April 12, the ELN seized forty-one passengers and crew members of an Avianca airline flight. A month later, over 140 worshipers at a Cali church were taken.  In Peru, Shining Path forces continued to use vicious methods against civilians. On May 28, 1999, some thirty members of the group entered the town of Uchiza, in the department of Huallaga, in four vehicles. During a frustrated bank robbery the group opened fire on civilians, killing trade unionist Jesús Espinoza León, and two schoolchildren, as well as a policeman.  Accountability for past human rights violations  Guatemala, at peace since 1996, witnessed publication of the most comprehensive study yet of the massive human rights violations that accompanied its thirty-year armed struggle. The March 1999 report of the U.N.-sponsored truth commission found state forces and paramilitary groups responsible for 93 percent of the human rights violations it documented. Eighty-three percent of the victims of arbitrary execution or disappearance were Mayans, leading to the conclusion that the state was responsible for acts of genocide.  On May 20, Human Rights Watch and three other human rights organizations released a document smuggled out of Guatemalan military files that revealed the fate of more than 180 individuals """"disappeared"""" by Guatemalan security forces between August 1983 and March 1985. Most of the individuals listed in the logbook were apparently murdered, several were turned over to military bases to act as informers, and a few escaped or were freed. The document constituted the first evidence of its kind to come from within military files.  Like its neighbors, Guatemala's peace has remained uneasy, as soaring rates of common crime replace political violence as the greatest threat to public security. In Guatemala as in the region's other transitions from political violence, impunity remains the Achilles' heel of the peace process. Violent crimes remain unpunished, and the shocking assassination of Bishop Juan José Gerardi in April 1998 show the limits of a peace process that failed to establish accountability for egregious human rights violations. Additional acts of violence and intimidation in 1999—including the assassination in Guatemala City of opposition politician Roberto Belarmino González in May and threats to other members of his party—suggest a worsening situation.  In Chile, the Senate is currently discussing a measure that would further impunity for gross human rights violations, in the purported interest of establishing the fate of those disappeared during Chile's seventeen-year military dictatorship (1973-1990). The Senate bill would offer complete anonymity to anyone implicated in human rights violations who provides information that would clarify the fate of disappeared individuals. Combined with the amnesty law enacted by the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in 1978, this new measure would reduce even further the narrow possibilities for establishing accountability for the egregious human rights violations practiced by the military government. In addition, it would be unlikely to prove useful in the discovery of human remains, as Chile's Truth and Reconciliation Commission established that many victims' bodies were thrown into the sea or destroyed by explosives. Passage of this measure would be a serious setback to efforts to establish truth and justice regarding thousands of """"disappearances"""" from the time of the dictatorship.  Human rights violations as crime control  Impunity for powerful, violent criminals, a yawning gap between rich and poor, and corrupt and ineffective police and judiciaries have conspired to leave many Latin American and Caribbean nations victim to seemingly uncontrollable crime. The inability of police and courts across the continent to control common crime by legal means have produced serious setbacks in human rights. Amid intense public pressure for crime control, several governments have made the rights of defendants a scapegoat for the failure of law enforcement, making irresponsible public statements that seemed to justify or even invite police brutality. Some governments went so far as to enact legislation to curtail defendants' rights in criminal proceedings.  Mexico and Peru in 1998 developed legislation that chipped away at due process rights of individuals suspected of common crimes. Arguing that human rights guarantees constituted a strait jacket in the fight against increasingly sophisticated crimes, President Ernesto Zedillo sent new anti-crime proposals to the Congress that would facilitate detentions based on slim evidence — a serious problem in a country noted for illegal arrests, fabrication of evidence, and a barely functioning system of public defenders.  More drastic measures were taken by Peru's President Alberto Fujimori in 1998. Following an upsurge in violent crime in Lima, the Congress gave Fujimori decree-making authority on national security matters for fifteen days. The president issued a number of decrees that severely eroded basic due process guarantees for common crime suspects and reproduced some of the worst features of the now-defunct faceless court system that had been used to try terrorist suspects. Under the new system, those accused of gang-related activities could be detained without charge for up to fifteen days and under no conditions could be released before trial. Those accused—including minors between the ages of sixteen and eighteen—are subject to trial by military courts. Other decrees drastically reduced the effectiveness of habeas corpus against arbitrary arrest.  Meanwhile President Fujimori has abruptly stopped processing pardon recommendations presented to him by the government's own Ad Hoc Commission, set up in 1996 to review the cases of innocent prisoners convicted by the so-called faceless anti-terrorist courts. Established by decree in 1992, the faceless courts sent thousands of terrorism suspects to serve lengthy prison sentences based on trials that violated the most fundamental due process rights. After accusing the Ad Hoc Commission, whose three members include Fujimori's minister of justice, of presenting to him as innocents cases of genuine terrorists, the president in February ceased granting pardons to cases brought before him by the commission. President Fujimori has rejected outright thirty-five cases presented to him by the respected commission, and the cases of an estimated 200 imprisoned individuals deemed innocent by human rights groups are now bottled up.  Police brutality remains notorious in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In São Paulo, military police forced three youths aged fourteen, seventeen, and twenty-one into a squad car in the dawn hours of February 17, 1999, the morning ending Carnival. The detention and subsequent """"disappearance"""" of the youths provoked outrage and reaction from authorities largely because none of the three had criminal records and were all from relatively affluent families. On April 2, their bodies were discovered in a nearby wooded area, each bearing the marks of a single well-placed shot to the head.  Prison conditions  Conditions of detention remain horrendous in much of Brazil, Venezuela, and Central America. Throughout the region, the practice of holding detainees in pretrial detention creates situations in which the vast majority of the prison population is unsentenced, usually sharing overcrowded cells with convicted criminals. In Venezuela, prisons are severely overcrowded, understaffed, and, above all, violent. In police lockups in Minas Gerais, Brazil, where more than 80% of the prison population is held for months or years in small cells designed for short term detention, torture has been routinely applied, including such methods as electric shock and near-drowning. Meanwhile severe overcrowding, official violence, and appalling conditions continue to provoke rebellions in Brazil's prisons, jails, and police holding centers, some of them ending in extrajudicial executions of escaped prisoners by police.  In a positive development, Peru's Congress in February 1998 passed a law specifically outlawing torture, providing appropriate penalties, and ensuring that military and police officers accused will be tried in civilian courts. Nonetheless, the practice of torture has continued. A case being investigated under the law was that of Pablo Pascual Espinoza Lomé, who was beaten to death on January 18, 1999, at the Yanamilla Prison in Ayacucho by a prison guard after he was discovered to have drank an alcoholic beverage made of corn (""""chicha""""). His spleen was ruptured and he suffered an internal hemorrhage. Persecution of Human Rights Defenders  Colombia stands out in the region for its shocking record of assassination of human rights defenders, at a time when such crimes have become more unusual throughout the hemisphere. During 1998, six human rights defenders were murdered, among them government officials investigating human rights abuses as well as nongovernmental defenders.  On January 28, 1999, four members of the Medellín-based Popular Training Institute (Instituto Popular de Capacitación, IPC), were kidnaped by hired gunmen acting for paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño. The victims were Jairo Bedoya, Claudia Tamayo, Jorge Salazar, and Olga Rodas. Castaño released the four defenders in February; however, his forces subsequently abducted Sen. Piedad Córdoba, a vocal supporter of human rights, for a brief period in May.  The following Saturday, two human rights workers were hauled off a bus in Medellín and shot dead. Everardo De Jesús Puerta and Julio Ernesto González worked for the Committee to Support Political Prisoners (Comité de Solidaridad con Presos Políticos, CSPP) and were headed for their annual planning meeting.  Guatemala has yet to make progress in solving the shocking murder in April 1998 of Bishop Juan José Gerardi, who was bludgeoned to death days after the church human rights office he directed issued a four-volume study of atrocities by all sides in Guatemala's three decades of internal armed conflict. The government's shoddy investigation into the case brought into serious question its ability to make a break with the nation's tradition of granting impunity to human rights violators. Days before the first anniversary of Gerardi's assassination, armed men raided the home of Ronalth Ochaeta, staff director of the Human Rights Office of the Archbishop of Guatemala.  President Alvaro Arzú only made matters worse in June when he used the occasion of his opening speech to the meeting in Guatemala of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States to denounce non-governmental organizations as """"sly instruments of foreign policy"""" and """"small groups of self-styled spokespeople, whose representativeness is debatable..."""" This kind of statement is reminiscent of those repeatedly uttered in the past by Guatemalan military leaders seeking to distract attention from human rights violations.  On March 1, 1999, Cuban authorities convicted four leaders of the Internal Dissidents' Working Group on charges against the security of the state emanating from their pleas for release of political prisoners. The four dissidents—Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello, Vladimiro Roca Antúnez, Félix Antonio Bonne Carcasses, and René Gómez Manzano—had been in pretrial detention in maximum security prisons since their July 16, 1997 arrests.  On a positive note, following information provided by Human Rights Watch, federal authorities located the murder weapon used to kill Brazilian human rights lawyer Gilson Nogueira on October 20, 1996 in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte. The police found the weapon during a search of property belonging to one of the principal suspects, who has since been arrested. Nogueira had been actively investigating a death involving police and employees of the state public security secretariat and had received numerous death threats prior to his assassination.  The role of the international community  Spain and the United Kingdom made historic strides towards establishing accountability for crimes against humanity in October 1998, when British police arrested former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte in London. Spanish judge Baltazar Garzón asked that Pinochet be detained for the presumed murder of dozens of Spanish and Chilean citizens during the seventeen years in which Pinochet and the military governed Chile, a time of widespread and egregious violations of the right to life, liberty, and physical integrity, including some 3,000 assassinations or """"disappearances."""" Pinochet's detention was an important victory for the rule of law, suggesting that tyrants could no longer terrorize their own populations, secure in the knowledge that at worst they would face a tranquil exile. In March 1999 a House of Lords appellate panel ruled that Pinochet could be extradited for torture committed after December 8, 1988, the date that the Convention Against Torture entered force in the three countries concerned. The extradition of a former head of state for torture is unprecedented and will set a milestone in international accountability.  The United States policy of unrelenting confrontation towards Cuba came under increasing attack from all corners of the globe. By a record margin, the United Nations General Assembly in October 1998 approved a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to the nearly forty-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, with only the U.S. and Israel objecting.  European policy towards Cuba has rested on firm human rights principles without resorting to such a blunt instrument as the U.S. embargo, which the E.U. is on record opposing. Yet the E.U., whose members have become important investors in Cuba, has been unable to translate a principled policy into human rights gains on the island. Canada's constructive engagement policy has been similarly unproductive.","Americas","Arms, Free Speech, Detention Centers"

The organization sent letters Thursday to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and Colombian President Andrés Pastrana urging them to ensure that future Colombian refugees be allowed to remain in Venezuela until their claims are thoroughly reviewed. """"Families have been intimidated into returning to Colombia despite a well-founded fear of paramilitary attacks."""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This flies in the face of Colombia and Venezuela's legal obligation to protect refugees."""" On May 29, forces under the command of Carlos Castaño, leader of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC), entered the Catatumbo region of Colombia, detaining and killing people whose names appeared on their lists. Colombia's Public Advocate reported that paramilitaries at a single roadblock killed at least twenty people and abducted up to fifteen more. As attacks continued, over 600 refugees—most of them women and children—left the village of La Pista for Venezuela. According to international observers in Venezuela, more than 100 said they feared for their lives and wished to apply for refugee status. Instead, the government of Venezuela transferred them to a National Guard barracks, denying them access to representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian groups. The UNHCR was also barred from a June 11 meeting between Venezuelan and Colombian authorities, who apparently agreed to repatriate the refugees and ignore their asylum claims. Also on June 11, Venezuelan authorities allowed the Colombian army colonel in charge of the Catatumbo region to speak to the refugees. Witnesses reported that the officer spoke in an intimidating way, suggesting that anyone who did not return or reported collaboration between the army and paramilitaries would be considered a guerrilla supporter. The families were returned to Colombia despite the continuing paramilitary offensive in the region. """"A policy of intimidating or forcing refugees to return to Colombia without first guaranteeing their security can have devastating consequences,"""" said Vivanco. He cited the 1997 case of the forced return of 300 Colombian refugees from Panamá. Several of the refugees later appeared on death lists and at least one was murdered. Both Colombia and Venezuela signed the United Nations Convention on Refugees and its later Protocol, which prohibit the refoulement, or forced return, of refugees. The Convention also obligates its signatories to cooperate fully with the UNHCR to assist refugees and ensure their well-being and safety.","Americas, Colombia, Venezuela","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

According to Ardzinov, 63, whom Human Rights Watch interviewed soon after his release from custody, the police held him for nearly fourteen hours. They reportedly beat and kicked him throughout. A U.S. Embassy medical officer who examined him after his release confirmed that he had suffered two broken ribs, a cut nose, contusions to his kidneys, and a concussion. During the interrogation, in which Ardzinov was refused access to medical care and to legal counsel, police brought Ardzinov before a panel of three psychiatrists, threatening him with psychiatric detention. The district prosecutor ordered Ardzinov to appear for further questioning the following day. However, under advice from the U.S. Embassy doctor Ardzinov has remained at home to recuperate from his injuries. Human Rights Watch believes that Mikhail Ardzinov is in danger of further mistreatment by the police if he is again brought in for questioning. """"This outrage is a warning to all of Uzbekistan's human rights defenders"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"President Karimov wants no witnesses to the mass arbitrary arrests and political trials underway in the country."""" Mr. Ardzinov told Human Rights Watch that at approximately 9:30 am on June 25, three plainclothes officers seized him on the street and brought him by car to his apartment, beating him in the chest, ribs, and kidneys on the way. Another six plainclothes officers and two witnesses were waiting at his home. With them was a uniformed investigator from the Tashkent City Police Department (GUVD), Liudmila Vladimirovna Sich. Officers reportedly continued to beat Ardzinov in the sides and lower back as they took him out of the car. He screamed to neighbors for help and at least one neighbor reportedly witnessed the beating.  Under the supervision of Investigator Sich, the officers confiscated all of Ardzinov's human rights documents, including the archives of his organization, his telephone/address book, which likely contained the names of informants and victims whose identities were meant to remain confidential, his passport, his pension card, engineering diploma, and his organizational identification, along with his computer, xerox machine, fax machine, typewriter, all of his blank paper, and his only good suit. They provided no record of what was taken. During the search, the officers reportedly left the apartment in complete disarray. As Ardzinov protested, one officer allegedly punched him in the nose. Then three officers pounced on him, beating him to the floor. According to Mr Ardzinov, they continued to kick and beat him as he lay on the floor of his living room and as they transported him to Tashkent police headquarters.  There, Investigator Hatam Yuldashevich Yakubov reportedly subjected Ardzinov to nine continuous hours of interrogation during which more physical violence was threatened. Yakubov refused Ardzinov's repeated requests for medical assistance and denied him access to his lawyer. The investigator informed Ardzinov that he was charged with hooliganism. Yakubov presented him with written testimony from two witnesses describing offensive letters which Ardzinov allegedly wrote them and distributed to other people. One complainant, Vasilia Inoiatova, a human rights activist from a rival group, confronted Ardzinov in person. Investigator Yakubov questioned another person affiliated with Ardzinov's own organization, Rafshan Hamidov, to give testimony against Ardzinov. Hamidov, who has been in police custody since his arrest on May 14, stated that Ardzinov was involved in anti-state activities and was against the government. Investigator Yakubov did not, however, question Ardzinov about the letters he allegedly wrote, but rather about his human rights organization, his alleged support of Islamists, and his alleged links to exiled opposition leader Mohammed Solih. The government has charged Solih, in exile since 1993, with masterminding the bombings that took place in Tashkent on February 16. In the course of the interrogation, Investigator Yakubov sent Ardzinov to Tashkent's main psychiatric clinic. Ardzinov, whom Soviet officials subjected to two months of groundless psychiatric detention in 1985, refused to speak with doctors. Afterwards, Yakubov and Lieutenant Colonel Derganinov reportedly continued questioning, threatening Ardzinov with detention in the notorious basement of the MVD, where prisoners in pre-trial detention are often tortured. They released Ardzinov at 11:00 pm, ordering him to appear for questioning the next day. Human Rights Watch's Tashkent-based representative provided to Detective Yakubov a written record of the U.S. Embassy medical officer's examination of Ardzinov, which recommended strict bed rest. Yakubov refused to rescind the order for Ardzinov to appear for questioning, however, calling the medical report a """"fabrication."""" Ardzinov remains at home and has announced a hunger strike in response to the charges against him. Mr. Ardzinov was honored by Human Rights Watch in 1996 for his human rights activities in Uzbekistan. Human Rights Watch believes that the arrest, beating, and confiscation of property, which coincide with his advocacy on behalf of individuals painted as government opponents, was intended to curb similar human rights work. The Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan has continuously provided the international community with information on the Uzbek government's crackdown against adherents of independent Islamic groups.  Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the brutal assault on Mr Ardzinov is merely the latest in a series of attacks sponsored by the government against him and other human rights defenders. In 1992, for example, security agents admitted to Mr Ardzinov to having planted an explosive device on the front door of his home which nearly killed him and which caused severe damage to his home. Subsequently, the government has denied him the right to leave the country (which it later lifted under foreign pressure); arbitrarily detained him when he was due to meet with visiting dignitaries or participate in human rights conferences; refused to grant legal status to the human rights organization which he directs; and was complicit in the several physical attacks on him in subsequent years, including only days before his arrest, on June 10. Ardzinov has also been subjected to near constant surveillance since the February 16 bombings in Tashkent. A Human Rights Watch report detailing attacks on human rights activists is forthcoming.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

The convention adopted the next day by the International Labor Organization is intended to ban the most exploitative and hazardous forms of child labor, including child prostitution, slave-like practices, and work that """"jeopardizes the health, safety, or morals of children."""" It's very important that the US back this agreement. But apparently, there is one form of child labor the US is prepared to tolerate: the use of children as soldiers. Child soldiers also engage in work that jeopardizes their health, safety, and morals. An estimated 300,000 children under18 currently participate in armed conflicts around the world, sustaining far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts and often suffering serious psychological damage. Studies show that children at greatest risk of military recruitment during times of conflict are frequently drawn into other forms of child labor during peacetime. These at-risk groups include children who are poor, who have no access to education, are separated from their families, displaced from their homes, or come from marginalized groups. Recognizing the use of child soldiers as a child labor issue, trade unions and many governments sought a broad prohibition on the use of child soldiers in the new International Labor Organization convention. However, the provision quickly became the most controversial item of the two-week negotiating session, as the US launched an aggressive campaign to block a total ban. The US is one of a minority of countries that still recruits minors into its armed forces. In 1997 there were 2,880 17-year-olds on active duty - minors the US could have sent into combat. A total ban on the use of children in armed conflict would put the US in violation of the new convention, because international law defines a child as anyone under 18. To get out of this conundrum, the US pushed - successfully - for a much narrower prohibition on """"forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflicts."""" So, thousands of child soldiers around the world - many much younger than 17 - are left at risk, largely lured into armed groups by promises of payment, food, or protection. """"Voluntary"""" recruits are not covered by the new convention. But what difference does it make how they were recruited? The extreme hazards they face remain the same. The US has clearly opted to sacrifice strong international protections for children in order to protect its own military recruitment policies. Were the US really serious about ending the use of child soldiers, it would be willing to bar the few 17-year-old soldiers in its forces from combat duty in order to achieve a strong international ban. The new ILO convention isn't the only arena where the US opposes strong standards to end the use of child soldiers. A proposed human rights treaty raising the minimum age for participation in armed conflict from 15 to 18 has stalled for five years in the UN largely because of US opposition. In Geneva, Mr. Clinton spoke movingly of the many children who work in conditions that """"shock the conscience"""" and called on every nation to take responsibility to end abusive forms of child labor. For these exhortations to be credible, the US must reexamine its own policies and its own conscience.","United States","Children's Rights, Child Labor, Children and Armed Conflict"

Kim Sen and Meas Minear of the human rights organization, Licadho, are scheduled to go on trial on July 8. They are accused of inciting a violent demonstration against toxic waste dumping in Sihanoukville in late December. The prosecutor of the Sihanoukville court, Mourn Mith, was quoted in the Cambodia Daily on June 23 as saying that no human rights group had """"officially"""" written to request that the charges against rights workers be dismissed.  Last month, on the basis of a six-week investigation into this case, we said the charges should be dropped. Now we are asking the prosecutor general to dismiss the charges, on the grounds of both lack of evidence and procedural irregularities,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch.  Kim Sen and Meas Minear, staff members of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (Licadho), were arrested in December 1998 after monitoring public demonstrations against the dumping of toxic waste in Sihanoukville. The demonstrators did not seek official permission for the protest, and some of them vandalized a local hotel and the house of a senior local official. The two Licadho staff had given advice to angry residents on how to stage a nonviolent and lawful protest.  Detained for a month in late December 1998 until they were granted pre-trial release, Kim Sen and Meas Minear were originally charged with committing robbery and property damage under a 1992 criminal code. According to the court summons issued earlier this month, however, Kim Sen and Meas Minear have now been charged under two articles of the 1991 Law on Demonstrations. The articles prohibit the holding of public demonstrations without at least three days advance notice to the authorities. They also prohibit violence or incitement to violence during the demonstrations.  """"Far from secretly plotting to incite violent demonstrations, the overwhelming evidence is that the human rights workers took every opportunity to inform local officials,"""" said Jones. """"Kim Sen and Meas Minear were simply carrying out their human rights mandate by monitoring the demonstrations and informing citizens of their legal rights to express their grievances peacefully and lawfully.""""  The full text of the letter follows.  June 24, 1999  Mr. Henrot Raken Prosecutor General Phnom Penh Appeals Court Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia  Dear Mr. Henrot Raken:  We are writing to urge you to drop the charges against. Kim Sen and Meas Minear, two staff members of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (Licadho). As you know, they were due to stand trial on June 21, but their attorneys, who did not receive sufficient notice to prepare a defense, urged the court to delay the trial. It is now scheduled to begin on July 8.  We believe the charges should be dropped for several reasons:  Their civil rights have been repeatedly violated through procedural errors. For example, no arrest warrants were produced at the time of their arrests. In addition, as the Court of Appeals has since confirmed, their arrests and detention were improper because the Sihanoukville court did not first review the evidence against them.  There is no evidence whatsoever that Kim Sen and Meas Minear were doing anything other than carrying out their work as human rights defenders at the time of the demonstrations. The primary reason for their presence at the demonstrations was to monitor possible human rights violations that might occur. In addition, in accordance with their human rights mandate, they advised local citizens who were upset by the toxic dumping about human rights and the law.  Far from trying to incite the demonstrators, the two took every opportunity to inform local officials that demonstrations were imminent. When first approached by local residents unhappy about the toxic dumping, Kim Sen telephoned the second deputy governor to relay their complaints. He then advised the residents on how to send a petition to the local authorities, a completely lawful and non-violent way of raising their concerns. At a second meeting with residents, Kim Sen specifically informed them of the requirements of the 1991 Law on Demonstrations. Two Cambodian journalists who attended that meeting have publicly acknowledged thatKim Sen spoke only of a lawful, approved, peaceful demonstration. Finally, when he first learned of the imminent possibility of spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations breaking out, Kim Sen twice telephoned a local police district chief to alert him. Our appeal to you to drop the charges is based on a six-week investigation we conducted in April and May of this year, during which we interviewed government representatives, eyewitnesses to the demonstrations, journalists, and human rights workers. The prosecutor of the Sihanoukville court, Mourn Mith, was quoted in the Cambodia Daily on June 23 as saying that no human rights group had """"officially"""" written to request that the charges against Kim Sen and Meas Minear be dismissed.

In a report released on the eve of an important United Nations visit to Freetown, Human Rights Watch documented how entire families were gunned down in the street, children and adults had their limbs hacked off with machetes, and girls and young women were taken to rebel bases and sexually abused. Government forces and the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force supporting them also carried out serious abuses, although to a lesser extent, including over 180 summary executions of Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and suspected collaborators. """"The January 1999 offensive against Freetown marked the most intensive and concentrated period of human rights violations in Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is not a war in which civilians are accidental victims,"""" said Takirambudde. """"This is a war in which civilians are the targets. The crimes against humanity described in this report are unspeakably brutal, and the world must not simply avert its attention from the crisis. The U.N. and its members states must show that the rights of all human beings are of equal value."""" Takirambudde urged Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights who visits Freetown, Sierra Leone on June 24, to mobilize international support for the investigation and punishment of Sierra Leone's war criminals.  While the current peace negotiations taking place in Lomé, Togo, offer some hope that the civil war may come to a close, Human Rights Watch cautioned against granting amnesty to human rights violators as a condition for peace. """"Conflict in Sierra Leone has been so tenacious precisely because of this cycle of impunity,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Those responsible for torture and mutilations should not walk away scot-free."""" The sixty-page report, """"Getting Away with Murder, Mutilation, and Rape: New Testimony from Sierra Leone,"""" documents how, as rebels took control of the city in January 1999, they made little distinction between civilian and military targets. Testimonies from victims and survivors describe numerous massacres of civilians gathered in houses, churches and mosques. One massacre in a mosque on January 22 resulted in the deaths of sixty-six people. A woman describes how she escaped from a burning house after rebels set her mother and daughter on fire. A child recounts how, from her hiding place, she watched rebels execute seventeen of her family and friends.  The report also includes testimonies from girls and women who describe how they were systematically rounded up by the rebels, brought to rebel command centers and then subjected to individual and gang-rape. Young girls under seventeen, and particularly those deemed to be virgins, were specifically targeted, and hundreds of them were later abducted by the rebels. The rebels carried out large numbers of mutilations, in particular amputation of hands, arms, legs, and other parts of the body. In Freetown, several hundred people, mostly men but also women and children, were killed and maimed in this way. Twenty six civilians were the victims of double arm amputations. One eleven-year-old girl describes how she and two of her friends were taken away by a group of rebels, who then hacked off both of their hands. It is difficult to ascertain what level of the RUF command ordered these human rights abuses, but the report describes how many of the attacks seemed to be well organized, and some were clearly planned and premeditated. Victims and witnesses describe widespread participation in the abuses, with very few accounts of individual combatants or commanders trying to halt them. The report documents special operations to round up civilians for mutilation, rape, and execution, as well as the existence of units specializing in particular forms of atrocities.  The report also documents how the RUF made extensive use of human shields both to enter Freetown and as defense against the air power of the Nigerian-led Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping force. As the rebels withdrew, they set neighborhoods on fire, leaving up to 80 percent of some areas in ashes and an estimated 51,000 civilians homeless.  While the RUF committed the vast majority of atrocities and other violations of international humanitarian law during the battle for Freetown, those defending the capital also committed serious abuses, both during and after the rebel incursion. The report documents how members of ECOMOG, and to a lesser extent members of the Civil Defense Forces(CDF) and Sierra Leonean Police, routinely executed RUF prisoners and their suspected collaborators or sympathizers. While the victims were mostly young men, witnesses confirm the execution of some women, and children as young as eight. Officers to the level of captain were present and sometimes participated in these executions. Human Rights Watch calls on all parties to the war, but especially the RUF rebels, who have been guilty of the worst abuses, to respect international humanitarian law as laid down in the Geneva Conventions and its protocols. In particular, parties to the conflict must distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and desist from targeting civilians for attack.  """"Influencing the actions of the rebel forces in Sierra Leone is difficult,"""" said Takirambudde. """"But international pressure must be maintained to cease indiscriminate killings, rape, mutilation, and the abduction of civilians, especially children.""""  While the international response to the Kosovo crisis has demonstrated how quickly and forcefully it can react to a human rights catastrophe, Human Rights Watch noted with concern the stark contrast with the lack of international response that these appalling atrocities committed in Sierra Leone have received. Eight years of war there have left over 50,000 dead and one million civilians displaced.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, Women's Rights"

High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson on the Sierra Leone Conflict","","06/17/1999","Dear High Commissioner,    Sierra Leone has seen some of the worst violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the world during its terrible eight-year civil war. The current peace negotiations taking place in Lomé, Togo, offer some hope that the country's long nightmare may at last be coming to a close.   Human Rights Watch welcomes the commitment to Sierra Leone and to this peace process shown by your decision to visit the country on June 24. The purpose of your visit is stated in the sixth report of the U.N. secretary-general on the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) to be:    to support the peace process, to encourage future programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country, and to draw attention to the plight of children, women and civilians bearing the brunt of the excesses in Sierra Leone.   Human Rights Watch wholeheartedly supports these objectives. We also believe that your mission must be to ensure that respect for human rights and humanitarian law is built into the very fabric of any ultimate peace accords between the government and rebel forces. If any settlement of the conflict in Sierra Leone is to be lasting and just, it must ensure not only that the current parties lay down their weapons, but also that processes are put in place to ensure that the long cycle of impunity for abuse in Sierra Leone is ended.   In July 1998, Human Rights Watch published a report on human rights abuses and violations of the laws of war in Sierra Leone, """"Sowing Terror: Atrocities Against Civilians in Sierra Leone."""" The report we are publishing today, """"Getting Away with Murder, Mutilation, and Rape: New Testimony from Sierra Leone,"""" details abuses during the January 1999 rebel occupation of the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown. The atrocities we have documented over the past year - similar to abuses committed since the civil war began in 1991 - include gross and systematic abuses by the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), entailing the widespread and indiscriminate murder of civilians; rape; mutilation; abduction of civilians, especially women and children, for purposes of sexual slavery, labor, and training as child combatants; the use of human shields; and violations of medical neutrality. We have also documented abuses by government forces and by the peacekeeping troops of the Nigerian-led Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which has supported the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Though of lesser extent, these abuses are still serious, and include summary executions of suspected rebels or collaborators, use of child soldiers, and indiscriminate bombings.   Both parties have grossly violated the fundamental guarantees of humanitarian law in Sierra Leone. The unthinkable atrocities described in our reports constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Grave breaches of the laws of war and crimes against humanity are crimes of universal jurisdiction: they are so universally recognized as abhorrent and in the interests of the entire international community to suppress that any nation may prosecute the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, the nationality of victims or of where the crime took place.   In Sierra Leone particularly horrific and inhumane methods have been used to fight a war against the civilian population. Human Rights Watch calls on all parties to the war, but especially the RUF rebels, who have been guilty of the worst abuses, to respect international humanitarian law as laid down in the Geneva Conventions and their protocols. In particular, the parties to the conflict must distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and desist from targeting civilians for attack. Although influencing the actions of the rebel forces in Sierra Leone is difficult, international pressure must be maintained to try to ensure that these crimes cease.   On May 18, 1999, the Sierra Leonean government and RUF rebels signed a cease-fire agreement; on May 25, a dialogue between the government and the RUF began at Lomé, Togo. The peace talks are being guided by a facilitation committee chaired by the foreign minister of Togo, with the participation of ECOWAS, the Organization of African Unity, and the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general, Francis G. Okelo. It is not yet clear where these negotiations will lead, but in the meantime hostilities have largely come to a halt in Sierra Leone, though there have been some violations of the May 18 cease-fire reported in the rural provinces.   Any peace process in Sierra Leone must include mechanisms of accountability if it is to bring long term peace and stability to the country. Conflict in Sierra Leone has been built on a cycle of impunity that goes back almost to independence: members of all parties to the current war have benefited from this impunity. Although the ideal would be for all those suspected of having committed criminal human rights abuses to be tried and punished after trials respecting the full extent of national and international law, it is unrealistic to expect that Sierra Leone, in which state institutions such as the judicial system and police force are weak even in the capital and non-existent in much of the country, can hold full-scale trials of all those responsible even for the most egregious human rights abuses. Yet it is necessary for the future peace of the country that those who have committed the worst atrocities, especially those in command positions, are not rewarded with general amnesties and uncritical inclusion in government structures that are supposed to re-establish respect for human rights and the rule of law. The citizens of Rwanda and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) have learnt this lesson only too painfully over the last years - and the people of Sierra Leone can also look back over their own history and see the terrible consequences of repeated access to power by those who have committed gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law and never faced any consequences for their actions.   Human Rights Watch believes that the international community, including UNOMSIL and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, must emphasize the need for the current negotiations to establish mechanisms to ensure that all those in Sierra Leone who have committed grave abuses will be subject to certain minimum processes of accountability, and that those who have committed the most serious abuses are subject to trial and punishment under national and international laws.   In addition to trials for the most serious atrocities, mechanisms of accountability might include the establishment of a """"truth commission"""" to investigate abuses committed by all sides in the civil war, to arrive at findings about those abuses, and to recommend appropriate action against those responsible and steps to be taken to avoid the repetition of similar crimes in future. We welcome the indication given by President Kabbah that he would support the creation of a truth commission. In light of the deep divisions in Sierra Leonean society and the fact that very few individuals would have the stature to be respected by all segments of the population, Human Rights Watch recommends that a truth commission should include international representation among its commissioners and staff. It is important that such a body emphasize justice as well as reconciliation.   Human Rights Watch believes that other key issues that must be addressed in any peace process are:  The revival and strengthening of the program for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants (the DDR program), especially in relation to child soldiers who were originally abducted. The development of concrete plans for meeting the long-term needs of those who were adversely affected by the war, including the thousands of victims of limb amputation and mutilation, sexually abused women, and children who have been victims of atrocities, have witnessed atrocities (sometimes against their own parents) or have themselves taken part in atrocities. The voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced to their homes under conditions which guarantee full respect for the human rights, safety, security and dignity of all. The substantial reinforcement of the human rights monitoring capacity of UNOMSIL, by increasing the numbers of monitors deployed in the country so that both urban and rural areas can be monitored, and by clarifying lines of reporting within the U.N. The establishment of sustainable processes to build respect for human rights and the rule of law in Sierra Leone in the long term, including strengthening local institutions for the protection of human rights, such as the judiciary, a national human rights commission, and nongovernmental human rights groups, as well as creating security forces that are respectful of human rights.  To ensure that Sierra Leone can break the cycle of violence, the international community outside Africa will have to show much greater commitment to Sierra Leone than has currently been the case. Although some governments, including the United Kingdom, United States, the Netherlands, and Canada have made significant contributions, other West African countries, in particular Nigeria, the primary country contributing forces to ECOMOG, and Guinea, which has received the largest number of refugees, have borne the greatest cost from Sierra Leone's civil war - apart from the citizens of Sierra Leone itself. The international community has demonstrated that it can react forcefully to a human rights catastrophe by its response to the Kosovo crisis. Although Human Rights Watch has been critical of some aspects of this response, and in particular has questioned targeting decisions for the bombing raids carried out by NATO, the level of international response to human rights abuses in Kosovo stands in stark contrast to the way in which the appalling atrocities committed in Sierra Leone have largely been ignored.   Your visit to Sierra Leone offers an opportunity for the international community outside Africa to show that the human rights of all human beings are equally valuable. In a recent report on the situation in Kosovo, you stated:   Any durable solution to the crisis in Kosovo will have to be built on a solid foundation of respect for human rights infrastructures, on strong national and local human rights institutions, and on a culture of respect for human rights and tolerance. It must provide an adequate basis for the future observance of human rights and the establishment of effective human rights institutions in Kosovo and throughout the FRY, as well as for the support of long-term programmes that would create or strengthen national human rights capacities.   These words apply equally to Sierra Leone.   Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Executive Director, Africa Division   Joanna Weschler U.N.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/06/16/recommendations-improving-human-rights-situation-armenia","Recommendations for Improving the Human Rights Situation in Armenia","Recommendations for Improving the Human Rights Situation in Armenia","","06/16/1999","I would like to thank you for the written response by your government to our January 15 letter regarding human rights violations in Armenia, and to convey our appreciation for the time and effort you have devoted to this dialogue with Human Rights Watch. I would like to take this opportunity to respectfully clarify several issues in the context of this exchange. Publish all laws, administrative rulings and codes of conduct that govern infractions by conscripts, officers and other Ministry of Defense personnel and that govern conditions and grounds for detention in Ministry of Defense holding facilities and disciplinary battalions. The government letter, dated March 19, noted in response: """"The assertion made by HRW that such laws and codes are not readily available to the public is false. According to Article 6 of the Constitution, ‘laws shall take effect only after official publication. Unpublished juridical acts pertaining to human rights, freedoms and duties shall have no juridical force.' This law is executed by officially printing and publishing all laws and codes in order for them to become public, and to that end, by printing them in Armenian newspapers. The official versions of all laws and codes are readily available in bookstores and libraries. """"The code, which details appropriate conduct for military personnel, disciplinary infractions and punishments, and due process during investigations, is readily available to those serving in the Armenian Army and in public libraries and bookstores."""" We welcome this pledge to make all codes and laws publicly available, and respectfully request that you make available to us a copy of the internal service code, cited in your letter, that details disciplinary breaches in the Armenian army. Throughout our research on human rights conditions in the army, we encountered serious difficulty obtaining this code, as have defense lawyers, nongovernmental organizations, and others in Armenia concerned with the well-being of those performing military service. We recently sought, to no avail, a copy of the internal service code at major libraries and bookshops in Yerevan. These included: Armenian National Library, 72 Terian Street Khango Aper Library, Terian Street Avetik Isahakian Central Library, Amirian Street Library No. 29, 6 Komitas Street Byron Library, 2 Zorian Street Ani Bookstore, Republic Square Noyan Tapan Bookstore, Republic Square Avasa Bookstore, 25 Abovian Street Bukinist Bookstore, 20 Mashtots Prospect Kievian Street Bookstore, 17 Kievian Street During the course of our research, Human Rights Watch investigators interviewed numerous conscripts who had recently completed military service. When asked specifically about the code, none said that they had access. We wish to reiterate our belief that the code's inaccessibility fosters a climate of lawlessness in which abuses against conscripts occur in the army, and hinders the process of accountability. In connection with abuse in the army, we were encouraged to learn in the March 19 letter of your meeting with the mothers of conscripts who died while serving. We intend to publish our findings in a report, which we will present to you and other officials of your government, and to the public. Allow regular and routine access to places of detention to Armenian nongovernmental organizations involved in monitoring and humanitarian assistance to pre-trial detainees and prisoners. The March 19 letter noted in response: """"All places of detention and labor centers are open to all nongovernmental and international organizations for monitoring purposes. Their representatives regularly visit these facilities. On January 1, 1996, an agreement was signed between the ICRC and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security and the Prosecutor General's office according to which the ICRC, within its framework of humanitarian activities, is authorized to visit all facilities under the Ministry and the inmates. """"Regarding Michael Danielyan of the Helsinki Association of Armenia, no formal requests have been submitted by him to the Ministry to visit the above mentioned facilities."""" We greatly appreciate this commitment to transparency in detention centers. However, we continue to be concerned about the limits on access for nongovernmental organizations to carry out monitoring visits, especially given the reports we have received of ill-treatment and poor conditions in these facilities. Please allow us to clarify that on February 6, 1998, Mr. Danielyan submitted a written request to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security to be allowed to carry out monitoring visits. We have attached a copy of this letter, which requests that the Armenian Helsinki Association, in cooperation with the Polish Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, be allowed to conduct joint monitoring visits of Armenian detention facilities. We are concerned that despite this letter and Mr. Danielyan's two subsequent contacts with Ministry staff to discuss the request, to date he has not received a response. Investigate and prosecute instances of harassment of religious minorities by police and other government officials. The government letter responded: """"There have been no registered complaints of harassment of religious minorities by police or other government officials since the new administration has come into power. In fact, during a recent visit by Mr. Jon Huntsman, a prominent member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints specifically made a point of thanking the President and the government for the positive treatment they have received by the State Committee on Religion, pointing out that previously they had faced many problems in registering in Armenia. """"While HRW's accusation that there is harassment of religious minorities was correct in the past, it is no longer true today. In fact, the government has taken many measures to ensure that such violations do not occur in the future by strengthening democratic institutions and creating nongovernmental monitoring and review committees and institutions to buttress his policy. The only group that has not been registered is that of Jehovah's Witnesses, which has not filed any such complaints of harassment other than registration because of their opposition to serve in the military, which is obligatory by law in Armenia. """"Armenia's commitment to freedom of religion is irreversible and all necessary legal measures are being instituted in order to reflect this policy."""" We welcome your government's promise to allow citizens to practice their religion free of discrimination and in a climate of tolerance, in accordance with Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which guarantees individuals the right """"...to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religious or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching."""" As the March 19 letter noted, some religious organizations that were subject to violent attacks in 1995 have been allowed to register; however, other organizations have not, among them, as the letter pointed out, the Jehovah's Witnesses. Adherents of two other non-apostolic faiths who were also attacked in 1995 continue to practice in Armenia, but reportedly so greatly fear the current climate of government-sponsored religious intolerance and persecution of religious minorities that they remain in hiding. We stand by our view that amending Armenia's 1991 law on religion and freedom of conscience—to conform with Article 18 of the ICCPR— is an essential step toward complying with Armenia's international obligations and to promoting religious tolerance. Further, discrimination and violence against adherents of non-apostolic religious faiths in Armenia persist in the context of conscientious objection to compulsory military service by adherents of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith. For instance, attached is a copy of a written complaint submitted by Mrs. Avleta Garayan to procuracy officials, the Ministries of Justice, Defense, and Internal Affairs and National Security. Mrs. Garayan's complaint details two searches of her home on October 29, 1998, by Soviet District Conscription Commission officials who did not have a warrant. During the first visit, officials threatened and insulted her; during the second, they threatened and insulted her guests on account of their religious beliefs. We are particularly concerned about this incident because it took place three days after Mrs. Garayan's son, Tigran Petrossyan, was released from prison. Mr. Petrossyan declared himself a conscientious objector and was sentenced to one and half years in prison for his unwillingness to perform military service. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience after his conviction. Rather than prosecute the officials involved in the incident reported by Mrs. Garayan, officials responded to the complaint by writing to Mrs. Garayan that her son is again liable for military service, and that they intend to prosecute Mr. Petrossiyan, despite the fact that he has already served a prison term for this offense. These threats had forced Mr. Petrossiyan into hiding. We have also attached a copy of our January 29 letter to you detailing allegations of other prosecutions, beatings, warrantless searches, and harassment of conscientious objectors. These victims of this abuse also appear to be the targets of discriminatory treatment after they declare themselves conscientious objectors and request the right to perform alternative military service. In response to our recommendation on the adoption of a law on alternative military service, the March 19 letter stated: """"The Ministry of Defense has made alternative military service available for those who are conscientious objectors to military service where conscripts are exempted from bearing arms. Currently, practical measures are being taken in order to draft a law for alternative military service."""" We would welcome the adoption of a law to provide an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors and the application of such a law in an even-handed, non-arbitrary manner. We kindly request clarification of the government's current standards for making available alternative military service to those who request it, as this would shed light on why some conscientious objectors—such as those who are exempted only from bearing arms— have been allowed to perform alternative service, while others, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are prosecuted. The persistent violence against and prosecution of conscientious objectors who are Jehovah's Witnesses therefore appears attributable not to their incapacity to perform military service, but to their religious affiliation. Statements by government officials about Jehovah's Witnesses cited in our January letter, together with the government's failure to prosecute or discipline those involved in the 1995 attacks on non-apostolic faiths, contribute to a climate of hostility in which this discrimination and violence is perpetrated. Those who have been prosecuted subsequent to our January 15 letter include Artur Martirosyan, sentenced on March 16 to two years in a corrective labor colony for failure to report for duty (article 75 of the criminal code); Armen Asoyan, sentenced on January 9 to three years at Artig Corrective Labor Colony for desertion (article 255), and Rusulan Oganjanyan, sentenced on April 23 to one year in a corrective labor colony for failure to report for duty. Gagik Ohanyan is a conscientious objector in custody undergoing criminal prosecution in Vaik for failure to perform military service, and Grigor Dayan is awaiting trial at Nubarshen Investigative Isolator for failure to report for duty. Three conscientious objectors noted in our January 15 letter — Samvel Manukyan, Artur Stepaniyan and Karen Voskanyan— remain in post- conviction facilities and have been designated prisoners of conscientious by Amnesty International. Publish statistics on complaints against abusive police officers, the results of investigations into complaints, and prosecution of such cases, including the nature of charges and lengths of sentences. The government letter responded: """"Statistics on complaints against abusive police officers and the results of investigations into complaints and their prosecution is readily available for all those who request it, including nongovernmental organizations and private citizens. There is no policy of concealing this information."""" Human Rights Watch requested such statistics—on three occasions last year during meetings with procuracy officials and once in writing and again in writing on May 4 this year—due to reports we received of rampant physical abuse of detainees in police custody. For instance, in our November 13, 1998, letter to Chief Procurator Agvan Hovsepyan, we requested information on the number of police officers investigated and convicted, the offenses for which these police officers were charged, the sentences they received and the facilities where they are currently serving their sentences. The public prosecutor's office subsequently wrote in response to this request that, """"As concerning statistics regarding criminal prosecutions taken against officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, please be advised that figures are the following: for 1996, 20; for 1997, 20; for half-year 1998, 0. We have no additional information."""" We respectfully repeat our request for full information in order to assess specifically how the Armenian criminal justice system prosecutes cases of physical abuse by police officers. In particular, we are concerned about current practice, whereby abusive police are charged under articles of the criminal code that are inappropriate to the serious offenses of which they have been accused. In some cases, they have been charged with """"abuse of office""""; in cases when such abuse has resulted in the death of a detainee, on charges of """"assisting a suicide."""" Convicted officers appear to be released from serving their full sentences by amnesty. Taking advantage of the commitment to openness and transparency expressed in the March 19 letter regarding the results of such investigations, we kindly request any information you may have on the case of Anahid Tumaniyan, about whom we wrote to you on February 5. We have attached a copy of our letter, and we were concerned to learn that as of the end of April no official had contacted Ms. Tumaniyan or her family members as part of an investigation into her complaint. As the attached letter details, Mrs.Tumaniyan told Human Rights Watch that police at the Erebuni District Police Station severely beat her, her two children, sixteen-year-old Aram and twenty-two-year-old Varduhi Tumaniyan, and her twenty-year-old sister-in-law, Christina Torosiyan, in an effort to coerce them into signing false testimony and confessions. Finally, the government's response noted: """"The HRW report inaccurately states that, the Yerkrapah organization has ... been responsible for ... attacks such as the ransacking of a human rights center library in Vanadzor on July 29, 1997. No such action has taken place by the Yerkrapahs."""" We have attached for your information a copy of the statement describing this incident issued on August 20, 1997 by the Armenian Constitutional Rights Protection Center of Vanadzor, that names some of the approximately ten people who participated in the ransacking of the library, including members of the Yerkrapah organization in Vanadzor. We have also attached a copy of the Armenian State Arbitrage court's decision, dated April 18, ordering the city of Vanadzor to pay 149,700 drams in damages to the center because it was unable to inhabit the premises it had previously rented from the city as a result of """"the intercession of a third party."""" The U.S. government has also implicated the Yekrapahs in this incident, which was cited in the 1998 U.S. State Department Armenia Country Report on Human Rights Practices. The report stated, """"Promised new quarters by the mayor after the site originally offered (two rooms in a children's library) had been forcibly reclaimed in July 1997 by local Yerkrapah officials at the behest of the children's librarian, a human rights library in Vanadzor was still seeking resources at year's end to make the replacement quarters usable. No charges were ever filed against the persons who forced the lock on the human rights library."""" As we previously noted, we remain concerned that there have been no criminal prosecutions of those responsible, despite that fact that the state arbitrage court has acknowledged that the incident took place and the names of some of the participants are known. Furthermore, Yekrapah appears to enjoy continued impunity for such attacks. The State Department report noted that members of the Yerkrapah have been implicated in other incidents, including an attack on members of an opposition political party on last year: """"On March 8, persons alleged to be associated with the Yerkrapah faction violently broke up an election rally in Ararat by the National Democratic Union (NDU). Eight NDU members were hospitalized as a result of the attack, including Filaret Berikyan, the NDU representative to the Central Election Committee. The police chief of Ararat was fired for failure to maintain order. Four of the alleged attackers were arrested, convicted, and sentenced in June by the Ararat court to 2 years in prison for interfering in the electoral process. The sentence was suspended and the four were placed on probation."""" Human Rights Watch interviewed Mr. Berikyan regarding this incident after it occurred, and he stated that as many as fifty individuals took part in the attack. We are therefore surprised that only four people were held accountable for it, and that their sentences were suspended. As we noted in our earlier correspondence, we believe that Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe is premature until the government takes concrete and significant steps to improve human rights, in law and in practice. We intend to reiterate our recommendation to the Parliamentary Assembly that it take no further action on Armenia's membership application until the government addresses these and other issues. In this connection, we will be forwarding you shortly a number concerns regarding recently adopted legislation on the independence of the judiciary and protection for those in custody while under investigation for criminal offenses. Please accept my thanks again for the attention with which your government has considered our concerns. I look forward to further dialogue with you and members of your government regarding human rights practices in Armenia.

Although trade unions and many governments supported a total ban on the participation of children in armed conflict, strong U.S. pressure resulted in the adoption of a much narrower prohibition on """"forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflicts.""""  """"Child soldiers are in terrible danger no matter how they are recruited,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"This narrow provision fails to protect thousands of child soldiers who are lured or coerced into warfare.""""  An estimated 300,000 child soldiers currently participate in armed conflicts around the world, sustaining far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts and suffering serious psychological damage.  The United States has been a leading opponent of another proposed international agreement to establish eighteen as a minimum age for recruitment and participation in armed conflict. The United States is one of a minority of countries that still recruits minors, although it has fewer than 7,000 minors in its 1.5 million active duty force. Five years of United Nations-sponsored negotiation have failed to produce a comprehensive ban on the use of child soldiers, largely due to U.S. opposition.  Becker said the United States was sacrificing strong international protections for children in order to protect its own military recruitment policies. """"Recruits under the age of eighteen are a neglible part of the U.S. armed forces,"""" she said.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/06/14/letter-governor-virginia","Letter to Governor of Virginia","Letter to Governor of Virginia","","06/14/1999","We are writing to urge you to commute the death sentence of Douglas Christopher Thomas, who is scheduled for execution tomorrow. Mr. Thomas was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1990 murder of his girlfriend's parents, crimes which he committed at the age of seventeen and apparently at his girlfriend's behest. No civilized society can accept the execution of a person who was a child at the time he committed his crimes. Mr. Thomas's execution would disregard international standards which call upon states not to execute juvenile offenders. Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party, expressly forbids the imposition of capital punishment on offenders who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the crime for which they were convicted. Although the United States purports to reserve the right to impose capital punishment on juvenile offenders, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the treaty body charged with interpreting the Covenant, has concluded that the U.S. reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and therefore void as a matter of international law. The international standard forbidding the execution of juvenile offenders reflects the reality that children are different from adults; that they lack the experience, perspective, judgment, maturity, and restraint of an adult; and that with help even the most errant may be rehabilitated. Around the world, even in societies with harsh criminal justice systems, the law acknowledges the immorality and injustice of imposing death—a uniquely cruel and irreversible punishment—for crimes committed by children. The United States shares with countries such as Iran, Nigeria, and Pakistan the dubious distinction of being willing to defy the worldwide consensus that the death penalty should not be imposed for crimes committed by juveniles. By granting clemency to Mr. Thomas, you can help to bring this country's practice into line with a basic principle of international justice. We are troubled by the fact that significant mitigating factors were never considered by the jury in Mr. Thomas's case. A clinical psychologist testified that Mr. Thomas was """"developmentally immature"""" and unable """"to make decisions at an adult level."""" Mr. Thomas's schoolteachers testified that he had a troubled youth and was susceptible to the influence of others. Although factors such as these surely play a role in determining a individual's culpability for the crimes he or she has committed, the jury in Mr. Thomas's case found no mitigating circumstances. We are also concerned by the way Mr. Thomas's case was transferred from juvenile court to the circuit court. Mr. Thomas's first court-appointed attorney, later relieved as counsel in the case, waived his right to a juvenile court hearing. Although Mr. Thomas later sought unsuccesfully to repudiate his former counsel's action, he was tried as an adult without receiving a transfer hearing before a juvenile court judge, who would have had the opportunity to consider the nature of his offense, his age and history, and the possibility of treating him in the juvenile system. The decision to try a child as an adult should only be made by a judge after a full and impartial hearing—certainly not, as in Mr. Thomas's case, by the actions of an attorney who is later dismissed. It is particularly disturbing that Mr. Thomas never received an individualized transfer hearing even though he faced the death sentence if tried as an adult. Human Rights Watch, the largest U.S.-based international human rights organization, opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. We believe that executions are oftern carried out in a discriminatory manner and inflicted primarily on the most vulnerable—the poor, minorities, and mentally ill or retarded persons. The instrinsic fallability of all criminal justice systems ensures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons are sometimes executed. Therefore, we oppose all executions under law whenever and wherever carried out, irrespective of the crime and the legal process leading to their implementation. We urge you to grant clemency to Douglas Christopher Thomas. Sincerely, Michael Bochenek Counsel Children's Rights Division","United States",""

In fact, the forty-four-year-old Fang was almost certainly arrested because of his advocacy of political reform.  Regardless of whether there is any substance to the allegations, the arrest is clearly politically motivated."""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. She said that anyone with commercial interests in China should be alarmed by the Fang Jue case. """"Whether Chinese officials use unfair business practices as a pretext for arresting reformers or political charges as a pretext for arresting business people, it means that no one is safe from political manipulation of the law.""""

Two Cambodian organizations, Adhoc and Licadho, joined with an international human rights organization, Human Rights Watch, to document the failure of the government at all levels to prosecute civilian and military authorities for killing and torture. The three organizations called on members of the Consultative Group (CG) on Cambodia, the international donor consortium scheduled to meet in Phnom Penh on June 14, to focus on legal and judicial reform as an integral part of any assistance program. One way to do this would be for the donor group to establish a Rule of Law and Judicial Reform Working Group to evaluate the Cambodian government's progress in improving the human rights situation. """"The role of Cambodia's donors is crucial in promoting major human rights improvements and ending impunity,"""" said Thun Saray, president of Adhoc. """"Impunity is one of the major impediments not only for the protection of human rights and the establishment of the rule of law in Cambodia, but for the confidence of donors and investors alike.""""  During a two-month investigation into impunity in Cambodia, the rights organizations found that a major cause of the problem was a lack of political will by the government to prosecute known human rights abusers. Adding to the problem is the lack of neutrality and independence of the judicial and law enforcement systems, as well as a low level of professionalism in these bodies.  Cambodia also has a law, Article 51 of the Common Statutes on Civil Servants, which gives ministries the right to waive prosecution of their employees, thus providing a form of state-sanctioned impunity to government officials. The report also identifies as a problem the excessive use of lethal force and misuse of weapons by law enforcement officials. Decades of war have left behind a culture of violence where the instant reaction to an apparent crime is to kill the perpetrator, rather than waiting for a case to work its way through the politicized, weak, and often corrupt court system. In Phnom Penh, for example, the rights organizations found that at least one in every thirteen arrests during 1998 resulted in either death or injury; out of 1,152 arrests, police killed seventy-six people and wounded twelve. The report was based in part on a study by Adhoc and Licadho that found that between January 1997 and October 1998 at least 263 people were allegedly killed by police, military, gendarmes, militia, or civil servants. Roughly half these killings were committed by soldiers, with police responsible for another 22 percent. The vast majority of the killings have gone uninvestigated and unpunished.  """"The call to end impunity is not a call for revenge. It is a call for justice,"""" said Kek Galabru, president of Licadho. """"Without proper investigations into human rights violations, an important obstacle to the development of democracy remains, which can lead to even worse abuses.""""  At the February 1999 CG meeting of Cambodia's donors convened by the World Bank in Tokyo, Cambodia received pledges of some U.S. $470 million. However, aid commitments by bilateral donors and international financial institutions were conditioned on the government's implementation of political, economic and social reforms that it promised to undertake.  Prior to the CG meeting, the Cambodian government announced an extensive reform package, including its support for human rights. In the government's report for the meeting, it pledged to reaffirm its """"unbreakable attachment to liberal democracy, to the freedom of expression, to an independent judiciary, to neutrality and discipline in the armed forces and national police, to the strengthening of the rule of law and compliance with national and international laws, to encouraging all strata of civil society to participate actively in the political, economic and social life of the country..."""" """"We urge the donors to strictly monitor the government's compliance with its commitments, in particular on human rights,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"It's time for the government to live up to its pledges and actually launch the reforms needed to end the problem of impunity."""" Among the recommendations made by the three human rights organizations to end impunity are the following: Initiate serious, independent, and thorough investigations and prosecute those responsible for hundreds of killings and other serious human rights violations that have taken place since the founding of the Royal Cambodian Government in 1993. Repeal Article 51 of the Common Statutes on Civil Servants. Take immediate steps to discipline or dismiss court officials for failure to prosecute cases and law enforcement officials for failure to investigate and report on cases. Hold police and military officers accountable for any crimes they commit and enforce prohibitions against their interference in the administration of justice. Support the program of confiscating unlicensed weapons in Cambodia and back it up by enforcement of prohibitions against illegal use of weapons, whether licensed or not. Enforce provisions in Cambodian law that require police to report actions involving injury or death of suspects to their superiors. Independent judicial inquiries should be conducted in regard to all such cases. Periodically rotate police and court personnel to different departments or geographical locations to reduce the possibility of corruption and nepotism. Enforce legal prohibitions in Cambodian law against out-of-court financial compensation for felonies and major criminal offenses. Police and local officials should not take commissions in settlements of any cases, civil or criminal. Support the work of local human rights organizations and the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights so that they can continue to monitor and investigate reports of impunity.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Michigan. The                     Department of Justice filed suit against MDOC in                     March 1997, alleging that inmates at the Crane and                     Scott correctional facilities were subject to sexual                     abuse and misconduct as well as unlawful invasions                     of privacy.  As you may know, Human Rights Watch has done extensive work documenting human rights abuses and retaliation against women incarcerated in the Michigan prison system. In our reports, All Too Familiar: Sexual Abuse of Women in U.S. State Prisons and Nowhere To Hide: Retaliation against Women in Michigan State Prisons, we detailed the problems and recommended specific measures to remedy the situation, including a confidential means of reporting abuse and impartial investigation of such allegations, independent monitors, and ensuring that accused staff are not in a position to retaliate against complainants. Based on our research and experience with MDOC's past handling of such matters, we are troubled that the settlement does not correct the most serious barriers to ensuring that women's rights are respected and that women who report abuse do so without fear of retaliation. We recently met with Department of Justice officials to express our concerns regarding this settlement as well as to address the broader question of the Department of Justice's role in promoting and protecting the human rights of women incarcerated in U.S. state and federal prisons. While we appreciate the opportunity we had at the meeting to express our concerns, we want to reiterate our strong objections to the content of this agreement and urge you to withdraw the Justice Department's motion for conditional dismissal of the suit, reinstate the complaint, and press MDOC for more substantial reforms.. First, the settlement agreement fails to establish an independent oversight mechanism to monitor the reporting, investigation, and prosecution of abuses against women in the Michigan prisons. The predominantly male corrections staff in the Michigan prisons exercises near total control over the lives of the women inmates. Our research shows that women do not a have a safe and secure means of reporting abuse nor do they have confidence that the reports will be adequately investigated. Women's reports of abuse have been dismissed without serious investigation, and inmates who report abuse have been retaliated against by staff who suffer no consequences for their actions. The Michigan Department of Corrections' repeated refusal to allow independent monitoring raises serious questions about its commitment to conducting thorough investigations into allegations of abuse by corrections staff. The risk of abuse is too great and the ability of the women to stop the abuse is far too! limited to allow the corrections department to monitor itself. In both All Too Familiar and Nowhere To Hide, Human Rights Watch called for independent oversight of prisons as a check against abuse and to ensure that departments of corrections do not hide, rather than solve, abusive situations. Second, the settlement agreement compounds the women's vulnerability to abuse by permitting the Corrections Department to issue major misconduct tickets to women whose claims of abuse are deemed """"unfounded."""" The Michigan Department of Corrections has used """"unfounded"""" and """"unsubstantiated"""" interchangeably when discussing women's reports of abuse. The agreement leaves open the possibility that MDOC will punish inmates who file a claim that cannot be substantiated, however well-founded it may be. Such an agreement will have a chilling impact on the women, who will face serious consequences for filing reports of abuse, which, though factually true, may be deemed """"unfounded"""" by the Corrections Department. Investigators for the Department of Justice found that virtually every woman they interviewed at Michigan's Scott Correctional Facility feared retaliation by the corrections staff if they reported abuse. Human Rights Watch has urged that disciplinary action be taken only when M! DOC determines that a woman filed a false report with malicious intent. Third, the agreement creates the position of a Special Administrator, who will report to MDOC's director, responsible for addressing issues concerning women inmates, yet fails to specify how women will be able to communicate with the Special Administrator with full guarantees that their communication will be kept confidential. The women we have talked with have complained repeatedly that their calls, including calls to attorneys, are monitored and their mail, including their legal mail, is opened. Given the many documented cases of retaliation against women who have reported sexual abuse and the pervasive fear of retaliation expressed by all the women, it is imperative that the settlement agreement provide women with a safe and secure means of reporting sexual abuse and other violations both to the Special Administrator and, if this complaint goes unanswered, to an independent oversight agency. Fourth, the settlement agreement calls for the adoption of a """"knock and announce"""" policy, requiring male officers to announce their presence in any areas where women could be in a state of undress. This policy is wholly inadequate in addressing the privacy violations found by both Department of Justice investigators and by Human Rights Watch as it does not prevent male guards from knocking, announcing, and barging in without waiting. Women consistently reported male guards viewing them as they change clothes in their cells, shower, and toilet. Human Rights Watch has proposed that, recognizing a basic right to privacy, male guards should be restricted from showers, toilets, and housing units during specified periods when female inmates are dressing and undressing. Fifth, the settlement agreement imposes a dress code on the women inmates. The imposition of a dress code sends the wrong message to the corrections staff. It effectively shifts the blame for sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and invasions of privacy from the offending corrections staff to the women. The women's rights movement has worked for decades to dispel the myth that women """"provoke"""" attacks or """"ask for it"""" by dressing in ways which are perceived as """"immodest."""" By imposing a dress code on the women, the settlement not only places the blame squarely on the women, but it gives the corrections officers another means to punish and harass the women. Finally, the settlement agreement calls for an expert to tour the facilities three and six months after the execution of the agreement, after which time the complaint will either be dismissed or reinstated. Such limited access by the expert over such a short period of time will not allow for the expert to determine if the Michigan Department of Corrections has changed the current, abusive situation. This six month monitoring period is particularly disturbing in light of the provision for a six-month moratorium on cross-gender pat-down searches. If cross-gender pat-down searches resume after six months, there will be no means to check if they are being done in an abusive manner, as was alleged by a significant number of women inmates. Human Rights Watch recommends that compliance monitoring be in place for at least two years, include unlimited unannounced site visits by the expert, and allow for reinstatement of the complaint if the expert finds at any point that compliance! is substantially lacking. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly called on the U.S. Department of Justice to take the measures necessary to promote and protect the human rights of women incarcerated in the United States in keeping with domestic and international standards. Yet our attempts to draft national legislation that would provide some basic protections for incarcerated women have met with strong resistance from the Department of Justice. This resistance coupled with the profoundly flawed Michigan settlement agreement raise serious questions about this administration's commitment to women's human rights and to ending impunity for violence against women. We urge you to ensure that the Department of Justice defends the rights of women in prison by pushing for reforms from the Michigan Department of Corrections that are better designed to root out sexual abuse and misconduct and MDOC's tolerance thereof and by supporting legislative efforts to protect the rights of women in prison.

""""The right to free speech is routinely violated in Turkey,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Turkish governments since the 1980s have promised to lift restrictions on freedom of expression, but Mr. Birdal's experience shows how hollow those promises are."""" Mr. Birdal was convicted and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment by the Ankara State Security Court in July 1998 for a speech he made on September 1, 1996 calling for """"peace and understanding""""with respect to the Kurdish minority. Birdal was convicted for """"inciting racial hatred"""" under article 312 of the Turkish Penal Code. The indictment specifically mentioned Birdal's reference in the speech to """"the Kurdish people"""" as an incriminating phrase. The sentence was confirmed on appeal on October 27, 1998. As a result of the conviction, Birdal will no longer be able to act as president of the HRA and will no longer be permitted to be an official of any association. The ban is a lifetime ban, but may be appealed after five years. There are several other charges currently pending against Birdal, all related to his writings and public speeches. He will serve his sentence at the Ankara Central Closed Prison. Ms. Cartner noted that although Turkey claims to be a democracy, Turkish citizens run the risk of prosecution, imprisonment, and sometime worse if they try to begin a peaceful public dialogue on a sensitive topic such as the rights of the Kurdish minority. In addition to facing numerous criminal prosecutions, Birdal was physically attacked on May 12, 1998, when two gunmen entered his office in downtown Ankara and shot him seven times in the lungs and leg. The attack followed a reckless campaign in the press purportedly based on leaked information from the prosecutor's office about alleged connections between the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) and the Human Rights Association. These accusations were later shown to be false. Immediately after the attack, then-Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz repeated the accusations against the HRA, describing the attack as part of an internal feud within the PKK. However, the extreme right-wing organization Turkish Revenge Brigade took responsibility for the attack.

While most child soldiers are in their teens, some are as young as seven years old. While many child soldiers start out as cooks, messengers, porters or guards, too often they end up on the front lines of combat. Children who participate in armed conflict are at risk of serious injury and death. Because of their relative inexperience and lack of training, child soldiers suffer far higher casualty rates than adult soldiers. Those who survive may be permanently disabled, or suffer psychological damage—including post-traumatic stress disorder—as a consequence of their exposure to the violence of warfare. While many child soldiers are forcibly recruited, others join armed groups hoping to support themselves or their family, or simply because they believe it is their best chance at survival. Studies have shown children at greatest risk of military recruitment during times of conflict are frequently drawn into child labor during peacetime. These at-risk groups include children who are poor, who have no access to education, are separated from their families, displaced from their homes, or from marginalized groups. The Child Labor Convention: The new ILO (International Labor Organization) Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor is intended to protect children from the most exploitative and hazardous forms of child labor, including slavery, forced labor, child prostitution and work which jeopardizes the health, safety or morals of children. In accordance with other international law, the convention defines a child as anyone under the age of eighteen. The Convention was negotiated in June 1999 at the International Labor Conference, which is made up of delegates from ILO members states, including delegates from employer's and worker's organizations. U.S. Policy and Child Soldiers: The United States opposed efforts to include a broad prohibition on the use of child soldiers in the new child labor convention, instead pushing to a narrow provision prohibiting """"forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflicts."""" The United States is also a leading opponent of a five-year effort to raise the international minimum age for recruitment and participation in armed conflict from the current fifteen to eighteen. Under international law, the general definition of a child is any person under the age of 18. The U.S. position is based on U.S. recruitment practices, which allow seventeen-year-olds to enlist voluntarily for military service with parental permission. However, according to Department of Defense statistics, there are less than 7000 minors in the U.S. armed services, making up less than one-half of one percent of the total 1.5 million active duty force, and only 4% of new active duty recruits each year.","Global","Children and Armed Conflict, Crisis and Conflict"

Since the government-appointed Landau Committee first provided official authorization for these procedures in 1987, GSS torture techniques have caused the death of at least one Palestinian detainee and many more cases of permanent injuries. Israel is a party to both the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Both treaties prohibit torture under all circumstances, even during a state of war or other public emergency. Both treaties also require states to take effective legislative, administrative, or judicial measures to ensure that this prohibition is enforced. Human Rights Watch calls upon the High Court to meet its responsibility as the highest judicial authority by acting decisively to prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in Israel. Rather than living up to Israel's treaty obligations, the High Court, the Knesset, and the government of Israel have consistently failed to take effective action to stop torture. The High Court has routinely accepted the government's argument that the use of physical force in interrogation is justified to obtain urgently needed information in order to save lives or property. In past rulings on requests for interim injunctions against the use of physical force in interrogating a specific individual, the High Court has explicitly stated its unwillingness to express an opinion on the legality of particular interrogation procedures. The cases now before the High Court directly challenge the legality of these interrogation procedures, already found by the CAT and ICCPR treaty-monitoring bodies to constitute torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The government's position is that the use of these prohibited procedures is not illegal in Israeli law, is justified by urgent security needs, and in any case do not meet the threshold of """"severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental"""" required by the definition of torture in the CAT.   Both the CAT and the ICCPR explicitly prohibit the argument that public emergencies, or any other reason, can be a justification for torture. Israel's use of """"ticking bomb"""" arguments is thus clearly inadmissible under both treaties. Second, these interrogation procedures are known to have caused permanent physical disability and death – the argument that they are not """"severe"""" lacks all credibility. Finally, both the CAT and the ICCPR explicitly require States to amend their domestic legislation to prohibit practices, such as these interrogation methods, which constitute torture. Israel has a legal obligation to prohibit the use of these interrogation procedures under all circumstances, without exception. Wednesday's hearing will be the fourth time the High Court has heard arguments in this case. In earlier sessions some Justices have expressed an unwillingness to rule on the principle of the case, suggesting that if Israel wants to outlaw torture it is the Knesset's responsibility to enact legislation. The Knesset, like the executive branch, does have a responsibility to take measures to prohibit torture, but its failure to do so in no way absolves the High Court from fulfilling its own responsibility. In fact, the High Court's obligation to prohibit torture is even greater in light of the other branches of government's failure to act. Human Rights Watch urges the High Court to fulfill that obligation by ruling unambiguously to prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under all circumstances.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","Torture"

It's the perfect occasion for China to release the remaining Tiananmen-era prisoners, clear the names of those already freed, agree to compensate the victims, and allow pro-democracy activists in exile abroad to return home,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. She noted that there were precedents, notably after the Cultural Revolution, for Chinese authorities to declare that government actions against the populace were wrong, paving the way for rehabilitation of the victims. """"There has never been a full accounting for what took place ten years ago on the night of June 3-4,"""" said Jones, """"but the number of victims far exceeds the hundreds killed in the streets around Tiananmen Square."""" She said victims included those wounded, many of whom continue to be scarred politically as well as physically by their experience. In addition to the dozens of protestors who remain imprisoned, there are thousands who spent years in prison or labor camps for taking part in protests that erupted across China in the weeks that followed the June 4 crackdown, many of whom faced persecution after their release. And there is the official blacklist of Tiananmen-era activists, either released from prison directly into exile abroad, like Wang Dan, or barred from returning to China because of pro-democracy activities abroad. Human Rights Watch said that over the last ten years, international pressure was critical in securing the releases of many of the June 4 prisoners, including those named as the """"black hands"""" or masterminds of the pro-democracy movement. But as concern over human rights in China gave way to security and economic interests, there was a danger that the remaining prisoners, and the need for rehabilitation of all the Tiananmen victims, would be forgotten. """"The most important task of the international community now is to support the efforts of those inside China fighting on behalf of the June 4 victims,"""" said Jones. """"This means ensuring they are seen and heard by reducing state controls on the media, including the Internet. It means getting international access to the huge Chinese prison system. It means supporting legal reform so that victims and their families have a fair chance of challenging the government in court, with all the legal assistance they need. And it means continuing to call openly and publicly for a reversal of the Chinese government's official verdict on the June 4 movement."""" Human Rights Watch also called on China to use the June 4 anniversary to review the cases of some 2,000 prisoners sentenced to crimes of """"counterrevolution,"""" an offense that was formally abolished last year. Many people, including some Tiananmen Square prisoners, are serving sentences for counterrevolutionary crimes for doing nothing more than peacefully exercising fundamental rights of expression, association, and assembly.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

It called on the agency to move the refugees who are in camps too close to the border to safer locations inside Guinea, as they are doing for Kosovar refugees in northern Albania.  The refugees, who are fleeing the civil war in Sierra Leone, live in refugee camps close to the border -- some as close as half a mile away. Since March 1999, these camps have frequently come under attack by Sierra Leonean rebels. Dozens of civilians, including Guineans and refugees, have been killed, mutilated, and abducted during these attacks. """"The brutality and the frequency of these attacks is simply atrocious,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Refugee camps are supposed to be a safe haven, but these camps in Guinea are a magnet for attack.""""  Sierra Leonean refugees in the Tassin refugee camp in the Forecariah area of Guinea came under attack by forces operating from Sierra Leone on May 22. Eleven civilians were killed during the attack. This was the second attack on the Tassin camp and fifth attack targeting refugee camps in the Forecariah area since March of this year. There have also been several attacks on refugee camps in the Gueckedou area, where approximately 350,000 Sierra Leonean refugees live.  In one case, a refugee in the Forecariah area reportedly had his two hands and tongue cut off by the rebels. Human Rights Watch has interviewed several victims of these attacks including a ten-year-old gunshot victim and a woman whose husband was abducted. Attacking forces have also burned down refugees' homes during these raids. Most attacks have been short raids conducted overnight. Their aim is apparently to abduct refugees, steal supplies, and instill terror.  """"It is a long-standing, fundamental principle that refugee camps should not be located close to international borders with a war raging just on the other side,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"These refugees should not have been settled so close to the border in the first place. Their location leaves them completely vulnerable to armed attacks and abduction, and they must be moved immediately.""""  In June 1998, Human Rights Watch first called on the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to move the refugees, in accordance with international law. Human Rights Watch has also urged UNHCR not to settle new refugees too close to the border, and to ensure that the human rights of the refugees are respected in the moving process. Fewer than 10,000 of the refugees have been moved to date. The rainy season has already begun in Guinea and, in the very near future, unpaved roads leading to the refugee camps may become impassible, making it extremely difficult to move refugees to safety.  Kosovar refugees in northern Albania face similar risks of being caught in the cross-fire between the parties fighting in Kosovo. Unlike in Guinea, however, UNHCR has taken pains to encourage refugees to move to safer camps in southern Albania. UNHCR has transported approximately 2,000 refugees to southern Albania per day over the past few weeks. UNHCR requested $4 million to move refugees in Guinea to safety but has yet to receive the entire budget. In Albania, UNHCR has recognized that moving the refugees away from the border with Kosovo is a priority. It has essentially unlimited funds for the move.

The death toll could well rise. The army claimed they had used only rubber bullets and had fired in self-defense after shots were fired at their troops. Hospital sources reported that the victims, who ranged in age from seven to sixty, had been shot with lead bullets, and villagers said the army opened fire without warning. Video footage showed soldiers shooting at fleeing protestors. The shootings are the latest in a series of violent incidents in and around Lhokseumawe that began in late August 1998. The violence is the result of an explosive mixture of several factors: local anger at the failure of the Habibie government to address the issues of past military abuses in the area; increased activity in the Lhokseumawe area of two groups, the insurgent group, Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (the Free Aceh Movement, known as GAM) and a separate, nonviolent, and fast-growing movement aimed at securing a referendum on Aceh's political status; and the excessive use of force and commission of grave human rights abuses by the Indonesian army, partly in response to that activity. As with all political unrest in Indonesia, there is widespread belief locally but little hard evidence that military elements are provoking the violence. Aceh, unlike East Timor, is critical to the survival of Indonesia as a nation. East Timor was never part of the Indonesian nationalist struggle, and its departure from the Indonesian republic, to which it was illegally annexed in 1976, will not shake the concept of Indonesian nationhood. Aceh was not only at the forefront of the nationalist struggle against the Dutch colonial government, but it is vital to Indonesia politically, strategically, and economically. If violence continues to escalate and demands for independence grow stronger, the government in Jakarta will face immensely difficult choices. At this stage, the only conceivable way to try halting the unrest is to ensure that military abuses dating back to 1990 and going up to May 3 are fully and transparently investigated and prosecutions initiated. This report outlines the details of the May 3 shooting and the key events that have led to rising violence in Aceh. Much of the information is based on a visit to Lhokseumawe in February 1999, with additional information obtained from local human rights organizations. Recommendations Human Rights Watch calls on the Indonesian government to invite to Aceh as soon as possible the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions and the U.N. Working Group on Disappearances, to examine the causes, context, and consequences of the May 3 massacre as well as past extrajudicial executions, including the Idi Cut killings of February 2 and 3, outlined below. An invitation to the special rapporteur is particularly urgent, as past visits of U.N. human rights specialists, such as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in February 1999 and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women in November 1998, did not include visits to Aceh. We also call on the government to form both a joint fact-finding team, similar to the one appointed after the May 1998 violence in Jakarta, and a military honor council, to work together to more clearly identify the units and individuals involved in the shootings and initiate prosecutions as warranted. The two teams should also investigate the series of incidents beginning in August 1998 that have led to such a dramatic and tragic escalation of violence in Aceh. The government should cancel plans agreed to in February 1999 to form a new regional military command for Aceh, known as Kodam Iskandar Muda, and work toward reducing, not increasing, army troop strength in Aceh. Finally, in light of Acehnese outrage of the impunity the military enjoys for past violations of human rights, the govenrnment should take concrete steps to gather evidence against key officers in the military chain of command responsible for abuses during the period 1990-1998 and begin formal prosecutions without delay.","Asia, Indonesia","Crisis and Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/05/28/turkey-kurds-continue-be-denied-political-and-cultural-rights","Turkey- Kurds Continue to be Denied Political and Cultural Rights","Turkey: Kurds Continue to be Denied Political and Cultural Rights","Backgrounder on Repression of the Kurds in Turkey","05/28/1999","Approximately one fifth of Turkey's 63 million people are of Kurdish ethnicity. Their traditional homeland is in the mountainous southeastern provinces, though perhaps half of Turkey's Kurds now live in Istanbul and other cities in the west of the country. Kurds are most sharply distinguished from the rest of the population by their mother tongue--the Kurdish family of languages--which is linguistically very different from Turkish. Many rural Kurds, and particularly the women (since they are not required to leave their village for military service), speak only Kurdish. Denied political, and cultural rights, Kurds have been the principal victims of the Turkish state's excesses since the military coup of 1980. (It should be noted that, ironically--or tragically--the majority of victims of PKK abuses have also been Kurds.) Kurds are not targeted by the security forces because of their ethnicity per se. Many Kurds who align themselves closely with the Turkish state have been elected to parliament or hold high political office. However, any attempt to assert political or cultural rights based on Kurdish identity is looked upon as treason and as a threat to the very foundations of the Turkish state--and punished accordingly. The denial of cultural and political rights has generated a long-standing sense of grievance among some sectors of the Kurdish minority, and this has made them a fertile source of recruits for illegal radical armed organizations--in particular the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which began attacks on gendarmerie posts and other state installations in 1984. These attacks in turn provoked fierce repression--mass arrests followed by interrogation under torture, and trials in martial law courts and State Security Courts which fell far short of international standards of justice. Government and military officials of the Turkish Republic have even admitted that they are often unable to identify who is a PKK activist in the southeast. As a result, the population as a whole has often been targeted and has endured two decades of terrible hardship, instability, and fear. Kurdish villagers in particular have been subjected to frequent security raids in which they have been abused, tortured, and even """"disappeared,"""" or extrajudicially executed. Many commentators agree that the crude and wholesale methods used by the military only serve to boost PKK recruitment. In the mid-1980s, in an attempt to isolate those Kurdish communities that were offering tactical support for the PKK, the Turkish government began to arm Kurdish villagers as """"provisional village guards."""" Although village guards were theoretically set up to defend villages from attack, the Turkish security forces have used them as auxiliaries for raids into neighboring villages. Village guard service is in theory voluntary, but any village that refused to join the paramilitary system was suspected of being sympathetic to the PKK and therefore subjected to frequent security raids, or forcibly evacuated and burned to the ground. On the other hand, enrollment in the village guard system automatically puts that community on the hit-list for attack by the PKK. There is no middle ground for the Kurdish peasant, who is completely trapped between the two sides to the conflict. The village of Nurettin serves as a good example of how the state used the village guard system to displace those villagers who refused to join. The 1994 Human Rights Watch Report """"Forced Displacement of Ethnic Kurds from Southeastern Turkey"""" documents how in November 1993, the security forces burned about twenty of the three hundred houses in the village, because they were allegedly PKK sympathizers. After local elections in March 1994, approximately one third of the villagers from the """"Burukans"""" tribe became village guards and then forced all those who did not join to leave the village. By August 1994, most villagers in Nurettin who were not Burukans had been forced to flee, and their houses had been destroyed. Due to obstacles to reporting from the emergency region, the program of village destruction has gone underreported in the Turkish and world press. In July 1997, then Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced that 3,185 settlements had been completely or partially depopulated since fighting broke out in the region in August 1984. This has not been an orderly evacuation procedure, but a punitive measure, frequently conducted with considerable brutality, and villages are still being cleared. The exact number of displaced is unknown because no independent group has been able freely to conduct research in the region. In any case, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish villagers from the southeast have been displaced to shanty-towns throughout Turkey. Gendarmes who have been subject to PKK attack have frequently carried out reprisals - in some cases outright massacres - on any nearby villages that refused to join the village guard corps. In 1994 alone, more than a hundred people, mainly Kurdish villagers, """"disappeared"""" after being taken into custody by gendarmes or police. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the PKK itself committed many massacres of Kurdish men, women, and children in attacks on """"collaborator"""" villages. In """"Forced Displacement of Ethnic Kurds from Southeastern Turkey"""" (1994), Human Rights Watch documented numerous PKK raids on villages. In January 1994, for example, the PKK raided the villages of Akyurek and Ormancik in the Savur district, Mardin, and killed four village guards, six children, and nine women. In May 1994, during a raid on the village of Ebeduk in the Tercan district of Erzincan, the PKK killed nine individuals. Several examples are also given of villagers who were executed by the PKK. In July 1994, the PKK executed two alleged """"denouncers"""" in the village of Guzelagac. In September 1994, the PKK executed six teachers in Darikent village of the Mazgirt district of Tunceli. Parliamentary politics barred Meanwhile, attempts to organize and articulate the Kurdish identity through parliamentary politics have been consistently frustrated. Since 1971, every party that has explicitly voiced the need to tackle the problems of the Kurdish minority has been closed down as """"separatist"""" under Article 81 of the Law on Political Parties which forbids mention of racial or religious minorities. In the 1990s alone, eight political parties were shut down on these grounds. The People's Labor Party (HEP) and its successor parties have been subjected to relentless persecution by the state and its security forces for over a decade. HEP scored notable successes in the 1991 election, winning twenty-two parliamentary seats. However, when HEP deputies went to take up their parliamentary seats, there was a near-riot in the assembly. Leyla Zana, a HEP deputy, appeared wearing the """"Kurdish colours"""" (red, yellow and green) in her hair and announced in Kurdish that she was taking her parliamentary oath in Turkish under protest. Many of those enraged by this act mistakenly believed that these were the colours of the PKK. The Ankara State Prosecutor, who drew up the indictment against Zana, was among those who reacted strongly to the incident. As HEP began to be perceived as the political wing of the PKK, it became very dangerous to be a local HEP official. Brutal raids on the party's offices were carried out with monotonous regularity, and those detained were, almost without exception, tortured. Kurdish political leaders have also been murdered. Fifty-seven members and officials of HEP and its successors DEP and HADEP have been killed since 1991. In September 1993, the DEP parliamentary deputy Mehmet Sincar was shot dead in broad daylight. The killers were never arrested, and many believe the security forces were behind the killings. There is a good deal of evidence to support such a claim. Muhsin Melik, president of the Urfa branch of DEP, was attacked outside his office in Urfa in June 1994. Before he died, he made a statement in front of witnesses that he recognized his assailants as police officers who had been following him for some time. In March 1994, the Ankara State Security prosecutor began to intensify the legal assault on DEP, and party leaders Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak (among others) were arrested and put on trial as supporters of the PKK. After a trial that was a travesty of justice, and in spite of the fact that none of the four had ever been accused of participation in acts of violence, they were given sentences of fifteen years of imprisonment which they are currently serving at Ankara Closed Prison. HADEP, the successor to DEP, has suffered similar attacks. Its members have been prosecuted, often on trumped-up charges, and have faced police harassment, arbitrary detention, threats and torture, and even summary execution. Despite unsuccessful efforts to ban HADEP before the April 1999 elections, it scored a result comparable to its 1991 showing. Because the threshold for allocation had since been raised from 5 percent to 10 percent (largely in order to keep HADEP out of parliament), HADEP did not win seats in parliament. However, in local elections held the same day, HADEP won thirty-seven local offices. In spite of its often-repeated calls for peace and its public rejection of political violence, HADEP is widely perceived to be sympathetic to the PKK, an organization heartily detested by much of the Turkish public. Following the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Italy in November 1998, HADEP buildings were attacked by mobs. Two HADEP members died as a result of beatings in police custody. The Democratic Mass Party (DKP) -- which places a peaceful and democratic solution of the Kurdish question at the center of its program -- not only rejected political violence, but also strongly and publicly criticized the PKK for its methods. Nevertheless, the DKP was closed down by the Constitutional Court for """"separatism"""" in 1998, raising serious doubts about the possibility of establishing a party with a Kurdish discourse, no matter how moderate, that will be acceptable to the guardians of the Turkish state. Restrictions on the spoken and written word These parliamentary political parties were all closed down in spite of the fact that none of them ever proposed any territorial separation for Turkey's Kurds. Rather, they focused on cultural rights. Pressure in this area has achieved some small gains, but not sufficient to permit full and confident exercise of the Kurdish identity. For example, the traditional Kurdish new year festival of Nevruz was recognized as a public holiday in 1993, but scores of people attempting street celebrations in Istanbul and other cities were detained and held in police custody for several days, in some cases being subjected to torture and ill-treatment. The Kurdish language is naturally a key issue. It appears that the military junta of 1980 had intended to expunge the language altogether. In October 1983, it passed Law 2932, which specifically outlawed all communication in Kurdish without actually referring to the language explicitly. This law was repealed in 1991, probably as a result of the crisis in Iraq, which raised international awareness of the situation of Kurds. Now, although Kurdish is spoken more or less freely on the streets of Turkey's cities, its use is prohibited in education, politics, and the broadcast media. Education in languages other than Turkish is forbidden by the Constitution, but special dispensation can be made by the National Security Council (a body dominated by the military which """"advises"""" the civilian government). Instruction is currently permitted in English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese, but not Kurdish. A legally registered foundation, the Kurdish Cultural and Research Foundation (Kurt-Kav) fought a two-year battle to provide Kurdish language instruction at its headquarters in Istanbul, but the language course was declared illegal in May 1998. Radio or television broadcasting in languages other than Turkish is effectively barred by the 1994 RTUK broadcasting law. Nevertheless, the """"Kurdish reality"""" tends to leak through. Kurdish language music - provided that it is not overtly political - seems to be tolerated, and the army's southeastern radio station """"Voice of the Tigris"""" is sufficiently pragmatic, in trying to win the hearts and minds of the local population, to broadcast in the two main Kurdish dialects as well as Turkish and Turkmen. Interviews in Kurdish in news stories from southeastern Turkey are shown on national television with Turkish subtitles. Nevertheless, there are no legally operating radio or television stations with an explicitly Kurdish character, and attempts to found such networks have been shut down. Only a handful of small weekly newspapers or journals publish entirely or partly in Kurdish, even though there are no legal restrictions. Inevitably, magazines publishing in Kurdish tend to analyze the broader issues surrounding the Kurdish minority and will always come to the notice of at least the press prosecutor, and very likely the police Anti-Terror Branch. The fate of """"Hevi,"""" a bilingual Turkish-Kurdish weekly, is emblematic of the pressure such publications face. Hevi takes a moderate political line. Yet the majority of issues of Hevi have been confiscated on the grounds of allegedly separatist statements; criminal prosecutions have been brought against writers and the editor; and the editor currently faces an eighteen-month prison sentence, pending appeal. Most prosecutions relate to Turkish language articles rather than Kurdish ones. In fact, writing about Kurdish politics in any language is much more dangerous than merely writing in Kurdish. The Kurdish-owned daily Ozgur Gundem (Free Agenda) was published from May 1992 until it was closed on April 1994. In those two years, six of its reporters and twelve of its distributors were killed by assassins believed to be linked to the state. Two journalists """"disappeared"""" and one reporter remains confined to a wheelchair as a result of gunshot wounds that damaged his spine. Political journalism in southeast Turkey remains a dangerous profession. In November 1998 Mehmet Eren, a reporter for Hevi, was detained while covering a hunger strike at the HADEP headquarters in Diyarbakir. According to the May report of Reporters sans Frontieres, he was blindfolded and taken to the riot squad section of the city's police headquarters where his detention was only acknowledged after five days. He reported being stripped, threatened with rape, beaten on the testicles, and soaked with cold water. He was held incommunicado for nine days in all. As a result of the torture, he suffered a groin hernia. Police officers told him that he was being subjected to torture because he was """"putting out propaganda for the Kurds and working for a Kurdish newspaper.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye","Free Speech"

Ocalan's trial is scheduled to begin before the Ankara State Security Court on May 31, and will take place on the island of Imrali. Based on its observation of many State Security Court trials, Human Rights Watch believes that such a trial will almost certainly fall short of international standards. Indeed, the nine days of incommunicado detention imposed after Abdullah Ocalan's initial abduction, in addition to the intimidation and obstruction of his defense counsel, have already put the proceedings in doubt. State Security Courts are a creature of the military. Heirs to the infamous martial law courts, they were established under Article 143 of the constitution promulgated under the military junta in 1982 """"to deal with security offenses against the indivisible integrity of the State with its territory and nation, the free democratic order, or against the Republic whose characteristics are defined in the Constitution, and offenses directly involving the internal and external security of the State."""" Just as the constitution established a channel for military supervision of the government through the National Security Council, the influence the armed forces was built into the structure of the State Security Courts by placing one military judge together with two civilian judges on each court panel. The prosecutor may also be a serving army officer. The European Court of Human Rights, in its decision Incal vs Turkey (1998), concluded that the presence of a military judge in Turkey's State Security Courts was in violation of the principle of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, safeguarded by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In its verdict, the Court stated that: [T]he applicant could legitimately fear that because one of the judges of the Izmir National Security Court was a military judge it might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case...In conclusion, the applicant had legitimate cause to doubt the independence and impartiality of the Izmir National Security Court. There has accordingly be a breach of Article 6(1). In the intervening twelve months, no steps have been taken to address the concerns raised by the European Court of Human Rights. There are State Security Courts in eight cities in Turkey, dealing with thousands of cases brought under the Anti-Terror Law. The definition of """"terror"""" contained in this law is so broadly drawn that alongside cases of political arson and murder, a State Security Court may try respected politicians, journalists, human rights campaigners, and schoolchildren. Defendants branded as terrorists by conviction in State Security Courts include Recep Tayyip Erdogan, mayor of Istanbul, currently serving a ten-month sentence for quoting a poem that had been approved by the Ministry of Education but was deemed as provocation to religious hatred by the court, and Yasar Kemal, Turkey's most prominent novelist, arraigned for writing about the Kurdish minority in a German magazine. Violations of the defendant's rights begin from the first moment a person is arrested for any offense under the jurisdiction of a State Security Court. The Turkish Criminal Procedure Code provides that the defendant can be held without access to a lawyer for four days, during which time the defendant's next of kin are not even informed that he or she is in custody. The Turkish authorities simply ignore the calls by the United Nations and Council of Europe bodies for an end to incommunicado detention, as well as a number of judgments at the European Court of Human Rights that have ruled that such provisions are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. State Security Court prosecutors and judges exercise little or no supervision over the initial police interrogation, apparently preferring to give the police a free hand. As a consequence, police and gendarmerie often abuse detainees during the detention period. Almost without exception, State Security Court detainees emerge from police custody protesting that they have been subjected to ill-treatment or torture. Under the U.N. Convention against Torture, a court is required to investigate allegations that a statement has been extracted under duress. No statement found to have been made as a result of torture can be admitted as evidence against the person who made the statement. Nevertheless, State Security Court judges almost never initiate investigations into allegations of torture - even when the victims are able to show physical injuries to corroborate their claim - and routinely permit statements to be admitted into evidence that the defendant has retracted and has claimed were extracted under duress. Trials in State Security Courts are normally scheduled in a series of relatively brief hearings over the course of one or more years. Defense counsel is routinely relegated to an inferior position in the proceedings. While the prosecutor sits on the court podium next to the bench, the defense counsel is placed back in the body of the court. This junior position is strongly echoed in the conduct of State Security Court trials - defense counsel requests for evidence to be produced or for witnesses to be summoned are commonly ignored. The defense counsel has no right to cross-examine, but may suggest questions to the bench which then decides whether to address the questions to the witness. For many of those tried by State Security Courts -- those convicted of carrying out armed attacks on behalf of illegal political organizations -- the mandatory sentence is execution.

It urged both sides to abide by international humanitarian law particularly with regard to minimizing harm to civilians and ensuring that any prisoners captured are treated humanely.  Both sides have exchanged artillery fire across the cease-fire line — known as the Line of Control — that divides Indian-controlled Kashmir from that controlled by Pakistan. In addition, India has launched air strikes near the town of Kargil in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, close to the Line of Control.  """"The Kashmir conflict has produced far to many victims by all parties already,"""" said Patricia Gossman, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"Every new abuse will make one of the world's most dangerous conflicts even harder to resolve.""""  Human Rights Watch urged India and Pakistan to take urgent measures to ensure that civilian areas are not targeted and that their forces do not engage in indiscriminate fire or bombing that could cause unnecessary civilian deaths. As an important precaution, all military operations and installations should be located away from populated areas.  According to some reports, an Indian pilot was taken prisoner in Pakistan after his MIG-27 was shot down. The Geneva Conventions, to which both countries are party, require that people taking no part in the hostilities, including members of the armed forces who are captured or wounded, be treated humanely. Prisoners of war should be afforded the full extent of protection guaranteed under international law. Both Indian and Pakistani forces, and paramilitaries acting under their commands, have in the past been responsible for torture and summary execution. Such violations should be avoided at all cost.","Asia, India",""

The Cambodian government must decide within weeks whether to proceed with the trial of the two, who could face ten years in prison if convicted. Kim Sen and Meas Minear were arrested in December 1998 in connection with protests against the dumping of toxic waste in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. Detained for a month and then released, they were effectively accused of inciting the demonstrations, which turned violent. Human Rights Watch says the charges are groundless, and the two may have been targeted by a politicized court to pacify a powerful local politician whose house was vandalized by the protestors. """"Kim Sen and Meas Minear are the first Cambodian human rights defenders to face criminal charges since the creation of independent rights groups in 1992,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Their arrest and detention were bad enough, but if their trial goes forward, it could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly throughout the country."""" A subsidiary of the Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's largest private conglomerate, exported nearly 3,000 tons of mercury-contaminated industrial waste to Cambodia in late 1998. The shipment was dumped in an open field on the outskirts of Cambodia's southern port town of Sihanoukville, where poor local villagers scavenged the plastic coverings from the waste. Many villagers, as well as port workers who had unloaded the shipment, later complained of sickness; one port worker died but a lack of autopsy meant the cause of his death could not be established.  Amid widespread public outrage at the waste dumping, some Sihanoukville residents sought to exercise their constitutional rights. In December 1998, they held two days of public demonstrations, blaming government corruption for the presence of the toxic material. However, the demonstrations were not lawfully approved by the authorities and involved violence by some protesters, including the ransacking of several buildings. A six-week Human Rights Watch investigation has found that Kim Sen and Meas Minear are being prosecuted for actions that were well within their human rights mandate: they gave advice on human rights and the law to disgruntled local citizens and actively observed the demonstrations in order to monitor any human rights violations that might occur. As the late June 1999 deadline approaches for the Sihanoukville court to decide whether to proceed with a trial of Kim Sen and Meas Minear, Human Rights Watch urges the court to dismiss the charges for both lack of evidence and procedural violations of their rights. As for the toxic waste dumping which provoked the riots, Human Rights Watch notes that the two human rights workers were treated more harshly by the authorities than those government officials who have since been charged with committing crimes for their role in allowing the toxic waste to be imported. Human Rights Watch also expressed concern that the court investigation into the waste importation may be too limited to provide complete accountability for how the waste was allowed into Cambodia in the first place. The real test, therefore, will be whether ongoing investigations by the environment and finance committees of the National Assembly will be thorough and fully transparent. They should at least examine the serious allegations that high-level corruption was involved in the dumping decision.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Even people accused of the most heinous crimes, as Abdullah Ocalan is, have the right to a proper defense,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. """"Turkish law and international law both recognize this right. But it's time for the Turkish government to turn the principle into action."""" Cartner called on the Turkish government to make a public and unambiguous statement underlining the wholly legitimate role of defense counsel in the forthcoming proceedings. Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring organization based in New York. Since he was brought to Turkey on February 15, 1999, Ocalan's lawyers have not been permitted to bring even a paper and pencil to the few, brief interviews with their client that they have been allowed. Those interviews have been held within the hearing of masked security officials. The prosecution presented copies of the indictment to the press before giving it to defense lawyers. While attempting to conduct their duties, defense lawyers have been mobbed and physically attacked on several occasions, in some cases with the participation of the police. On May 25, Ocalan's main defense lawyer, Ahmet Zeki Okcuoglu, announced that he would not attend the trial due to limitations on the defense. He also urged all 105 attorneys not to attend the trial.  In November 1998, when Abdullah Ocalan first appeared in Italy, Human Rights Watch pressed Italian authorities to prosecute him for crimes against humanity committed by the PKK. At that time Human Rights Watch urged that he not be returned to Turkey, because of the substantial risk that he might be tortured and subjected to the death penalty. Abdullah Ocalan left Italy and was apprehended and transferred from Kenya to Turkey on February 15. He is currently awaiting trial at the prison island of Imrali near Istanbul. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited Abdullah Ocalan in early March and, though critical of the conditions of isolation imposed on the prisoner, reported that he was not at risk of physical ill-treatment.  Human Rights Watch called on the Turkish government to transfer Ocalan out of isolation. The practice of incommunicado detention, condemned by United Nations bodies and by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, persists in Turkey for those detained for offenses under state security court jurisdiction.  Ocalan will be tried before one of Turkey's state security courts, an institution that Human Rights Watch has vigorously opposed. State security courts frequently impose prison sentences for freedom of expression """"offenses."""" The highly respected journalist Oral Calislar was sentenced on May 19 to thirteen months of imprisonment for an interview he conducted with Abdullah Ocalan in 1993. Background information on state security courts is available here. On June 3, Akin Birdal, president of the Turkish Human Rights Association, will go to prison for a speech in which his crime was to refer to Turkey's Kurdish minority. Background information on Turkey's Kurdish minority is also available here. Turkey has not carried out a death sentence since 1984, although state security courts have meted out many of them. Human Rights Watch is concerned that Turkey will not sustain its moratorium on the death penalty if there is a conviction in the Ocalan trial. The Turkish parliament, which has the final decision on executions, would be under intense pressure from the military, as well as public passion and anger at the abuses committed in the fifteen years since the conflict with the PKK began. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in general and thus would oppose it in the Ocalan case.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Among the priorities listed by Human Rights Watch together with the Civil Liberties Organization and the Constitutional Rights Project, two leading Nigerian human rights groups, are the repeal of repressive military decrees, the release of the bodies of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his codefendants hanged in 1995, and the initiation of a transparent process to draft a new constitution.

While there are many pressing issues for your government to address, we are writing to you as national and international human rights organizations to bring to your attention several priority matters.   The lack of a democratically drafted constitution    The constitution that has finally been signed into law by General Abubakar is the product of a military government and an undemocratic process. We believe your government should treat this constitution as an interim document and should institute an immediate, inclusive, and transparent process for drafting a new constitution which will be legitimate in the eyes of all Nigerians.   Repeal of repressive decrees and general review of laws   Military decrees remain in force suspending constitutional guarantees of respect for fundamental human rights, allowing detention without trial, ousting the jurisdiction of the courts to examine executive acts, restricting freedom of expression, establishing military or special tribunals to try criminal offences without respect for international standards of due process and permitting other acts in violation of international human rights law. As an indication of your commitment to respect for human rights, we call on you to take immediate steps to repeal the most notorious decrees, including Decree No.2 of 1984, which allows indefinite detention without trial, and, in conjunction with the National Human Rights Commission and the nongovernmental human rights community, to institute a comprehensive process of review of the laws in force, with a view to the repeal or amendment of those that do not comply with the international human rights standards to which Nigeria is committed.   Recent detentions   Over the last few weeks, there have been a number of arrests of journalists and union leaders critical of the government. Lanre Arogundade, chairman of the Lagos State council of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) was arrested on April 25, and charged with the murder of Bolade Fasasi, a former official of the NUJ. There appears to be no evidence that Arogundade was in fact involved in the murder, and it seems that his arrest   may have been motivated rather by his campaigns for press freedom. Union leaders among civil servants have also been arrested and removed from their jobs. We urge you to order an immedate review of these cases, and in particular to ensure that the investigation of the murder of Fasasi is thorough and impartial and that the charges against Arogundade are dropped immediately if there is found to be no evidence implicating him in the murder.   The Ogoni trial   The trial and execution in November 1995 of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the eight other Ogoni activists has been condemned around the world, including by a factfinding mission sent by the U.N. Secretary-General, as in flagrant violation of international standards of due process. The bodies of the nine men have never been released to their families for proper burial; recently General Abubakar refused once again to respond to appeals to do so. As the victim yourself of a miscarriage of justice which sent you to prison for three years, we believe you should be quick to act to address these issues. In line with the findings and recommendations made by national and international monitoring bodies, we urge you to take immediate steps on taking office to issue a formal statement that the executions were a miscarriage of justice, to release the bodies of those hanged to their families, and to pay compensation as suggested by the U.N. Secretary-General's factfinding team. In addition, we urge you to appoint a judicial enquiry into the Ogoni crisis of 1993-98, including the murders of the four Ogoni leaders for whose deaths Ken Saro-Wiwa and his codefendants were hanged; to examine the human rights violations that were committed by members of the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force and others; and make recommendations for disciplinary or criminal proceedings against those responsible, compensation for the victims, and other measures of redress.   The situation in the Niger Delta   While the human rights situation in most of Nigeria has improved over the past nine months, the situation in the Niger Delta area has deteriorated. There has been increasing protest at oil company activity and federal government failure to listen to the demands of the peoples of the delta. In response, large numbers of soldiers have been deployed in the area, and have carried out serious and widespread violations of human rights, in particular in the course of a military crackdown in late December 1998 and early January 1999 which led to the deaths of dozens of young men, most of them unarmed. While protest has included criminal acts such as kidnappings of expatriate oil company staff, or violence against neighbouring ethnic groups, the appropriate response to such acts must be to arrest and prosecute those responsible, not to carry out indiscriminate reprisals against the entire population of the oil-producing regions.   We urge your administration to focus as a matter of urgency on the restoration of respect for human rights and the rule of law in the delta region. Among other steps, the government should appoint an independent judicial enquiry to investigate the human rights violations in the delta, including over the New Year period, and should discipline or prosecute those responsible, compensate the victims, and release or charge those who are still detained. In addition, your government should replace soldiers carrying out policing duties in the Niger Delta area and elsewhere with regular police with training in public order policing. We also urge you to institute an immediate, inclusive and transparent process of negotiation with freely chosen representatives of the peoples living in the Niger Delta to resolve the issues surrounding the production of oil.   Restoration of the justice system   Nigeria's court system is in a state of near-collapse. The police are responsible for widespread violations, including extrajudicial executions. Prison conditions are life-threatening. There is an urgent need to focus on these and other issues relating to the administration of justice, in conjunction with the national Human Rights Commission and the human rights community in Nigeria, as well as international agencies who can give technical assistance, in order to help restore respect for human rights and the rule of law - respect that is essential not only for the rights of the Nigerian people, but also to promote the sort of external investment that will be necessary to bring Nigeria out of its current economic crisis.   Problems with the electoral process   Although most international and domestic observers of the local, state and federal elections in Nigeria welcomed their peaceful completion as an important step forward in the return of Nigeria to civilian government, they also noted serious flaws in the process at all stages. These irregularities included inflated figures for voter turnout, stuffing of ballot boxes, intimidation and bribery of both electoral officials and voters, and alteration of results at collation centres. These irregularities were widespread, but were particularly serious in the South-South zone of the country, the Niger Delta region. In addition, money clearly played a dominant role at the party primaries, including the presidential primary of the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP). We urge you to work with national and international organizations in order to ensure that the next elections held in Nigeria do represent a more genuine process.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/05/26/hrw-letter-president-egypt","HRW - Letter to President of Egypt","HRW - Letter to President of Egypt","","05/26/1999","Human Rights Watch is writing to express its deep dismay at the People's Assembly vote last night to approve the draft Law on Associations and Civil Institutions, an extremely significant piece of legislation that provides the legal framework for monitoring and regulation of the operations of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt. As explained below, several provisions of the law constitute unnecessary or unreasonable interference with the right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Egypt has ratified. We respectfully appeal to Your Excellency to use your power under Article 113 of the Constitution and refer this draft law back to the People's Assembly within the next month. We furhter recommend that, with this referral, you publicly encourage parliamentarians to undertake a full and open discussion of the law's controversial provisions, and urge that as part of this process they formally and seriously solicit comment and opinions from a wide range of Egyptian NGOs, civil society experts, and human rights advocates so that the questionable articles of the law will be satisfactorily modified or cancelled. Our first concern with the law is that it contains overly broad language that can be used arbitrarily to deny legal status to any of the country's existing or emerging NGOs. Article 11 prohibits the establishment of associations whose purposes or activities """"threaten national unity"""" or """"violate public order or moral codes."""" The executive branch of government is granted the power (in Article 6) to deny legal status to any NGO on the basis of the ministry of social affairs' interpretation of this vaguely worded language. While these provisions appear to echo permitted restrictions of the right to freedom of association under international human rights law, in fact they are not the same. """"National unity,"""" for example, is a more elastic concept than """"national security,"""" which involves a threat to the life of the nation, and in whose interest a state may argue that certain restrictions on freedom of association are justified. Allowing authorities to deny legal status to NGOs in the name of national unity -- a vague term which may easily be wielded against critics of the government or minority groups -- only opens the door to abuse of discretion and arbitrary actions. Article 11 also bans NGOs from """"practicing any political or unionist activities restricted to political parties and trade [and professional] unions,"""" and permits the denial of legal status for this reason. This provision has raised concern in Egypt, which we share, because it does not take into account the overlap in some aspects of the work carried out by independent political parties, trade and professional unions, and NGOs. To cite only one example, Article 11 could be invoked to deny legal status to human rights organizations that provide legal aid, an activity which authorities might view as duplicative of the work of bar associations, one type of professional union in Egypt. In such cases, it should be the role of the various organizations of civil society, not the state, to determine such activities are undertaken. We note with deep concern that Article 75 of the draft law subjects violators of Article 11 to criminal penalities, including a LE10,000 fine and up to one year in prison. In addition, Article 42 states that grounds for dissolution of an NGO include committing """"a grave violation of the law, public order or ethics""""or """"if it is revealed that [an NGO's] real aims included, or it has practiced, activities which are prohibited"""" in Article 11 of the law. The extremely elastic language gives potentially wide discretion to authorities to harass any NGO with legal action. Moreover, Article 42 permits courts, if so requested, to """"order within three days an immediate cessation of the activity while the request to dissolve [the NGO] is being discussed.""""  The law unreasonably gives to the state the power to interfere with the structure and internal management of independent NGOs. Article 34 requires that the executive branch be notified of the names of the candidates for membership on boards of directors, sixty days prior to board elections. It further stipulates that """"the administrative authority and any interested party"""" can challenge any of these candidates """"for not fulfilling conditions for nomination."""" If the nomination of an objectionable candidate is not withdrawn, the matter must then be referred first to a special non-judicial local committee created pursuant to Article 7 of the law. The committee's decision can be appealed to the local court of first instance. The selection of members of any organization's board of directors should be a matter for the membership to decide in a democratic manner, without interference from the state or other parties.  The law also grants to the executive branch the power to control the ability of NGOs to associate freely with foreign organizations, and seek funding from abroad or send funds abroad. Article 16 states that NGOs must notify the executive branch of intentions to """"join, participate in or affiliate with a club, association, institution or organization based outside the Arab Republic of Egypt, whose activities are not incompatible with its purposes."""" Within a sixty-day period after such notification, the executive branch is empowered to object in writing to any proposed link between an Egyptian NGO and a counterpart abroad. Article 17 prohibits NGOs from receiving funds """"from a foreign person or agency,"""" or sending """"any funds to persons or organizations abroad"""" without the permission of the executive branch, with the sole exception of """"proceeds from selling books and scientific and technical publications and journals."""" These provisions cripple the autonomy and independence of NGOs, and represent excessive state interference in organizational decision making and management. If an NGO violates either article, Article 42 of the law authorizes the executive branch to seek the organization's dissolution by court judgment. Human Rights Watch is also deeply concerned that the law authorizes the imprisonment of Egyptians who might peacefully exercise the right to freedom of association and yet run afoul of the law's restrictive and unreasonable provisions. For example, a minimum of ten persons is required in order to apply for permission to establish an NGO (Article 1). This provision denies smaller groups of activists the right to form organizations and seek legal status. Article 75 of the law prescribes a maximum of six months imprisonment and a fine of LE2,000 for anyone who: establishes an entity that carries out any NGO activities without following the provisions of the law; undertakes NGO activities after a court has ordered the activities to cease or the organization to be dissolved; or in the capacity as a head or members of an NGO receives funding from abroad, sends funds abroad, or undertakes fundraising without the permission of the executive branch of government. The state should encourage and facilitate the growth of independent NGOs in Egypt, and not institute new measures that might criminalize peaceful activity and place local activists behind bars. Last, the law creates new local administrative mechanisms that deny individuals affiliated with NGOs the right to challenge immediately in a court of law any decision of the executive branch that affects the operation or management of their organizations (Article 7). In each jurisdiction of a court of first instance, the law provides for the creation of one or more non-judicial committees, established by the minister of justice and chaired by a judge of the appeal court or higher, which """"shall have the competence to adjudicate on disputes that may arise between the [NGO] and the administrative authority."""" In addition to the judge, each committee will have three other members: a representative nominated by the ministry of social affairs, a representative nominated by the chair of the General Federation of Associations, and a representative of the affected NGO. Article 7 further provides: """"Disputes should in the first instance be submitted to the committee before resorting to the competent court, otherwise the lawsuit shall be dismissed. Appeals against the committee's decisions can be lodged with the competent court within sixty days in accordance with the established legal procedure."""" There are reasons for concern that the structure of this unique addition to Egypt's legal system will allow the committees to be government-controlled, and that this mechanism could be used to entangle NGOs in time-consuming administrative processes prior to direct court review of executive branch decisions.  The new NGO law in Egypt should be a progressive document that will serve as a model for the country and the region. As such, members of parliament should be encouraged to craft legislation that maximizes the ease with which citizens can exercise the right to freedom of association and affords NGOs the space and flexibility to carry out their activities as autonomous and independent actors in civil society, with a minimum of government interference in their affairs.  Once again, Human Rights Watch calls again on Your Excellency not to ratify this law but to send it back to parliament for wider consultation with those who will be most affected by its passage, and to amend or annul its unreasonable and highly restrictive provisions. Thank you in advance for your attention to this most important matter.

The draft law restricts the right of freedom to association as guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It is a cause for serious concern that it provides a set of criminal penalties, including a maximum sentence of one year in prison, for offenses that might amount to no more than the exercise of freedom of association,"""" the six groups said. The text, which has yet to be ratified by the Egyptian president, would give the authorities far-reaching controls over non-governmental organizations' (NGO) activities, including the work of Egyptian human rights groups. The draft provisions impose a wide range of restrictive conditions on the management, operations and financing of NGOs and will allow authorities to control relations at the international level, activities at local level, funding from abroad and composition of boards of directors. Under the new law, NGOs will be required to receive prior approval from the authorities in order to join or affiliate with an organization abroad, and violators will face up to three months imprisonment. Other violations of the law, such as activities that """"threaten the national unity,"""" bring prison sentences of up to one year .  This draft law is flagrantly at odds with the letter and spirit of the UN Human Rights Defenders Declaration. The Declaration, adopted by the General Assembly in December 1998, recognizes the rights and responsibilities of human rights defenders and requires governments to create an environment in which they can work without interference and harassment. Over the past 18 months, Egypt's human rights community has campaigned against restrictive measures in various drafts of the law, and also provided advice and expertise during the government's protracted drafting process. However, human rights activists and other NGOs have vigorously complained that their recommendations and reservations have been ignored by the authorities. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (LCHR), the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) appeal to the Egyptian President: not to ratify the draft law; to refer the draft back to Parliament for revision and to encourage parliamentarians to undertake a full and open discussion of the law's controversial provisions; to ensure that legal provisions regulating NGOs will contribute to improve the framework for human rights work in conformity with international standards and not impose or maintain restrictive conditions.  Background The proposed new Law on Civil Associations and Institutions would replace the existing Law 32 of 1964 regulating NGOs in Egypt. However, under Law 32 of 1964 human rights organizations, in particular, have faced difficulties in obtaining registration. For example, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights has continued to operate """"in formation"""" since it was founded in 1985. Other human rights activists have resorted to founding non-profit companies as a legal umbrella for their activities. The new law requires existing institutions to register within six months of the new regulations coming into force. Under the new law, NGOs must receive prior approval by the authorities for several activities, including conducting board elections (Article 34) and joining an organization outside Egypt (Art 16). Board members face up to three months imprisonment if they arrange for an NGO to join an organization abroad without prior permission (Article 75). If an NGO fails to seek permission before joining an organization abroad, the authorities can initiate the dissolution of that NGO under procedures laid down in Article 42. Imprisonment for up to six months is prescribed for any member of an NGO receiving or sending money abroad or collection of donations without prior permission from the authorities (Article 75). The engagement in """"any political or unionist activities restricted to political parties, trade unions and professional associations (niqabat)"""" is prohibited and can lead to imprisonment of up to one year (Article 11, Article 75). Under such vague provisions, NGO activities, in particular in the field of civil rights, can be banned or might even lead to imprisonment. On 9 December 1998, the UN General Assembly adopted the """"Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms"""" -- commonly referred to as the """"Human Rights Defenders Declaration."""" The Ministerial Conference on Human Rights, held by the Organization of African Unity in Mauritius in April 1999, urged African governments to take appropriate steps to implement the Declaration.

In recent months these promising words have been contradicted by a worrying trend in harassment of the opposition and the independent media. The government's track record on respect of human rights since the last Consultative Group meeting has shown that the attaching of clear benchmarks on human rights can encourage improvements (such as the ratification of the Convention against Torture) but that human rights remain generally poorly respected in Zambia and that bilateral donors should continue to place human rights conditions on their balance of payments support packages to the Zambian government in order to clearly signal their concern about continued human rights abuses and through these benchmarks encourage the government to make further improvements in its respect for human rights.  Zambia, once promoted as a model for democracy in Africa, has been distinguished by a pattern of on going human rights abuses by government officials against the independent media and the opposition in the wake of a military coup attempt on October 28, 1997 when soldiers seized the national radio station in the government's Mass Media Complex.(1) A few hours later Zambia army commandos stormed the complex, regained control, and captured the rebel soldiers. The following day, a state of emergency was declared by President Chiluba and a crackdown ensued on suspected accomplices in the coup attempt and leaders of the legal opposition.

Last week, as the trial of Tunisian prominent human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui approached, human rights lawyers and activists were put under further pressure. The trial of Radhia Nasraoui and her 20 co-defendants, accused of links with an unauthorized association and participation in unauthorized meetings, has attracted wide attention both in Tunisia and abroad. Some 20 foreign lawyers and several foreign diplomats attended the trial on 15 May and some 120 Tunisian lawyers were present for the defence. However, having deliberately failed to bring three of the defendants from prison to the courtroom, the Tunisian authorities postponed the trial using their absence as a pretext. The authorities have often employed such tactics to postpone a trial in an attempt to inconvenience international observers and prevent them from attending hearings. On 24 May 1999, Taoufik Ben Brik, a journalist and member of the Conseil national pour les libertés en Tunisie, CNLT (National Council for Liberties in Tunisia), was arrested and detained for several hours for interrogation. The previous week, on 20 May he was attacked outside his home in Tunis in broad daylight by three individuals armed with chains . In the preceding weeks, he had been prevented from leaving the country and had his passport confiscated. His wife, Azza, had her car windows smashed as she was shopping with their two young children. These incidents appear to be the result of a number of articles he had recently published in France and Switzerland in which he strongly criticized the deterioration in the human rights situation and the increasing lack of public liberties and press freedom in Tunisia. The CPJ joins the other organizations in expressing concerns for his safety. Human rights lawyers and activists have recently come under further pressure. Omar Mestiri, secretary-general of the CNLT, was arrested on 12 May 1999 at his home in Tunis. He was detained until the following evening in the Ministry of the Interior and was questioned about his activities within the CNLT, which was set up on 10 December 1998 but was refused authorization by the Tunisian authorities last March. The previous day the CNLT had issued an appeal condemning the arrest of 10 senior members of the Union générale tunisienne du travail, UGTT (General Union of Tunisian Workers). These trade unionists were arrested and held for two days in the Ministry of the Interior following a petition they and others had issued condemning interference by the authorities in the affairs of the UGTT. On 22 May Mohamed Tahar Chaieb, another leading trade unionist and university lecturer, was arrested at Tunis airport upon returning from Paris. He was detained for two days in the Ministry of the Interior and was interrogated about his contacts with media, human rights organizations and trade unions abroad. In recent weeks the CNLT has issued several statements expressing concern at the poor human rights situation and increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and association in Tunisia. Several members of the CNLT, as well as many other human rights defenders and lawyers have recently had their telephone lines cut and have had their passports confiscated. Police surveillance, a regular feature in the daily life of many human rights defenders, has recently increased and a number of lawyers and human rights defenders, including members of the CNLT, of the Association Tunisienne des Femmes Démocrates, ATFD (Tunisian Association of Democratic Women), and of the Ligue Tunisienne des Droits de l'Homme, LTDH (Tunisian Human Rights League), report being constantly followed. Dozens of other human rights defenders and their relatives have been targeted by the authorities. LTDH vice-president Khemais Ksila, detained since September 1997, continues to serve a three-year prison sentence for issuing a communique criticizing the human rights situation in Tunisia. His wife and children have been continually harassed and recently his 11-year-old son was prevented from leaving the country to go to Egypt to receive a human rights award on behalf of his father. Human rights lawyer Najet Yaqoubi, a member of the ATFD, is constantly followed by police and her home and office are under surveillance. Human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui has been prevented from leaving the capital since March 1998 and was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment, suspended, last February for leaving the capital to attend the funeral of her mother-in-law. Her children have been intimidated by security forces on several occasions. Human rights lawyer Najib Hosni is prevented from working, his telephone has been disconnected and he is one of more than 25 lawyers who are refused a passport. Mohamed Bedoui, brother of former LTDH President and current CNLT spokesperson Moncef Marzouki, was imprisoned last March and is now serving a six-month prison sentence for refusing to be comply with an order to report to police daily. Dr. Moncef Marzouki cannot obtain a passport and his telephone has also been disconnected.  AI, the CPJ, the FIDH, Human Rights Watch, the LCHR, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, the OMCT, and RSF are gravely concerned by recent developments in Tunisia, notably the increasingly frequent and serious incidents of intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders and of those who seek to exercise their right to freedom of expression and association. The organizations call on the Tunisian authorities to: *Put an immediate end to the harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists and trade unionists and lift current restrictions imposed on them and ensure that their telephone and fax lines be restored and they be allowed to enjoy their right to freedom of expression, association and movement inside and outside the country; *ensure that human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists and trade unionists and their families be protected and be allowed to carry out their human rights activities without interference, intimidation and persecution; *release LTDH Vice-President Khemais Ksila immediately and unconditionally and drop all charges against human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui and her co-defendants; *ensure that a prompt and full investigation be carried out into the attack against Taoufik Ben Brik and that those responsible for the attack be brought to justice.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

Balance of payments support was suspended by a number of governments in 1996 because of human rights abuses committed by the Zambian government. Since then, balance of payments support has been tied to a number of conditions, including human rights. On May 27-28, 1999, the Consultative Group will discuss what types of conditions should remain.  """"We expected improvements in the government's rights record since last May's consultative group meeting,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the executive director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"Instead, there is a growing pattern of harassment against the independent media and the opposition.""""  In a sixteen-page memorandum presented to donors today, Human Rights Watch documents the government's crackdown on the independent media and the opposition. At the end of the last Consultative Group meeting in May 1998, the head of the Zambian government delegation, Edith Nawakwi, Minister of Finance and Economic Development, stated that """"the government wants a clean and good human rights record. We are a leader in the liberation struggles of southern Africa. We want to be a leader on human rights.""""  Human Rights Watch's research in Zambia since the last Consultative Group meeting has shown that despite the Minister's fine words, Zambia is far from being a ‘leader of human rights.' In March 1999, the Zambian government moved against the independent Post newspaper, charging twelve journalists with espionage in an effort to suppress legitimate debate on a matter of public interest, the crisis in bilateral relations with Angola. Opposition political parties have also come under intense government scrutiny. The government uses bureaucratic obstacles to inhibit opposition campaigns, and uses the Zambia Revenue Authority to intimidate opposition leaders and supporters.  Former President of Zambia and opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) leader Kenneth Kaunda has also been harassed. On March 31, 1999 Kaunda found his nationality questioned in a court judgment on a petition filed by ruling party supporters. Government officials in their efforts to undermine, intimidate and silence the opposition have also increasingly questioned the ethnic origins of their critics, as a way of possibly denying them citizenship. The nationality of many of these individuals had been recognized without challenge from the inception of the Zambian state in 1964 until the current government identified them as opposition.  Kaunda's car was also shot at and damaged on March 31, 1999 by an unidentified gunman outside his residence in Lusaka. Human Rights Watch has examined the car and the scene of the incident and is in no doubt that an assault rifle was used and that several shots were fired. A police inquiry into this shooting has not made its findings public.  """"We too want to see Zambia as a leader in Africa on human rights,"""" said Takirambudde.

This is the second time since 1998 that the government of Thailand has bowed to pressure by its authoritarian neighbors and attempted to prevent an international meeting on human rights.  In March 1998, police attempted to restrict the participation of about one hundred international human rights advocates in a five-day seminar on East Timor in Bangkok, saying the foreign participants would violate Thai law if they spoke out against Indonesia. This time, the ban appears to have been linked to the European Union-ASEAN summit, with Burma in attendance, that is scheduled to take place in Bangkok at the same time as the cancelled trade union meeting. In addition to cancelling the meeting, the Thai authorities also refused to grant an entry visa to Dr. Sein Win of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB).  These actions run contrary to Foreign Minister Surin's position that ASEAN members should be free to criticize actions of other countries in the region. They also call into question Thailand's stated commitment to the internationally recognized rights of free association, assembly, and expression.

In the regions of Port Loko and Masiaka, approximately 30 miles northeast of Freetown, Human Rights Watch has taken testimonies of survivors who describe decapitations, amputation of hands, mouths and ears, and scores of abductions of children and women by the RUF rebels.   """"The world is captivated by the suffering in Kosovo,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"Meanwhile, what's happening in Sierra Leone is unspeakable. Where is the global outrage?""""   While these atrocities are the most serious since the January 1999 rebel offensive against Freetown, it is consistent with a long standing pattern of human rights abuses committed against the civilian population by rebel groups, and also by Sierra Leonean government forces and their surrogates.   """"Human rights has to be at the top of the agenda when the parties begin their peace talks on Monday,"""" said Takirambudde. He urged the international community to put pressure on the rebel and government negotiators to stop the crimes against humanity. Peace talks are scheduled to begin Monday, May 18, in Lomé, Togo.   Human Rights Watch has taken testimony from residents of the villages of Madigba, Masimra, Ropart, Mangarma, Msumana and Magbany. One man interviewed in Freetown on May 13 described an attack on the village of Madigba in which 12 civilians, including seven of his own young children, were hacked to death in the early morning of May 11. He told Human Rights Watch:   They entered our village at around 3:00 am and set upon us, accusing us of hiding ECOMOG soldiers[West African peacekeepers] and Kamajors [civilian defense forces] They went house to house, stealing everything, and started attacking us with axes and machetes. I grabbed two of my children and ran into the bush to hide and when I came back a few hours later I saw that eleven people had been killed. Only one of my nieces was still alive but her head was split open and she died this morning in the hospital.   From his hospital bed on May 14 one of these villagers, I.K. told Human Rights Watch:   A group of over l00 rebels caught me and my friend M. in the bush as we were trying to flee. They brought us to the village of Mangarma, where I saw over 40 civilians from several surrounding villages being held at gunpoint by the rebels. They were mostly women and children. I think the men were able to get away. They forced the women and children to go into two houses. Over the next two hours I saw the rebels killing at least 20 people. At around 2:00 pm they brought five women from inside a house who they forced to take off their clothes and lay on the ground. Then three rebels cut their throats and hacked them to death with machetes. They placed one of the women's heads on a stick and put it at the entrance to the village. The rebels then called me and told me to say good-bye to my people. I begged them not to kill me so they cut off both of my hands and told me to run and tell ECOMOG they were soon coming to Port. Loko. I ran but from where I was hiding in the bush I could see at least four rebels taking children out of the houses and killing them with knives and machetes. They killed eight children, I counted them.   A 27-year-old teacher interviewed in a Freetown hospital said rebels cut off both of his arms with an axe. He described seeing five people, including two children, executed by the rebels. In an interview on May 12, he told Human Rights Watch:   When we heard the rebels were coming we fled into the bush but were soon set upon by a group of seven of them. The rebels grabbed the children from their mothers' arms -- one was just an infant and the other was about three -- and bayoneted them to death before killing the two women with machetes. Then they killed the old man. The commander who gave the order said they had no use within their ranks. The rebels then walked me to the Masiaka-Waterloo highway where they cut off both my hands. First they cut off my right hand with a rusty axe I begged them to leave my other hand because I'm left handed, but they cut it anyway. They then told me to go to ECOMOG and tell them the rebels were around.   Several other survivors describe atrocities being committed in at least four villages near Port Loko, which were all attacked in the morning and afternoon hours of May 7. Human Rights Watch took testimonies from four civilians, including a 15-year-old girl, who was one of three people in one family whose two hands were all amputated by an axe in a rebel attack on the town of Mangarma.   Seven survivors interviewed by Human Rights Watch spoke of having witnessed abductions of family members by the RUF forces. According to testimonies taken, the majority of those abducted were young women and children. One woman from Masampa village near Masiaka gave the names of five children between nine and 15 who were abducted by the rebels during an assault on their village in late April.   All the witnesses interviewed described widespread looting of property and burning of houses by the rebel forces during the attacks on villages. Those whose villages had been occupied by the rebels also described a pattern of forced labor and intimidation.   Human Rights Watch noted that the rebel actions constituted crimes against humanity, among the most serious international crimes.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice"

The Bill places enormous restrictions on NGO and voluntary work in Egypt. It gives the Executive Branch control over the activities, membership, and funding of associations, and ignores repeated criticism put forward by development associations and human rights organizations. This Bill is the latest in a series of restrictive measures carried out by the government that have left most professional syndicates paralysed (Law 100/1993), confined political parties to their premises, and deprived them of the right to undertake any public activities (Law 40/1977). Journalists have also not been spared: after their struggle to repeal Law 93/1995, the past year has witnessed the imprisonment of four journalists for the first time since 1952, the closure of independent newspapers, bans on printing some newspapers and magazines, and the right to publish newspapers has been further restricted by Law 3/1998, requiring the Cabinet of Ministers' approval for any new licenses. The Emergency Law, in force since October 1981, has in practice become a new constitution. Furthermore, the Bill will be voted on by a parliament that is impossible to consider legitimate. The present parliament came to power through the worst elections ever held in the modern history of Egypt: the court of Cassation reports on the irregularities of those elections provide only one of the many proofs of this. The Bill, when placed in the current political context, is merely a reflection of the government's general intention to restrict further any form of independent association, be it political parties, unions, professional syndicates, or NGOs. The undersigned organizations call on the President of the Republic, in his capacity as the head of the Executive Branch, and the leader of the ruling party that controls over 90 percent of the People's Assembly, to start his fourth term in office with a declaration of democratic reforms. Furthermore, the undersigned organizations call on the President of the Republic to consider immediately the following: Lifting the State of Emergency Halting all procedural and legal restrictions that have resulted in professional syndicates effectively becoming paralysed Halting the use of custodial penalties in cases involving journalists accused of libel and defamation, and other offences related to their work, and the drafting of new press laws to replace the current ones, with the assistance of the Journalists Syndicate Removing all obstacles facing the activities of political parties, and allowing the establishment of new political parties Instructing the Ministry of the Interior to stop the use of torture immediately, and ordering the Prosecutor General to investigate independently all torture allegations and bring those involved in such criminal activities to a speedy trial Reconsidering the expected inauguration of the Bill on Associations and Private Institutions, and open a discussion that considers different proposals put forward by civil society and human rights organizations.

He has taken a step in the right direction by recognizing the need to lower the highest sentences imposed under the current laws and to increase the number of addicted defendants placed in drug treatment programs. Much more is needed, however. The legislation the governor has proposed fails to address the core problem with New York's current laws--the over-incarceration of low-level offenders, resulting from mandatory minimums, an excessively harsh sentencing structure keyed solely to the weight of the drug involved, and the ability of prosecutors to wield far too much power over the sentencing of individual defendants. The limitations in the governor's proposal reflect an unwillingness to acknowledge the extent to which low-level nonviolent drug offenders are incarcerated. The announcement of Pataki's proposed reforms was accompanied by publication of a report, """"Narrow Pathways to Prison: The Selective Incarceration of Repeat Drug Offenders in New York State,"""" by Katherine Lapp, the state's director of criminal justice. In this report, Ms. Lapp contends the state is """"very selective"""" in its use of prison for drug offenders and that those who are sentenced to prison deserve to be there. Lapp's conclusions are surprising, given that her data shows that 3,226 drug offenders were incarcerated in 1998 even though they were either first offenders or had previously been convicted only of nonviolent drug offenses. Human Rights Watch believes the discussion of drug policy reform is best served by an understanding of the relevant facts. Unfortunately, """"Narrow Pathways"""" offers a limited amount of data, much of it presented in a misleading fashion. We therefore offer some fact-based responses to Lapp's claims and provide some additional relevant information on drug offenders crucial to an informed drug sentencing debate. Claim: Few first-time felony drug arrestees receive prison sentences. Reality: 1,526 men and women with no prior felony arrests or convictions were incarcerated for drug offenses in 1998. One in seven (14%) of convicted first time drug arrestees were incarcerated. Lapp contends their incarceration rate was only 9.8% through a statistical sleight-of-hand: she compared the number of those sent to prison against the number initially arrested. The relevant measure, however, is how many first offenders convicted of a nonviolent drug offense are sent to prison. Claim:  Many first offenders were incarcerated because they committed serious drug offenses, as shown by their arrest charges for Class A and B felonies. Reality: Most incarcerated first offenders were convicted of low-level drug offenses. At the end of 1998, there were 6,382 men and women in prison for drug offenses sentenced as first offenders. Of these, 624 were convicted of Class A-1 felonies, 1,899 of Class A-2, 2,153 of Class B, and 1,706 of Classes C-E. Arrest charges do not reflect the seriousness of a defendant's conduct. In drug cases police routinely make arrests on the highest possible charges. This permits the prosecutors to bargain for information and guilty pleas in exchange for lower charges and lower sentences. For example, drug offenders suspected of being involved in street-level drug sales of small drug amounts are routinely arrested on Class B charges and then are convicted of Class C or D level crimes. Class A or B offenses are not limited to dangerous criminal conduct. Anyone who participates, however tangentially and in however minor a capacity, in the sale of two ounces of drugs or who possesses as little as four ounces, can be convicted of a Class A offense. Possession of half an ounce of drugs or the sale of any amount, however minute, constitutes a Class B offense. Claim: Few drug arrestees whose prior criminal histories are limited to drug felonies (""""drug-only"""" offenders) receive prison sentences. Reality: 1,700 """"drug-only"""" offenders went to prison for nonviolent drug crimes in 1998. Two out of five, or 40%, of the drug-only offenders are incarcerated. Lapp states their incarceration rate is 30% because she compares the number of those sent to prison against those arrested. As noted above, however, the relevant measure is the number of convicted drug-only offenders sent to prison. But even Lapp's figure of 30%, or one in three, is remarkably high for a population that is nonviolent and consists primarily of low-level offenders. Claim: The second-felony offender law is not primarily responsible for the incarceration of repeat drug offenders. Reality: The basis for this claim is inexplicable. The second-felony offender law explicitly requires the incarceration of felony offenders with prior felony convictions. Lapp herself states that 72% of the 1996 arrestees with prior drug crimes had previously served prior probation or prison terms, i.e., had prior convictions for felonies. Claim:  The seriousness of the drug offense for which defendants were arrested helps explain the incarceration of """"drug-only"""" repeat offenders. Reality: Most incarcerated """"drug-only"""" repeat offenders were convicted of the lowest level drug crimes. According to the Department of Correctional Services, 15,922 people in New York prisons at the end of 1998 had been sentenced as second felony drug offenders. Only 1% were convicted of class A crimes. Repeat Drug Offenders in Prison Felony Class Number Percentage A-II 236 1% B 4,312 27% C-E 11,456 72% The Path to Prison Data from the Department of Correctional Services and the Division of Criminal Justice Services shows that the road to prison for drug offenders is a broad highway and not--as Lapp erroneously contends --a """"narrow pathway."""" Fact:  Thousands of low-level drug offenders are incarcerated each year.   As of December 31, 1998, there were 22,386 men and women in New York prisons convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. One in four was convicted of possessing drugs. Fifty-nine percent of the incarcerated drug offenders, 13,612 people, were convicted of sales or possession offenses in the three lowest felony classes--Class C, D or E. These felonies involve minute drug amounts. Fact: Thousands of drug offenders who have not engaged in violent, serious or dangerous criminal conduct are sent to prison each year. -Three out of four (77.5%) drug offenders sent to prison have never been convicted of a violent felony. - One in three (31.8%) has no prior felony conviction for any crime. - Half (50.9%) have no prior felony drug convictions. - Half were people whose only prior criminal conduct--whether detected or undetected by law enforcement agencies--consisted of low-level nonviolent drug-related offenses.(1) - Only 9.7% have prior convictions for both drug and violent felonies. The Lapp report chronicles the criminal history of forty representative cases of men and women arrested in 1996 for drug offenses. Many had multiple arrests and convictions on misdemeanor as well as felony drug charges, as well as histories of failing to comply with the terms of pretrial release and/or probation. Their stories illustrate a well known fact about the current criminal justice system: it functions as a turnstile operation through which thousands of minor drug offenders spin without receiving adequate supervision or any drug treatment. Sooner or later, many end up as second felony offenders sent to prison at great cost to themselves, their families, their communities and the state. ***** 1. John J.

In the open letter, issued on the third anniversary of the announcement of the human rights plan, the New York-based group called for immediate action to curb abuses, particularly summary executions and torture by police, and to remedy abysmal prison conditions.

More than two hundred Brazilian and international human rights organizations participated in the drafting of the rights plan, the first of its kind in the Americas.

The plan, known by its Portuguese acronym """"PNDH"""" (Programa Nacional de Direitos Humanos or National Human Rights Program) seeks to fulfill commitments made by the world's governments at the 1993 United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.  The PNDH was designed as a blueprint for action, including 227 proposed measures. Yet without a time frame for implementation, the vast majority of its measures remain a dead letter. For all but a few reforms, there is no anticipated date for implementation.  Police torture and killings, prison massacres, debt bondage, deadly land conflicts, murder of indigenous peoples, domestic violence, impunity for the crimes of the military dictatorship remain prevalent in Brazil. The Human Rights Watch letter to Cardoso addresses each of these seven areas of persistent abuse, highlighting measures needed to respond to each. """"Brazil took the lead in Latin America when it released its human rights plan in 1996,"""" said Vivanco. """"But the plan alone is not enough to stop police killings, torture, prison massacres, and rural killings. Vigorous and determined actions are now needed to make this plan a reality.""""

Human Rights Watch addresses country specific issues through our regional divisions: Africa; Americas; Asia; Middle East; and Europe and Central Asia. The Americas division, formerly Americas Watch, was founded in 1981 and has been monitoring human rights conditions in Brazil since 1987, the year in which we published Police Abuse in Brazil: Summary Executions and Torture in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 1994, we established an office in Rio de Janeiro.     In March 1995, shortly after you began your first term as President of Brazil, we wrote to present our vision of the challenges facing your administration in the area of human rights. Human Rights Watch identified seven areas of human rights abuse plaguing Brazil: police brutality, including off-duty official violence, particularly that directed against adolescents; abysmal prison conditions including massacres in detention centers; rural violence including the targeted killing of agrarian leaders; forced labor and debt bondage; violence against indigenous peoples; violence against women, including forced prostitution; and finally, the lack of justice in cases of """"disappearances"""" and political assassinations committed during the military dictatorship.     These seven themes represent the principal areas in which Human Rights Watch has documented abuses in Brazil during the past twelve years. Because of their prevalence, these abuses provide a relevant framework for assessing the current administration's actions in the realm of human rights and proposing measures for the next four years.     While the letter we sent at the beginning of your first term focused on the substantive human rights problems facing Brazil, this correspondence evaluates the measures implemented during your tenure as president and those that still may be adopted. In large part, the change in focus is a result of your administration's welcome recognition of the existence of the problems noted above. Indeed, the historic drafting and release of the National Human Rights Program (Programa Nacional de Direitos Humanos, PNDH) on May 13, 1996, whose anniversary we celebrate today, represents the federal government's acknowledgment of the scope and gravity of human rights abuses facing Brazil. The broad participation of human rights organizations in the drafting of the PNDH demonstrated your administration's commitment to open, productive relations with domestic and international civil society.     As I explain below, we have been encouraged by several critical developments at the federal level in the past four years both to recognize and address the human rights problems cited above. For example, Human Rights Watch welcomed the process of consultation with domestic and international civil society that led to the National Human Rights Program, as well as the creation of the National Secretariat for Human Rights, in part, to assist in the implementation of the PNDH. While acknowledging the important measures undertaken by this past administration, we believe that in several areas, critical steps must be taken if Brazil is to meet its international human rights obligations.     The document that follows addresses our principal areas of concern, focusing on what we believe to be the most critically needed measures at the federal level. I hope that you will afford this correspondence your serious attention and that, in your second term, you will place compliance with Brazil's international human rights obligations among the very highest priorities of your administration.     Sincerely,     Dr. José Miguel Vivanco","Americas, Brazil",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/05/12/regional-grievances-and-indonesian-elections","Regional Grievances and the Indonesian Elections","Regional Grievances and the Indonesian Elections","Testimony before the House International Relations Committee Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee by Sidney Jones, Executive Director, Human Rights Watch, Asia Division","05/12/1999","The first free elections in Indonesia since 1955 are now less than a month away. I would like to focus my attention on areas where the forthcoming election has generated little excitement and where discontent with the government in Jakarta is so deep that any new government coming in will have to confront the fundamental question of the country's unity. Three provinces -- Aceh, Irian Jaya, and Maluku (the Moluccas) -- were seeing major problems with voter registration as of early May, and in East Timor, moves toward a referendum on independence scheduled for August were rendering the June 7 vote irrelevant. The violence and unresolved grievances in these areas, as well as in West Kalimantan, and to a lesser extent in Riau province on the eastern coast of Sumatra, are important, because they underscore how little the elections are going to solve, even if they are free and fair.   This is not to demean the importance of the elections themselves or to diminish the huge step toward democratization that they will represent. But it underscores the need to look beyond June 7 and beyond November, when a new president will be chosen, to some of the political shoals ahead.      I. East Timor   The more important vote for East Timor is not June 7 but August 8, when East Timorese will vote in a ballot organized and conducted by the United Nations on whether they accept or reject an autonomy package that would leave the territory under Indonesian sovereignty. East Timorese provincial government leaders seem determined to proceed with the June 7 elections, and pro-Indonesia militias may see it as a useful focus for mobilizing their forces. With election day falling in the midst of a major deployment of U.N. personnel, however, the attention of most East Timorese is likely to be elsewhere.   This hearing may not be the place to discuss the obstacles to a fair ballot on August 8, but they are enormous. And even if, by some miracle, that vote proceeds smoothly, the question is what happens after the votes are counted, since it is not at all clear that the losing side will accept the outcome. There are at least three possible scenarios:   1. The vote is 85 percent or more in favor of rejecting the autonomy package. In effect, it is an overwhelming vote in favor of independence. Indonesia's highest legislative body, the MPR, agrees to let East Timor go, East Timor reverts to its pre-1976 political status, and a U.N. transition authority is established that will lead to independence. At this stage, an overwhelming vote in favor of independence would probably carry the least threat of violence, but it might well lead to an exodus of pro-Indonesia advocates and their families, civil servants associated with the Indonesian administration, and non-Timorese. After the militia attacks of the last few months, however, I am not sure that an overwhelming vote for independence is the most likely scenario, especially if the U.N. and the international community cannot guarantee that pro-independence groups will be able to compete on the same footing as the military-backed militias.   2. The vote is closer to 70 percent in favor of rejecting autonomy, with an overwhelming majority favoring independence in eastern East Timor and a much more ambivalent vote in the western districts, including Liquica and Bobonaro. Maliana, the district capital of Bobonaro, is one of the militia strongholds. Under these circumstances, the MPR would still agree to let East Timor go, but such a split vote could be a recipe for major violence on the part of the militias in those districts, violence that could eventually envelop the territory.   3. The vote is 65 percent or lower in favor of rejecting autonomy. Then the MPR will be placed in a very difficult position and might not agree to East Timor's separation. If it does not, it will be the pro-independence groups that turn to violence. If the MPR does agree to separation, the pro-Indonesia militias would likely rebel.   In the meantime, both the autonomy package and the U.N. operation in East Timor are likely to be heavily scrutinized by Indonesian provinces desirous of more devolution of power from the center, since the autonomy package grants more power to something called the Special Administrative Region of East Timor than provinces currently have under new laws on revenue-sharing and government decentralization that were approved at the end of April. The package also includes more explicit protections for human rights than any Indonesian province currently enjoys. With movements for independence gathering strength in several different areas of Indonesia, developments in East Timor have major implications for Indonesia as a whole.      II. Aceh   The special region of Aceh had one of the lowest registration rates in the country as of about two weeks ago. It is now reported to be up to 50 percent province-wide, but with an election boycott campaign in full swing, there are still almost no voters registered in large areas of three of the region's most important districts, North Aceh, East Aceh, and Pidie.   North Aceh, where Mobil Oil has major investments, had a 20 percent registration rate as of May 8, and it is an area where pro-independence activity, both armed and unarmed, is highest.   Local people held deep grievances against the central government anyway, largely for failing to make any move toward prosecuting army officers for systematic human rights abuses that occurred there between 1990 and 1998, and a massacre by the army of at least forty civilians on May 4 is certain to heighten them.(1)   The demand in East Timor for a referendum on independence, widely publicized in Indonesia after Soeharto's resignation, directly influenced students in Aceh, who on January 28, 1999, at an all-Aceh student congress, started a movement to call for a similar referendum in Aceh. The movement grew with astonishing speed, moving far beyond student circles including into the current political campaign, and it is not likely to disappear any time soon. Serious prosecutions of past abuses may be the only way to halt the momentum, but chances of that appear slim.   In the meantime, there are allegations and counter-allegations about intimidation of would-be voters in Aceh, to the point that many Acehnese are afraid to register, let alone to join political parties or actively campaign. The army says that the rebel group, Aceh Merdeka (the Free Aceh Movement) is behind the intimidation, a charge Aceh Merdeka spokesmen have denied. Some Acehnese opposition politicians say that in fact, the ruling party Golkar and the army have the most to lose from a free election in Aceh and the most to gain by intimidation. But in the meantime, the level of fear is such that according to one account, 150 village heads in North Aceh resigned, rather than continue to be subjected to threats from unidentified sources.(2)   When I was in North Aceh last February, it was clear that Aceh Merdeka was very active and had almost certainly committed serious human rights violations, including executions of suspected collaborators with the Indonesian government. It was also clear, however, that the military response, involving widespread arbitrary detention, torture, and killings, was only serving to generate more resentment of Jakarta and more support for a referendum.   At least one of the political parties, Partai Amanat Nasional or PAN, has campaigned on a platform of federalism, an idea that seemed to have widespread support in Aceh. But the events of recent weeks, including the May 4 massacre, may further radicalize the Acehnese, with far-reaching consequences.   Aceh, unlike East Timor, is critical to Indonesia's concept of itself as a nation. East Timor was never part of the Indonesian nationalist struggle, and its departure from the Indonesian republic, to which it was illegally annexed in 1976, will not put the unity of the Indonesian republic in jeopardy. Aceh was not only at the forefront of the nationalist struggle against the Dutch colonial government, but it is vital to Indonesia, politically, strategically, and economically. The low registration rate in Aceh should thus be a wake-up call to Jakarta.      III. Irian Jaya   Irian Jaya is said to have a 70 percent registration rate as of last week. I'm not sure how the figures were calculated or how meaningful they are -- intimidation in Irian Jaya to vote for the ruling party has traditionally been overpowering, and it is too far away for most Jakarta election officials to take notice or care. Nevertheless, Irian Jaya is another area with a revitalized independence movement and one that is almost certain to grow unless it is handled with far more sensitivity than it has been thus far.   On February 26, 100 political, tribal, and community leaders from all over Irian Jaya presented a petition to President Habibie expressing a desire for independence of the country they call West Papua. This was supposed to be the first stage in a """"national dialogue"""" that was to be followed first by discussions of the meeting in local gatherings throughout Irian Jaya, then a workshop on March 31 to discuss options for change. Even before the meeting, the government had made it clear that of the three options -- """"O"""" for otonomi (autonomy), """"F"""" for federalism, and """"M"""" for merdeka or independence, the M option was off limits.   But after the statement was presented, the idea of a workshop seemed to evaporate, and the government made formal moves to shut off further debate. At the end of March, after a reception for one of the participants in the meeting, an NGO leader from Merauke named Max Mahuse, both Mahuse and the program organizer were summoned for interrogation by police. On April 17, an order went out from the provincial police command in Jayapura banning any attempts to set up local """"communication forums"""" to discuss the February 26 meeting. The police apparently feared that the forums would be little more than separatist fronts. On May 5, seventy-four people were arrested in the town of Fakfak, charged with planning to set up an independence taskforce.   In the middle of its efforts prevent debate on independence, the government announced that it was going to split Irian Jaya into three provinces. The timing of the announcement in April, just after a public expression in support of independence from leaders across the province and just before the national elections, was greeted with anger and suspicion from many within Irian. Irian Jaya is unquestionably a huge and difficult-to-manage province, but the division, which is likely to go forward immediately after the elections, seems more calculated as a security measure, to facilitate the breaking up of any Irian Jaya-wide political movement. Each new province would come with its own new complement of troops, unless the central government can be persuaded to treat Irian Jaya differently than it has other provinces.(3)      Other Problem Areas   East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya are not the only trouble spots. The oil-rich province of Riau on the east coast of Sumatra is threatening secession unless it gets a fair share of the income it produces. Violence in West Kalimantan between ethnic Dayaks and Malays on the one hand and Madurese on the other continues with no resolution in sight and with tens of thousands of displaced people causing a potential for further violence elsewhere. The communal violence in Ambon remains unresolved, and holding the elections in some districts there may well prove impossible. The army appears either incapable or unwilling of restraining some of the violence, and indeed, in some areas, is accused of provoking it. The police, marginally separated from the army as of April 1, are not yet under civilian control and in any case are too weak, too lacking in training, and in many places, too corrupt to rely on.      What can the U.S. do?   The U.S. has rightly accorded high priority to the elections and to voter education and training programs. It has also institututed a program to train the Jakarta police in crowd control, a program we very cautiously support, understanding the risks here are high. We support active and extensive U.S. participation in election-monitoring and urge in particular that some of these troublespots be given particular attention. But it is critical that the U.S. not lose sight of other pressing issues. In particular:   1. With respect to East Timor, we welcome indications of U.S. support for the U.N. Trust Fund and hope that the actual contributions of funds will take place expeditiously. We also hope that the U.S. will contribute its share to the U.N. civilian police force. But the U.S. must make it clear to the Habibie government that a vote on the autonomy package can only proceed if conditions for a reasonably fair ballot are in place. Those conditions will not be in place if the civilian militias, responsible for the deaths of scores of people in the last two months, are not disarmed. If the Indonesian government does not make progress in this disarming, the U.S. and other donors to Indonesia must increase the pressure to do so. One possible lever for doing so is a May 18 board meeting of the World Bank where two major loans are up for approval. The U.S. Executive Director could be urged to vote either against these loans or for postponing the date for meeting to approve them until the Indonesian government evidences clear determination to move forward with disarming, and the process has begun. Another lever would be for the U.S. to tell General Wiranto and the Indonesian army that it is dropping its support for the resumption of International Military and Education Training (IMET) until disarmament of the militias is underway.   2. The U.S. might be able to help cool the political temperature in Aceh by urging the Habibie government to make a far more serious effort to prosecute perpetrators of past abuses than it has thus far, but it must also press for a full investigation into the May 4 massacre in Lhokseumawe. It could offer forensic assistance for the investigation and exhumation of mass grave sites and fund legal assistance to Acehnese NGOs compiling evidence to use in eventual prosecutions. The planned reopening of a U.S. consular presence in Medan is a welcome development and will enable the U.S. to better monitor developments in Aceh, but unless there is serious, concerted, and multilateral pressure on the Habibie government and its successor for accountability of past abuses there, U.S. investments and U.S. interests could be in serious jeopardy.   3. The U.S. should discourage any steps that would serve to increase the size or role of the Indonesian army. It should actively discourage the establishment of new military commands. The Habibie government should be urged to reverse a decision to set up a new regional military command (KODAM) in Aceh. It should also be urged to consult extensively with the people of Irian Jaya, including religious and community leaders, before taking any decision to divide the province into three, especially given the military implications.   4. The US should continue to encourage Japan to constructively utilize its diplomatic and economic influence. As the lead aid donor, Japan's voice has been particularly helpful in recent weeks on East Timor. Just prior to the UN talks in New York last month, the Japanese foreign minister (Masahiko Komura) sent a letter to Ali Alatas, his Indonesian counterpart, and phoned Indonesian economic czar Ginandjar Kartasasmita to express concern about the escalating violence and attacks by the civilian militia. Japan is also providing funding and other support for the June elections.   Notes   1. The massacre occurred when soldiers opened fire on hundreds of people marching on an army base to protest military operations in the area. The operations began after a soldier disappeared during a pro-independence rally on April 30.   2. """"Menjegal Pemilu di Serambi Mekah,"""" Forum Keadilan, May 9, 1999.   3. The division of the province also has economic implications. Under the new Law on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations -- the revenue-sharing law -- provinces will be allowed to keep 80 percent of the revenue from mining, forestry and fishing, 30 percent of gas revenues, and 15 percent of oil revenues. Irian Jaya is rich in natural resources, and if the law is fully implemented, will receive far more than it does now of the income it produces.

Because of the submunitions' appearance—the CBU-87 and RBL755 bomblets are bright orange/yellow soda-can sized objects, while the ATACMS bomblets are bright baseball-sized spheres—children are particularly drawn to the volatile live remnants.

On April 24, five children playing with colorful unexploded submunitions were reported killed, and two injured, near Doganovic in southern Kosovo. In the short term, live submunitions pose a danger to civilians and refugees, and impede their movement. In the long term, they inhibit agriculture and economic recovery. The widespread use of cluster bombs can also pose a severe hazard to friendly ground force operations, including peacekeeping forces, as happened to international forces in the 1991 Gulf War. Cluster bombs have an estimated 5 percent mechanical and fuse failure rate. For Operation Allied Force in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the historical record and testing experience would tend to indicate that for every single CBU-87 used, there will be an average of some ten unexploded bomblets, and for every RBL755, there will be an average of five unexploded bomblets.  .It is possible that, if the bombing campaign continues, the U.S. Air Force may start using the CBU-89 Gator """"scatterable"""" mine system, which holds a mix of antitank and antipersonnel landmines.

As the parties prepare to enter peace negotiations to end the eight year-long civil war, the human rights organization urged special attention to the thousands of children who have been used as combatants in the conflict.   Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring agency, made the calls in letters to the leaders of the Sierra Leonean government and rebels. The Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah has made repeated international commitments to stop recruiting and to demobilize all children in pro-government armed forces, including the Kamajor civil defense forces. In preparation for the departure of ECOMOG peacekeeping forces, the Sierra Leone government is now recruiting and training its own national army. Human Rights Watch commended the government for restricting its recent mobilization of new recruits to individuals of age eighteen and above. """"We're pleased to see that the government is keeping its promise by refraining from enlisting children into its new army,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We urge the government to ensure that this policy is respected at all levels.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed deep concern, however, that large numbers of children in Bo and Kenema have reportedly been recruited by the Kamajor civil defense force. """"These children are being used as combatants, in direct violation of international law,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"The government has a responsibility to ensure that the Kamajors do not recruit children for military service.""""  The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has recruited thousands of child soldiers into its ranks during its campaign to topple the government. UNICEF reports that almost 3000 children have been reported missing or abducted since the rebels' January offensive and are presumed to have been abducted by the rebels. Recent testimonies collected by Human Rights Watch indicate that some of these children are currently undergoing military training. """"We urge the RUF to immediately end its recruitment of children, and to release all children currently in its ranks,"""" said Becker. She noted that 51 children abductees were freed by the RUF during the month of March, but said that """"releasing such small numbers of children is simply not adequate. All of the children in RUF forces must be demobilized immediately.""""  Last week, more than 250 representatives of Governments and civil society from fifty countries participated in the African conference on the use of child soldiers, held in Maputo, Mozambique. On April 22, participants adopted a declaration condemning the use of any child under the age of eighteen by any armed force or armed group, and calling upon all African states to ensure that children are not recruited into armed forces or militia forces under their jurisdiction, and that all child combatants are demobilized, rehabilitated, and reintegrated into society. Human Rights Watch, together with other leading international nongovernmental organizations, is part of the International Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers. The coalition seeks to strengthen international standards to protect children from military recruitment and use in armed conflict and to raise the minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict from 15, set by existing international law, to 18.","Africa, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

As the RUF prepares for upcoming peace negotiations with the Government of Sierra Leone, Human Rights Watch calls on the RUF to take human rights concerns into consideration, to continue to release abducted children, to demobilize all children within its ranks, and to stop recruiting children.   Although international law (as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 1949, their Additional Protocols of 1977 and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child) clearly prohibits the recruitment of any child under the age of 15, an international consensus is building in favor of the prohibitions on any military recruitment below the age of 18. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols bind all parties to the conflict, including the RUF.   Emotionally and physically immature, children are ill-equipped to deal with the harsh realities of armed conflict. Because of their inexperience and lack of training, child soldiers suffer far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts. Those who survive may be permanently disabled, or bear psychological scars from being forced to both commit and witness horrific atrocities. Former child combatants often require much more intensive rehabilitation and reintegration services than adult soldiers following a conflict. Often denied an education and the opportunity to learn skills that are beneficial to civilian society, former child combatants are often drawn back into conflicts, and are easy prey for armed groups and criminal gangs.   Last month, more than 250 representatives of Governments and civil society from fifty countries participated in the African conference on the use of child soldiers, held in Maputo, Mozambique.

The growing condemnation of the use of child soldiers by the international community is also reflected in Graca Machel's 1996 report to the United Nations on the impact of armed conflict on children, the United Nations Security Council statements of June 1998 and February 1999, the UN Secretary General's announcement in October 1998 of a new policy establishing 18 as the minimum age for all UN peacekeepers, and the formation last year of the international Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which is actively campaigning for the adoption and implementation of international standards prohibiting the recruitment or participation of children under the age of eighteen in armed conflict.   We have also sent a letter to the Government of Sierra Leone, urging them to respect international standards and refrain from using child soldiers.   The use of children as combatants contravenes common standards of decency.

Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah President of the Republic of Sierra Leone Minister of Defence and Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces Freetown, Sierra Leone   Dear President Kabbah:   Human Rights Watch would like to commend the government of Sierra Leone on its pledge to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, not to recruit children under the age of 18 for its armed forces and to facilitate the demobilization and reintegration of child combatants.   Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about recent reports from journalists and children's rights advocates that the Kamajor civil defense force has recently recruited large numbers of children in Bo and Kenema. After initiation into the Kamajor society, many children and adolescents are called upon to perform more dangerous functions than have traditionally been the province of Kamajor local defense forces. They are often placed into combatant roles in the national conflict and are involved in significant military operations. In accordance with its international commitments, the Government of Sierra Leone should instruct commanders, recruiters, and initiators of the Kamajors and other Civil Defense Forces (CDFs) not to recruit or initiate children under 18, or to deploy children in combat activities. In addition, the government should monitor the Kamajors and other CDFs to ensure that minors do not participate in armed forces.   Human Rights Watch commends the Government of Sierra Leone on its efforts, together with UNICEF and the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), to demobilize former child soldiers who have been released by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and Revolutionary United Front. We urge the government to follow through on its international commitments to effectively oversee the demobilization and reintegration of child combatants from all sides, and to take measures to ensure that these children are not re-recruited.   Finally, as the Government of Sierra Leone prepares for the eventual departure of ECOMOG and begins recruiting and training its own national army, we are pleased to note that steps are being taken to ensure that new recruits are age 18 or older. To aid this goal, Human Rights Watch recommends the following steps if not already implemented:  make the 18-year minimum explicit in all recruitment materials and announcements; require new recruits to provide proof that they are at least 18 years of age;  ensure that the policy is communicated to all commanders, and particularly those overseeing the recruitment and enlistment process; and  monitor the recruitment and training process to verify that no children under the age of 18 have been recruited.   Although international law (as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 1949, their Additional Protocols of 1977 and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child) clearly prohibits the recruitment of any child under the age of 15, an international consensus is building in favor of the prohibitions on any military recruitment below the age of 18. The decision by the government of Sierra Leone to establish 18 as the minimum age is consistent with this emerging consensus, and sets an important example for other military forces.   Emotionally and physically immature, children are ill-equipped to deal with the harsh realities of armed conflict. Because of their inexperience and lack of training, child soldiers suffer far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts. Those who survive may be permanently disabled, or bear psychological scars from being forced to both commit and witness horrific atrocities.

However, the 1,100-page study also said that at least three governments have used landmines even after signing the global treaty to ban their use. The three are Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. The study also charged that antipersonnel mines are being used for the first time in thirteen conflicts around the world, including in Yugoslavia, Turkey, Burma, Israel, and Sri Lanka.  The study, """"Landmine Monitor Report 1999,"""" was edited and produced by Human Rights Watch, a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. The release of the report coincides with the first meeting of the states that have signed the treaty so far, opening today in Maputo, Mozambique. """"Landmine Monitor 1999"""" contains country-by-country information about mine use, production, trade, stockpiling, humanitarian demining and mine survivor assistance. A 49-page Executive Summary is also available. More than eighty researchers gathered information for the Landmine Monitor, in more than 100 countries. In addition to country reports, the book also includes updates from major actors in the mine ban movement, such as key governments, United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Although the latest fighting in Yugoslavia and Kosovo began after the Landmine Monitor went to print, there have been numerous credible reports of extensive mine laying by Yugoslav forces in the past month. Yugoslav forces used millions of mines during conflict with Bosnia and Croatia. Yugoslavia has been one of the world's biggest producers and exporters of antipersonnel mines.  Human Rights Watch is a privately-funded international monitoring group based in New York. It is the lead agency in a core group of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The others are Handicap International, Kenya Coalition Against Landmines, Mines Action Canada, and Norwegian People's Aid.  Other findings of the report include:  The number of countries producing such mines has dropped from fifty-four to sixteen. Eight of the twelve biggest producers and exporters of mines over the past thirty years have signed the treaty and stopped production. Of the sixteen remaining producers, China is likely the biggest manufacturer today. Several have not made AP mines in recent years, including the United States and Singapore, but they reserve the right to resume production at any time. Russia in 1998 banned the production of """"blast"""" mines, the most common type of mine. Landmine Monitor research did not uncover any evidence of new production by treaty signatories.  There is no evidence of significant export of antipersonnel mines by any country, signatory or non-signatory. Landmine Monitor identified thirty-four past exporters, but all, with the exception of Iraq, have at least made a formal statement that they are no longer exporting. Although the Mine Ban Treaty has been criticized for not including any major mine exporters, the fact is that there are no major mine exporters today, and most of the major exporters of the past have signed the treaty. More than 250 million antipersonnel mines are stockpiled in at least 108 countries. The most common previous estimate was 100 million, but Landmine Monitor contains the most accurate and comprehensive information to date. China is estimated to have 110 million antipersonnel mines, Russia some 60-70 million, and Belarus possibly tens of millions. However, stockpiled mines are also being destroyed in significant numbers. More than thirty countries have destroyed more than 12 million antipersonnel mines. Twelve countries have completely destroyed their mine arsenals thus far. Seventeen major donors spent approximately $640 million from 1993-1998 to help rid the world of landmines. While not a complete total, this figure comes closer than expected to the U.S. government's """"2010 initiative,"""" which calls for $1 billion per year in global mine funding. The vast majority of these funds have gone to Afghanistan (more than $113 million), Mozambique (more than $90 million), and Cambodia (about $83 million), as well as Bosnia and Angola.","Global","Arms, Landmines"

On April 27, the governor of North Kivu reportedly ordered the estimated 100,000 Rwandan refugees living in that province to go home within fifteen days. The governor also threatened that Congolese nationals who continue to harbor refugees after two weeks will be considered criminals.  """"These are serious violations of international refugee law,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the executive director of the Africa Division. """"These refugees may face persecution if they are forced to return to Rwanda.""""  Governor Kanyamuhanga Gafunzi accused the Hutu refugees of assisting Interahamwe Hutu militias in destabilizing peace and security in both the rebel-held eastern Congo and neighboring Rwanda and of fostering ethnic divisions in Congo. The refugees initially fled to eastern Congo in 1994, fearing retribution for the Rwandan genocide in which Hutu extremists massacred more than half a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in that country. Despite increasing insecurity in eastern Congo, many refugees remain in hiding or are settled with the local population in that region, fearing reprisals if they return home. The governor appears to have decided to force them back to Rwanda. The refugees have credible fears of attacks by the Rwandan military once they return to their homes. Human Rights Watch urged the Rwandan government to acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and prosecute those responsible for abuses. Some 125,000 people continue to languish in Rwandan prisons, suspected of active participation in the 1994 genocide. While the Rwandan government must pursue justice for the victims of genocide, it should also improve respect for human rights in the country and convene fair and speedy trials for all suspects.  Human Rights Watch also called on the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) and the international community to vigorously press the Congolese Rally for Democracy not to forcibly repatriate Rwandan refugees from areas it controls. It urged the international community to ensure that genuine refugees who opt to remain in eastern Congo are accorded the protection to which they are entitled under international law.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Migrants"

Commission on Human Rights """"deeply disappointing"""" and said it reflected badly on the Commission's own commitment to freedom of expression. By a vote of 22 to 17 with 14 abstentions, the Commission supported a motion, introduced by the Chinese delegation, to shelve a resolution critical of China's human rights record without formal debate. The resolution had been sponsored by the U.S. and Poland. Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch, said the vote was particularly unfortunate because the human rights situation in China had noticeably worsened this past year, with a major crackdown on political dissent, tightened control over the media, stepped-up """"patriotic reeducation"""" campaigns in Tibet, and the systematic violation of worker rights.  """"This vote undermines the Commission,"""" said Weschler. """"It suggests that large and powerful countries like China can intimidate members of the commission into ignoring serious abuse."""" She faulted the E.U. and China's other major trading partners for refusing to co-sponsor the resolution, leaving the impression that human rights in China was no longer an international concern. She also noted that had the U.S. committed itself to a resolution in late 1998 rather than only five weeks ago, it might have been able to overcome the reluctance of other countries to join forces. """"No one comes out of this process looking good,"""" Weschler said.  Countries offered various excuses for not backing the resolution. The European Union, Australia, and Canada all said that their ongoing human rights dialogues with China were more productive than public criticism. Some Asian countries quietly said that they could not take on China politically. The Japanese press suggested the U.S. only introduced the resolution to appease a domestic constituency. Some countries remembered the treatment Denmark received when it co-sponsored a China resolution in 1997 — China threatened to cancel all business deals with Danish companies, a threat that was never carried out.  """"In fact, only sustained public pressure has led Chinese officials to make significant moves on human rights—that's how they agreed to these bilateral dialogues in the first place,"""" said Weschler. As for the threat of retaliation by China against individual members, Weschler said there was a simple solution.

Yesterday, gunmen belonging to the uppercaste Hindu militia killed twelve people in an attack on two neighboring villages in the Gaya district, south of the state capital, Patna. According to press reports, the victims included four women and a baby. The hands of some victims were reportedly bound together before they were shot. The killings were in apparent retaliation for the killing of thirtyfive upper caste villagers by Maoist guerrillas last month. As rival political parties in New Delhi struggle to form a new government, violence against the country's most marginalized groups continues. In a 291-page report released on April 14, “Broken People: Caste Violence Against India's ‘Untouchables,’” Human Rights Watch documented other recent incidents of violence in Bihar in which private militias like the Ranvir Sena have killed Dalit villagers with impunity. Extremist guerrilla groups have retaliated by killing highcaste villagers, leading to an escalating cycle of violence. Such attacks on civilians constitute violations of international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch has called for independent investigations into the killings and for the disarming of the militias. The group has also urged that authorities provide full security to villagers against further Ranvir Sena attacks.  """"The government's failure to stop the Ranvir Sena this time and protect these Dalit villages amounts to criminal negligence,"""" said Patti Gossman, senior researcher for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch.  The Ranvir Sena, which is one of the most prominent militias, has been responsible for the massacre of more than 400 Dalit villagers in Bihar between 1995 and 1999. Within a span of three weeks in January and February 1999, sena members killed 34 Dalit villagers in two separate attacks. On March 19, 1999, members of the Maoist Communist Centre, a guerrilla organization with lowcaste supporters, beheaded 33 uppercaste villagers in retaliation for the sena killings.  Despite the fact that the senas frequently give warnings before they attack, little has been done to protect vulnerable villages and prevent attacks. The senas, which claim many politicians as members, operate with impunity. In some cases, police have accompanied them during their attacks and have stood by as they killed villagers in their homes. In other cases, police raids have followed attacks by the senas. The purpose of the raids is often to terrorize Dalits as a group, whether or not they are members of guerilla organizations. During the raids, the police have routinely beaten villagers, sexually assaulted women, and destroyed property. Sena leaders and police officials have never been prosecuted for such killings and abuses.  Human Rights Watch reiterates its call on the Indian government at the central and state level to implement a 1989 law banning atrocities against Dalits.","Asia, India",""

With new countries joining NATO, the alliance has a unique opportunity to set some basic ground rules for its members,"""" said Loretta Bondì,advocacy coordinator of the Arms Division, an international monitoring group based in New York. """"One of the new groundrules of NATO has got to be that all members should use maximum restraint in selling off arms stockpiles."""" Bondì noted that unfortunately, the lethal trade is likely to increase as former Warsaw Pact countries continue upgrading their arsenals to meet NATO standards.  The briefing paper, """"Arsenals on the Cheap: NATO expansion and the Arms Cascade"""" says that since the early 1990s, Warsaw Pact standard weapons, particularly small arms, were acquired by combatants in Africa and elsewhere sometimes in violation of international or regional arms embargoes. Some examples: Between 1992 and 1995, Germany disposed of 500 tanks, 1,400 armored combat vehicles, and 400 artillery pieces inherited from the former East Germany. One of the buyers was Turkey, which has been responsible for persistent patterns of gross abuses, including forced displacement and the destruction of villages in the Kurdish region. In July 1995, Ukrainian arms were supplied to the Rwandan exile forces based in eastern Zaire. This shipment violated the May 1994 United Nations arms embargo.  Russia has been a reliable arms supplier to Burundian forces, which have been under a regional arms embargo since August 1996. Poland reportedly blocked a shipment of fifty T-55 tanks to Sudan only after U.S. protests. Sudan is targeted by a European Union arms embargo. Bulgaria calculated that destroying its excess tanks and selling them for scrap could fetch a meager profit of just U.S.$2,000 for each. Selling them, however, would bring U.S.$30,000 per tank. In December 1998, Bulgaria sold 140 surplus tanks to Ethiopia and Uganda, which are both involved in conflicts with their neighbors.  Human Rights Watch wrote NATO Secretary General Javier Solana on April 27, 1998 to ask whether NATO had compiled a full inventory of allies' and perspective members' surplus weapons stocks. The letter also asked about safekeeping, accounting, and control procedures for current and projected weapons stockpiles; steps to encourage harmonization of export controls; and programs to control illicit transfers of light weapons in the context of NATO peacekeeping operations.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia","Arms"

The two unrelated incidents highlight the continuing disregard for human rights by both parties to the sixteen-year civil war in Sudan.   The rebels, the southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, took the four men into custody on February 18, 1999, when they strayed into SPLA territory not far from southern oil fields being exploited by the government and Chinese, Malaysian, and Canadian companies. Three were government employees; the fourth was a Red Crescent officer. An SPLA investigation concluded that the government employees, Ismail Edaam Ibrahim, Abdu Ahmed Tia, and Chief Maylik Chol Bilkuei, were """"spies"""" and that the Red Crescent staff member, John Gatkoy, was not. The SPLA next announced that on March 31 all four died in cross-fire as a result of a failed government """"rescue attempt."""" The SPLA has refused to release the bodies.   Human Rights Watch fears that the four men were summarily executed by the SPLA, a clear violation of international and domestic law. Meanwhile, the government of Sudan has used the SPLA's refusal to turn over the bodies as an excuse to delay the start of peace negotiations scheduled for mid-April and to block a United Nations relief assessment in the rebel-held area of the Nuba mountains.   """"The refusal to release the bodies strongly suggests that the four men were executed by the SPLA,"""" said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"At the same time, the Sudan government should not be using it cynically to block much-needed relief to Nuba civilians, or to derail peace efforts.""""   The government has also covered up the deaths of three men whom Sudan Security reportedly tortured to death in late 1998. The three, Abdallah Chol, Hassan Abu Adhan, and Gladino (Sam) Okieny, were among more than twenty-six persons, including two Roman Catholic priests, detained in connection with an alleged conspiracy to bomb public buildings in Khartoum on June 30.   The trial of defendants, who are mostly southerners, has not conformed to the standards of international law. Six defendants are being tried in absentia. The court rejected several defense attorneys chosen by the defendants, whose access to counsel has been extremely limited. The trial is before a specially constituted military court (two of whose judges have no legal qualifications). There is no right of appeal. The court refused to investigate the sworn statements of nineteen defendants that they were tortured or otherwise coerced into signing false confessions.   The """"ringleader"""" of the bombing conspiracy is alleged to be Father Hillary Boma, the Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Khartoum. He has been an outspoken critic of the government. His """"confession"""" was coerced by the threat of further mistreatment of his colleague, Father Lino Sebit. Proceedings in the case have been suspended for five months, while the defendants remain in jail.   """"This is not a trial, it's a disgrace and a mockery of justice,"""" said Rone.   Human Rights Watch called on both the Sudan government and the SPLM/A to release the bodies for forensic examination by independent experts and to conduct and permit others to conduct full investigations into these deaths in custody. It also urged the Sudan government to bring the trial of the two priests and the other defendants into conformity with international law, or dismiss the case.","Africa, Sudan",""

In a statement delivered today at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights meeting in Geneva, Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch, urged the Commission to act to prevent governments from abusing its procedures.  Weschler noted that in the past, members have used a technical procedure known as a """"no-action motion"""" to prevent the Commission from voting on resolutions examining the human rights situation in particular countries. China will introduce such a motion on Friday to preempt discussion of a U.S.-sponsored resolution critical of its human rights practices. Weschler called this use of the no-action motion a violation of Commission principles, including freedom of expression, and said it dilutes the Commission's integrity and effectiveness.  The resolution that China will try and kill on Friday recognizes """"the significant transformation Chinese society has undergone"""" and the progress it has made in bringing its legal system in line with prevailing standards, but it expresses concern over continuing violations. It also cites restrictions on free expression, assembly, association and religion and fair trials.  Human Rights Watch says that China has arbitrarily detained citizens peacefully opposing government policies, given long prison sentences to political activists trying to form an opposition political party, tortured and imprisoned Tibetans agitating for autonomy or independence, fined Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists who refuse to accept state control of religious activities, and attempted to close down Internet sites and muzzle newspapers permitting relatively free political discussion.  The full text of Ms. Weschler's remarks follows.  Madam Chair,  Human Rights Watch considers the effective functioning of United Nations human rights mechanisms to be essential to the advancement of human rights. The most important of these mechanisms, obviously, is the Commission on Human Rights itself. Therefore, Madam Chair, allow me to share with you a serious concern and let me call on member states to address this situation.  The Rules of Procedure of the Functional Commissions of the Economic and Social Council foresee a possibility of taking a vote on a motion to take no decision on a proposal submitted to the commission. Such a vote is typically appropriate when more than one proposal is submitted on the same issue or when amendments are added to an existing text.  In the last several years, however, this procedure, commonly known as a """"no action motion,"""" has been repeatedly used to prevent the Commission from voting on resolutions examining the human rights situation in particular countries. The decision not to hold a vote on a country resolution (or any other resolution, for that matter) has the effect of preventing the Commission from debating the resolution's subject matter. As such, it stands in violation of several important principles the Commission has repeatedly stood by and defended so far, such as non-selectivity, impartiality and freedom of expression.  Madam Chair, this use of the no action motions promotes selectivity. It is simply wrong for the Commission to tolerate a situation in which a country that is powerful enough to generate sufficient number of votes or abstentions can block the Commission from holding a debate on an important issue or situation. This practice has serious consequences for the Commission and erodes its integrity and effectiveness.  Madam Chair, Human Rights Watch urges members of the Commission to reject any no action motions regarding a whole issue (as opposed to an amendment or alterative proposals) that might be presented during the current session and, by doing so, to reaffirm the important principle of non-selectivity.  We further suggest that the Commission seek reinterpretation or modification of its rules of procedure in order to prevent similar misuse of this rule in the years to come.  Thank you, Madam Chair.","Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"

The organization called on Indonesia's major donors to make further disbursements of World Bank adjustment loans conditional on verifiable progress by the Indonesian government in disarming the militias and prosecuting those responsible for the violence.  Militia violence has escalated steadily since January 1999, causing thousands of villagers to be displaced and several dozen people to be killed. In the most recent incident, at least twelve and as many as eighteen people were killed in Dili on April 17 when militias attacked the home of independence activist Manuel Carrascalao, killing his son and many others who had sought refuge in the house.  """"There was ample warning that these militias, backed by local civilian and military authorities, would attack pro-independence targets, but the government in Jakarta did nothing,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Now it's a question of whether Indonesia's major donors will put the necessary pressure on Jakarta to disarm the militias and get an international presence in East Timor as quickly as possible.""""  Jones noted that there was also a medical crisis, with the Indonesian government holding up assistance by international humanitarian agencies, both in the form of additional doctors as well as badly needed medical supplies. The crisis has been caused not only by the exodus of non-Timorese healthcare professionals, following some well-publicized attacks on non-Timorese doctors, apparently by independence supporters, in February 1999, but also by the sharp increase in violence, with more victims than most local clinics can accommodate. """"Since appeals have not worked, it is time to exert some economic pressure, and adjustment loans are a useful tool,"""" said Jones. At the July 1998 meeting of donors collectively known as the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), the World Bank agreed to make several major loans to Indonesia, totalling more than US$3 billion, only $1 billion of which has been disbursed. In an upcoming meeting in May, the Bank board will have to approve two loans, the social safety net adjustment loan (SSNAL) and the public reform structural adjustment loan (PRSAL). Human Rights Watch urges executive directors of the Bank from CGI countries to vote to delay approval of these loans until the government has taken concrete steps to disarm the militias in East Timor.  """"Both of these loans have laudable goals, but the Indonesian government's unwillingness to control these militias raises doubts about its willingness to undertake other difficult policy steps,"""" said Jones. She said a delay in the loans might give the Habibie government an incentive to take action. Human Rights Watch cited the following evidence of the lack of political will of the Habibie government to curb the violence in East Timor: Civilian militias have been operating with the formal and visible support of local authorities and in some case are led by civilian or military officials.  The individuals who instigated the violence on April 17 have a long history of involvement with the military and have been allowed to engage in threats and violence with impunity.  The attack on April 17 was widely rumored, but the government took no steps to avert the violence.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice, Free Speech, World Bank, IMF"

The document in question was a list of Chinese citizens with valid passports who were barred from leaving or returning to China because of their political activities. After serving four years of a twelve-year prison term, Chen is reported to be seriously ill with a liver disease. He is currently detained in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, and Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China want him freed. Chen should never have been arrested in the first place,"""" Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"He risked his freedom to expose the Chinese government's practice of closing its borders to outspoken citizens.""""  Jones noted that China signed a treaty last October, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees the right of all citizens to enter and leave their own country and the right to impart information """"regardless of frontiers."""" """"It is outrageous that Chen should be suffering in prison for damaging China's `reputation,'"""" said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China. """"What really damages China is barring peaceful advocates of human rights and democracy from returning to their home country.""""  """"The Chinese government continues to push for `dialogue' with other countries,"""" said Xiao. """"But such `dialogue' is meaningless if there is no true dialogue between Beijing and its own citizens.""""  The two human rights organizations said they had no way of assessing the gravity of Chen's illness, but that reports coming out were serious enough to warrant a thorough medical examination by doctors not linked to the prison system. Chen is said by some sources to be suffering from hepatitis B and C. In addition, he is thought to have been held in solitary confinement since he was detained on March 14, 1995, a situation which may have aggravated his condition. Prolonged use of solitary confinement violates both Chinese law and international human rights standards.  Chen was tried by the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court in a closed proceeding on an unknown date in 1996 and convicted of illegally providing state secrets to organizations outside China's borders. The verdict sentencing him to prison was delivered on April 15, 1997, and some months later, his appeal against his conviction was rejected. He was accused of faxing a top-secret document to """"organizations outside China's borders."""" Translations of the verdict and appeal are appended below.  The document in question was the notorious """"blacklist"""" of Chinese nationals or former nationals either barred from entering China or otherwise to be subjected to arrest or other measures on their arrival at the border. Although the existence of such a list had long been suspected, there was no evidence to show that one did in fact exist until Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China published a report containing the information from the document Chen Meng had sent to Hong Kong. This report, entitled """"China: Enforced Exile of Dissidents: Government `Re-entry Blacklist' Revealed,"""" was published in January 1995.  The impact of the document, entitled """"A List of 49 Overseas Members of Reactionary Organizations Currently Subject to Major Control,"""" was to strand dissident citizens abroad without legal protections of any kind, in clear violation of international law. The vast majority of the people on the list in question have done nothing more than engage in peaceful advocacy for the democratization of China and for greater respect for human rights. Fifty percent of those on the list were put on police """"most wanted"""" notices following the June 4, 1989, crackdown. Others include former political prisoners and people who have had their Chinese passports confiscated or canceled while living overseas. Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China do not believe the document to be an exhaustive list.  As the rejection of Chen's appeal indicates, the authorities considered that the release of this document was damaging to the """"reputation"""" of the government, and this is why it was classified. Most legal scholars reject such an application of the concept of """"state secrets."""" According to the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, drafted in 1995 by an international team of human rights experts, including legal scholars, U.N. rights specialists and diplomats, restrictions on freedom of expression on national security grounds are illegitimate when their purpose is """"protecting the government from embarrassment, or exposure of wrongdoing, or to entrench a particular ideology, or to conceal information about the functioning of its public institutions, or to suppress industrial action"""" (emphasis added).  Chen was an unemployed musician at the time of his arrest. He had obtained a copy of the document from his brother-in-law, Tang Tao, who was then a border guard and is now serving a six-year sentence for leaking state secrets. For her role in helping her brother to fax the document to Hong Kong, Chen's sister, Bai Suping, was sentenced to a two-and-a-half-year term in reeducation through labor, an administrative punishment imposed without a trial. Bai Suping completed the term in 1997.  A document recently adopted by the United Nations further demonstrates that according to international law, those who expose human rights abuses should not be subject to prosecution. Chen faxed the """"blacklist"""" document to Hong Kong in November 1994 because he thought that the information it contained should be made public; he was clearly motivated by the desire to expose the abuse of human rights which the blacklist represented, and thus his action should be considered as protected under the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in December 1998. The Declaration's Article 8 reads:  1. Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to have effective access, on a non-discriminatory basis, to participation in the government of one's country and in the conduct of public affairs.  2. This includes, inter alia, the right, individually and in association with others, to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs, criticism and proposals for their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms (emphasis added).  Human Rights in China and Human Rights Watch therefore believe that Chen and Tang Tao should be promptly released and cleared of all charges. The reports of Chen's ill-health suggest that he should be released on medical parole immediately.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Some of these children are no more than 7 years of age.  The report, released by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, said the countries most affected were Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda. """"African children are being targeted across the continent as tools of war,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, which chairs the international coalition. He called upon governments to stop recruiting children into their own armed forces and to end all support to rebel groups that used children as soldiers. """"This research should provoke outrage from civil society and governments like,"""" said Iain Levine, UN representative for Amnesty International at a press conference today at the United Nations. """"We hope it will compel action to end this horrific problem.""""  Children are often recruited by government armed forces as a matter of course. Some children do volunteer to join the armed forces, but tens of thousands of children are forced to join up, sometimes at gunpoint. In Angola, forced recruitment of youth (""""Rusgas"""") continues in some of the suburbs around the capital and throughout the country, especially in rural areas. Some reports suggest that military commanders have paid police officers to find new recruits. In Uganda, street children have been forced to join the army in order to be sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Girls too are used as soldiers, though generally in much smaller numbers. Concy A., a 14-year old girl, was abducted from Kitgum in Uganda and taken to Sudan by the armed opposition group, the Lord's Resistance Army. """"In Sudan we were distributed to men and I was given to a man who had just killed his woman,"""" Concy recounted to one interviewer. """"I was not given a gun, but I helped in the abductions and grabbing of food from villagers. Girls who refused to become LRA wives were killed in front of us to serve as a warning to the rest of us."""" Child soldiers have all too frequently committed atrocities. In Algeria, a young woman from one of the villages where massacres had taken place said that all of the killers were boys under 17. She said some boys who looked to be around 12 decapitated a 15-year-old girl and played 'catch' with the head.  Government-sponsored militia forces pose particular problems. In Burundi, in addition to widespread recruitment into regular armed forces, Tutsi armed groups, made up of youth aged from 12 to 25, have been formed with the encouragement of government authorities. Government militias in Congo-Brazzaville, which have been widely credited with widespread human rights abuses, include many teenage children among their ranks.  Many of the worst abuses have been committed by armed opposition groups. The Hutu opposition in Burundi has systematically recruited boys and girls under 15 years of age into its armed groups. In Sierra Leone, rebel forces have systematically recruited children, some as young as 7 years of age. In Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) abducts children from their schools, communities and homes. Children are killed if they attempt to escape or resist, or if they cannot keep up, or become ill. If they do manage to escape, they must then face the wrath of the government. In January 1999, the Ugandan army executed, in circumstances still to be clarified, five teenage boys between the ages of 14 and 17 suspected of being rebel soldiers.  When not actively engaged in combat, children are often used to man checkpoints. Adult soldiers tend to stand several metres further back so that if bullets start flying, the children will be the first victims. And in any conflict where even a few children are involved as soldiers, all children, civilian or combatant, come under suspicion. A recent military sweep in Congo-Brazzaville, for instance, killed all rebels who had attained the 'age of bearing arms'. The report, which is being published to coincide with the opening in Maputo, Mozambique of a Regional Conference on the Use of Children as Soldiers, includes the best information to date on national recruitment legislation and practice and, in situations of armed conflict, child participation in armed conflict. The overwhelming majority of African countries have set 18 years as the minimum age for recruitment, whether voluntary or through conscription. Notable exceptions are Angola, which recently reduced its conscription age to 17, and Uganda, which appears to allow children over 13 years of age to enlist in certain circumstances. South Africa, which currently accepts volunteers at 17 years, plans to raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years in the coming months. The Conference, which is being organized jointly by the Coalition and Save the Children, a non-governmental organization, is the first of four regional conferences to be held this year. The others will be held in Latin America, Asia and Europe. The Maputo Conference will bring together the largest-ever gathering of African governments, non-governmental organizations, and representatives of the United Nations and the Red Cross to seek to end the use of children as soldiers. The Coalition, which is headed by seven international non-governmental organizations, was formed in May 1998. It is spearheading campaigns against the use of child soldiers in more than twenty countries around the world.","Africa","Children's Rights"

Commission On Human Rights (55th Session) By Human Rights Watch","Under Agenda Item 14 On The Kosovo Refugee Crisis","04/15/1999","In a statement delivered today at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch called for immediate action to assist Kosovar refugees and establish conditions suitable for their peaceful return home. Access to refugee protection: Fifty years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its promise of the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution rings hollow for the Kosovo Albanians. Testimony of hundreds of refugees at the border establishes a clear Serb policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing. Kosovo Albanians are facing mass expulsion from their homes and villages, systematic destruction of their property, and even execution by Serb military and paramilitary units. We believe that all those fleeing Kosovo have a valid fear of persecution and should be considered as bona fide refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention. Yet the Serb authorities have intermittently closed the borders with Macedonia and Albania and forced the fleeing refugees back to uncertain fate in Kosovo. And Macedonia has played the reluctant host, repeatedly closing its border to refugees and stalling on their admission to its territory. Finally, countries offering protection outside of the region promise only temporary protection, which we know from Bosnia can mean long-term legal limbo.  Human Rights Watch urges the Commission to resolve that the fleeing Kosovar refugees shall enjoy unhindered access to countries of asylum and full recognition of their Convention refugee status. In the event that a mass influx of asylum seekers makes immediate individual status determination impracticable and states extend some form of temporary protection, the full rights of the refugees must still be protected, particularly against refoulement. Temporary protection should not be used as a lesser status, or as a substitute for full refugee protection. No one should be returned to their country without an individual examination of their asylum claim.  Treatment of refugees: Human Rights Watch monitors working on Kosovo's borders have for the past three weeks reported appalling conditions for the half million people fleeing Serb atrocities. First, in the early days of the refugee crisis inadequate preparation by the international community left thousands with almost no food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and other humanitarian assistance. While these resource problems have now substantially abated, thousands have been involuntarily deported from Macedonia to third countries, in many cases separated from their families and communities, deprived of information about their destination or rights, and denied the benefit of registration or monitoring by UNHCR and other refugee assistance organizations. To address these concerns, the Commission should call for the continued international commitment of resources to deal adequately with the influx into neighboring countries. In particular, the Commission should urge the UNHCR and receiving states take immediate steps to implement the UNHCR's guidelines on the protection of refugee women and children. The Commission should also emphasize the importance of providing refugees with some form of identification that can eventually facilitate their voluntary return to Kosovo when it becomes safe. The Finally, the Commission should resolve that no refugees shall be transferred to third countries involuntarily or in violation of the principle of family unity. Root causes for the Kosovo Albanians' flight: It is impossible to discuss the plight of Kosovar refugees and displaced persons without reference to the gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law compelling their flight. It is the international community's repeated failures—to condemn and sanction the persistent violations of human rights in Kosovo over the past decade, to signal an end to impunity by arresting the architects of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and to act decisively when the atrocities began in Kosovo over a year ago—that has brought us this current crisis. As the Commission recognized in its resolution on Kosovo adopted earlier this week, the international community must hold those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo accountable and insist on a resolution to the conflict in Kosovo that will ensure all refugees the right to return under conditions ensuring their safety and full enjoyment of fundamental human rights.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

""""This was not a fair trial, not a fair sentence, and the process raises profound questions about the independence of the Malaysian judiciary."""" Human Rights Watch, which sent several observers to Anwar's trial, said the trial had been marred from the outset by the lack of presumption of innocence, an essential judicial principle. Prime Minister Mahathir himself frequently expressed his belief in Anwar's guilt before the trial began. The use of the Internal Security Act to arrest Anwar and some of the witnesses; the beating of Anwar in custody, apparently by the chief of police himself, who later resigned; and the repeated interference by the prosecution with the defense all combine to put the fairness of the proceedings in doubt. In the aftermath of the sentencing, Jones said she was concerned that the Malaysian government would try to prevent rallies and demonstrations and otherwise curb the right of Anwar supporters to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association.

The report comes on the eve of April 18 elections in Turkey, after a pre-election campaign period characterized by many of the kinds of violations described in the report, including the prosecution and harassment of Islamist and Kurdish political figures.  """"Elections are not the only measure of a democracy,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Some of Turkey's laws seriously infringe upon the right to free expression that is guaranteed under international law and are a sign that democracy and respect for human rights have a long way to go in Turkey.""""  According to the Human Rights Watch report, entitled """"Violations of Free Expression in Turkey,"""" Turkey enjoys a vibrant political and media culture in which many points of view can be expressed on most issues. No such freedom applies, however, to certain sensitive topics perceived as a threat to national security. Those who report or write on these topics risk repressive measures, including imprisonment, fines, or the closing and banning of their publications. Some journalists have even been killed by shadowy death squads believed linked to Turkish security forces.  In addition to restrictions on the media, political and educational rights are also circumscribed in Turkey. Political parties linked to the Kurdish and Islamist movements have been banned and use of the Kurdish language is prohibited in broadcasting and education. The Human Rights Watch report also describes violations of press freedom by the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey. PKK repression ranges from the kidnapping and murder of journalists to putting pressure on Kurdish-nationalist newspapers to practice self-censorship.  Human Rights Watch calls on the Turkish government to repeal and amend all laws that violate international human rights standards for free expression, including:  The preamble of the constitution, which states that, """"No protection shall be given to thoughts or opinions that run counter to Turkish national interests, the fundamental principle of the existence of the indivisibility of the Turkish state and territory, the historical and moral values of Turkishness, or the nationalism, principles, reforms, and modernism of Atatürk..."""" Provisions of the constitution that give prosecutors and others the right to confiscate publications without first obtaining a court order (Articles 28.5 and 28.7); that allow courts to close publications (Article 28.10 and additional Article 2 of the Press Law); or that prohibit publication in languages """"prohibited by law (Article 28.2)."""" Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which prohibits so-called """"separatist propaganda."""" Provisions of the penal code that prohibit publishing articles that """"make people unwilling to serve in the military (Article 155),"""" """"insult[ing] the President of the Republic (Article 158), """"insulting the moral personality of Turkishness, the Republic, the Parliament, the Government, State Ministers, the military or security forces, or the Judiciary (Article 159),"""" or """"incit[ing] people to enmity and hatred by pointing to class, racial, religious, confessional, or regional differences (Article 312.2)."""" Article 8 of the Police Duty and Responsibility Law, which gives police the administrative right to close down plays, films, or lectures.  The report also presses the United States government, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the European Union to raise concerns relating to restrictions on free expression with the Turkish government and to insist on improvements in this area as a condition for enhanced relations.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to press Pakistani authorities to guarantee their security. The organization called for the government of Pakistan to provide immediate protection for the two renowned activists, Hina Jilani and Asma Jehangir, threatened with death for their defense of a twenty-nine year old woman murdered by her family for trying to obtain a divorce.  Ironically, Ms. Jehangir is also the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Killings.  The death threats were issued by a number of religious groups, most notably the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam, and backed by a group of individuals who are members of the Peshawar Chamber of Commerce. The threats follow upon the """"honor killing"""" of twenty-nine year old Samia Sarwar, daughter of Haji Ghulam Sarwar, president of the Peshawar Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Sarwar was seeking a divorce and was shot to death in the chambers of Jilani and Jehangir, her lawyers. The killer was retained by her family and came to the office with her mother and paternal uncle. He also shot at Jilani, narrowly missing her. In the wake of the attack, Jilani and Jehangir have received death threats from Mr. Sarwar and his supporters, who have reportedly offered a reward to anyone who assassinates them. Despite public protests and demonstrations, Pakistani authorities have yet to make arrests in the case. """"It's outrageous that the culprits remain free and publicly visible,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Even worse, they are actively threatening and harassing Samia Sarwar's attorneys.""""  Pakistani authorities have traditionally taken a lenient stance on so-called """"honor killings."""" In many cases perpetrators are not prosecuted. Those who are brought before the courts often receive disproportionately light sentences.  """"This murderous custom must stop.

On April 9, Bao Tong was visited at his home in Beijing by four officials of the Public Security Bureau (PSB). Their visit was a direct response to a letter Bao Tong had sent to President Jiang Zemin and other top leaders on March 25, 1999 calling for a reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 student demonstrations. The letter received widespread attention in the international press. The PSB officials told him that his letter """"endangered state security."""" The crime of """"endangering state security"""" has been used against many critics of the government. Although the public security officials made it clear that their visit this time was only a warning and did not necessarily mean that Bao Tong was in imminent danger of arrest, it was clearly an effort to intimidate him.  """"We urge the Chinese government to fully respect Bao Tong's right to free speech,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"He should not be subjected to threats and intimidation simply for expressing his views.""""  Jones noted that the threats to Bao Tong have come only a week before a U.S.-sponsored resolution censoring China's human rights practices will be tabled at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.  The PSB officals told Bao Tong that he should support the decisions of the late leader, Deng Xiaoping, including the order to use army troops to suppress the """"counterrevolutionary rebellion"""" in Beijing in June 1989. Bao Tong, in his letter, called """"using hundreds of thousands of troops to crack down on unarmed students and civilians"""" nothing short of """"shameful to humanity."""" Bao Tong was also informed that his application for a passport, enabling him to travel abroad, was rejected because he is aware of too much information that remains classified and could damage state security by traveling abroad. A senior government and Party official credited with major contributions to economic reform, Bao Tong spent seven years in prison and one year under house arrest for opposing Deng Xiaoping's decision to crack down on the pro-democracy movement in 1989. After his political rights were restored in May 1998, Bao Tong began to express his differences with Party policy to the foreign press and was repeatedly warned by security officials to be more discreet.

The report, Broken People: Caste Violence Against India's """"Untouchables,"""" calls on the Indian government to disband private militias and implement national legislation to prevent and prosecute caste-based attacks.  Untouchability"""" was abolished under India's constitution in 1950. Yet entire villages in many Indian states remain completely segregated by caste, in what has been called """"hidden apartheid."""" Untouchables, or Dalits -- the name literally means """"broken"""" people -- may not enter the higher-caste sections of villages, may not use the same wells, wear shoes in the presence of upper castes, visit the same temples, drink from the same cups in tea stalls, or lay claim to land that is legally theirs. Dalit children are frequently made to sit in the back of classrooms. Dalit villagers have been the victims of many brutal massacres in recent years.  """"'Untouchability' is not an ancient cultural artifact, it is human rights abuse on a vast scale,"""" said Smita Narula, researcher for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"The tools for change are in place -- what is lacking is the political will for their implementation."""" Human Rights Watch is an international human rights monitoring organization based in New York. Since the early 1990s, violence against Dalits has escalated dramatically in response to growing Dalit rights movements. The release of the 291-page report today is timed to coincide with the birthday of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian constitution and revered Dalit leader who died in 1956. The National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, the first of its kind in history, will be marking the occasion with rallies in ten states.  The report includes more than forty specific recommendations to the Indian government at the central and state level, many of them focused on implementing a 1989 law banning atrocities against Dalits. According to that law, it is illegal to force Dalits into bonded labor, deny them access to public places, foul their drinking water, force them to eat """"obnoxious substances,"""" or """"parade them naked or with painted face or body."""" The recommendations also call for the establishment of special courts and atrocities units to prosecute crimes against Dalits, and more women police personnel to register complaints by Dalit women.  """"The violence will only grow without these measures,"""" said Narula. """"It is a crisis that calls out for national and international attention.""""  At the international level, the report calls on India's donors and trading partners to build anti-discrimination measures into all aid projects where problems of caste violence are particularly severe. All of the recommendations were formulated in consultation with Indian activists involved in the National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, founded in 1998. Upper-caste employers frequently use caste as a cover for exploitative economic arrangements. With the exception of a minority who have benefited from India's policy of reservations (affirmative action), Dalits are relegated to the most menial tasks.  An estimated forty million people in India, among them fifteen million children, are bonded laborers, working in slave-like conditions in order to pay off debts. The majority of them are Dalits. At least one million Dalits work as manual scavengers, clearing feces from latrines and disposing of dead animals with their bare hands. Dalits also comprise the majority of agricultural laborers who work for a few kilograms of rice, or 15-35 rupees (less than US$1) a day.  In India's southern states, thousands of Dalit girls are forced to become prostitutes for upper-caste patrons and village priests before reaching the age of puberty. Landlords and the police use sexual abuse and other forms of violence against women to inflict political """"lessons"""" and crush dissent within the community. Dalit women have been arrested and tortured in custody to punish their male relatives who are hiding from the authorities. The report documents violence in the eastern state of Bihar and the southern state of Tamil Nadu. In Bihar, high-caste landlords have organized private militias, or senas, which have killed Dalit villagers with impunity. Extremist guerrilla groups have retaliated by killing high-caste villagers, leading to an escalating cycle of violence. Such attacks on civilians constitute violations of international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch has called for independent investigations into the killings and for the disarming of the militias.  One of the most prominent militias, the Ranvir Sena, has been responsible for the massacre of more than 400 Dalit villagers in Bihar between 1995 and 1999. Within a span of three weeks in January and February 1999, sena members killed 34 Dalit villagers in two separate attacks. On March 19, 1999, members of the Maoist Communist Centre, a guerrilla organization with low-caste supporters, beheaded 33 upper-caste villagers in retaliation for the sena killings. Both sides have threatened more """"revenge killings"""" in the weeks to come.  The senas, which claim many politicians as members, operate with impunity. In some cases, police have accompanied them during their attacks and have stood by as they killed villagers in their homes. In other cases, police raids have followed attacks by the senas. The purpose of the raids is often to terrorize Dalits as a group, whether or not they are members of guerilla organizations. During the raids, the police have routinely beaten villagers, sexually assaulted women, and destroyed property. Sena leaders and police officials have never been prosecuted for such killings and abuses.  Dalits throughout the country also suffer from de facto disenfranchisement. During elections, Dalits are routinely threatened and beaten by political party strongmen in order to compel them to vote for certain candidates. Dalits who run for political office in village councils and municipalities (through seats that have been constitutionally """"reserved"""" for them) have been threatened with physical abuse and even death to get them to withdraw from the campaign.  In the village of Melavalavu, Tamil Nadu, following the election of a Dalit to the village council presidency, members of a higher-caste group murdered six Dalits in June 1997, including the elected council president, whom they beheaded. As of February 1999, the accused murderers -- who had been voted out of their once-secure elected positions -- had not been prosecuted.  In cases investigated for this report, with the exception of a few transfers and suspensions, no action has been taken against police officers involved in violent raids or summary executions, or against those accused of colluding with private actors to carry out attacks on Dalits. In many instances, Dalits have repeatedly called for police protection and been ignored. Even national government agencies concur that impunity is rampant.  """"Talking about the problem is not enough,"""" said Narula. """"The Indian government must act now to demonstrate its stated commitment to ensuring equal rights for Dalits.""""","Asia, India","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Police, acting on the orders of a Santiago appeals court, raided the warehouse of the publishers, Planeta, and made off with the entire stock of the book, which had been launched the previous day. Planeta's general editor, Carlos Orellana, said yesterday he was expecting police to raid bookshops across the city in search of copies already on sale.  The Black Book of Chilean Justice is said to be a well-researched expose of corruption in the Chilean judiciary. It contains hitherto unpublished episodes involving senior justices, some of who are still in office, as well as a searing critique of the judiciary under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.  Within hours of the launch, one of the judges named, Servando Jordan Lopez, filed a petititon against the author for violating the Law of State Security (LSE). This law, which dates from 1958, makes it an imprisonable offence to publish statements considered defamatory by senior officials of the government, the armed forces and the judiciary.* The judge to whom Justice Jordan filed his complaint, Rafael Huerta of the Santiago Appeals Court, opened a prosecution against Matus, and ordered the seizure of the book, with what the press described as """"unusual celerity."""" Although the LSE does not explicitly empower judges to impound books, other Chilean laws give judges discretion to do so, at the request of any litigant filing a libel or defamation complaint. Fearing her imminent arrest, Matus took a plane to Argentina. Jordan reacted in an identical manner to press criticism last year. Two leading Chilean journalists, Fernando Paulsen Silva, then Director of Chile's bestselling newspaper, La Tercera, and La Tercera reporter Jose Ale, are still facing charges under the LSE for articles referring to the judge, who narrowly escaped impeachment in 1997 for corruption allegations. Two others were also charged for a humor article with an irrevereant reference to Jordan. They were later released after a wave of protest. Alejandra Matus is one of Chile's most distinguished young investigative journalists. She graduated from the Catholic University of Chile in 1987, began her career on the prestigious opposition weekly Hoy, and has subsequently worked on La Ultimas Noticias, Pluma y Pincel and Radio Nuevo Mundo. In 1990 she joined the staff of La Epoca, a now defunct newspaper which championed human rights during the last years of the military dictatorship, and in democracy. In 1996 El Pais awarded Matus and her colleague Francisco Artaza their annual Ortega y Gasset Prize for an investigation, originally published in La Nacion, of the murder in Washington of former Chilean foreign minister Orlando Letelier.  * See Human Rights Watch's November 1998 report  The Limits of Tolerance: Freedom of Expression and the Public Debate in Chile for a full analysis of the State Security Law and its grave effects on freedom of expression and government accountability.","Americas, Chile",""

The call came two days after one of these militias, apparently backed by East Timorese troops from the Indonesian army, killed a large number of pro-independence civilians who had sought refuge in the Catholic church in Liquisa, a town to the east of East Timor's capital, Dili. A human rights organization in Dili has collected a list of names of eighteen people killed in the attack on April 6; some estimates range as high as fifty-two. The local army commander has acknowledged five deaths. Violence by anti-independence militias has been increasing since the January 27 Indonesian government announcement that it was willing to consider the option of independence for the territory if the East Timorese people rejected its offer of greater autonomy.  """"Indonesia's donors can't just sit back and allow these attacks to continue,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. She acknowledged that pro-independence forces also had weapons, and some have been responsible for intimidation and harassment of independence opponents and non-Timorese alike. But she said the escalation of violence since January was directly attributable to the actions of anti-independence civilian militias, many of which have acquired new weapons in recent months, and it was increasingly clear that they were acting with the support of district and subdistrict military commands.  """"The failure to disarm these militias indicates either the inability or unwillingness of General Wiranto to take action against his own forces,"""" Jones said, referring to the Jakarta-based commander of the Indonesian armed forces. """"But the fact that there has been no visible effort thus far suggests a lack of political will."""" She also said that identification of who in the army was responsible for arming and training the militias might shed light on some of the violence that has wracked Indonesia proper over the last six months.  """"If a joint demarche has no effect, the donors should seriously consider upping the pressure, including making some aid disbursements conditional on disarming these militias,"""" Jones said.  The militia operating in the Liquica is known as Besi Merah Putih or """"Iron Rod for the Red-and-White."""" The red-and-white is another name for the Indonesian flag. Other militias operating at a district level include Mahidi (an acronym for """"Live or Die for Integration"""") in Ainaro; Alfa in Lautem; Makikit in Viqueque; Saka in Baucau; Ablai in Manufahi; Halilintar (""""Thunderbolt"""") in Bobonaro; Laksaur in Covalimal; Aitarak in Dili; and Sera in Manatuto. On April 8, all of the above held a rally in Maliana, East Timor, in support of continued integration with Indonesia.  The Halilintar and Saka militias have existed for years and have operated alongside the Indonesian army in military operations. Mahidi and Besi Merah Putih have both emerged in recent months. In January, human rights organizations and the local press reported that these militias, particularly those in western East Timor where pro-integration sentiment is stronger, had received new arms. General Wiranto denied at the time that the Indonesian army had supplied any new weapons to the groups.  Both immediately before and after the April 6 attack, human rights organizations working in the area, including the Dili-based Hak Foundation, were threatened by anti-independence groups, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has an office in Dili, said it was unable to reach Liquica because of the """"hostile environment"""" and security threats. General Wiranto has since invited the ICRC to investigate the killings.  A description of the attack in Liquica appeared in the Dili newspaper, Suara Timor Timur (Voice of East Timor), a translation of which is below.  The attack came a day after Xanana Gusmao, head of the East Timorese independent movement which includes the armed wing, Falintil, issued a statement calling on Falintil to take all steps necessary to defend the people of East Timor against attacks from the civilian militias. The statement was widely interpreted as an order to the rebels to resume the guerrilla war against the Indonesian army, although Xanana denied this. """"It wasn't a call to war but rather an appeal to the East Timorese to take the necessary precautions so that people are not killed arbitrarily,"""" he told a Jakarta reporter. The statement, issued from Jakarta where Gusmao is under house arrest, was in response to growing violence and an attack on April 5 by Besi Merah Putih in which seven people were wounded. A senior adviser to President Habibie, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, said on April 6 that a call to arms would make it difficult for consultations on autonomy to take place as scheduled in May.  *****  Translation from Voice of East Timor (Suara Timor Timur), April 8, 1999  [Editor's note: After receiving visits from Bishop Belo, the military commander of Korem 164, Col. Tono Suratman and the provincial police chief GM Timbul, the priest of Liquica parish, Rafael dos Santos, agreed to give a press conference. The conference took place at Bishop Belo's residence in Licidere, East Dili as follows:]  First, let me say that the two of us [Pastor Rafael dos Santos and Jose Daslan] were on the scene from Monday, April 5 to Tuesday, April 6. The pro-independence people from Liquica subdistrict did not want to be harassed by the pro-integration people from subdistrict Maubara. It's fine if the people of Maubara district want to be the base of Besi Merah Putih [BMP, the militia known as the Iron Rod for the Red-and-White] but just don't try to mobilize in Liquica. Because the BMP moved on Liquica on Monday, April 5, the people of Liquica made an effort to prevent them. On Monday, the people of Liquica manned the border [with Maubara] armed with traditional weapons such as arrows, swords, and spears.  At that time, members of BMP appeared in the middle of the main road near the border linking the towns of Maubara and Liquica. But members of the Koramil [subdistrict military command] from Maubara also appeared from every direction on the main road. They were under the command of Asep Kuswanto, the commander of KODIM [district military command] 1638, Liquica. As a result [of their actions] six people were shot. Youths from Liquica town wanted resist with arrows and spears but from all sides gunfire rang out, hitting seven youths. At that time, the youths ran toward the town of Liquica. But all over the town, beginning at 13:00, the sounds of gunshots could be heard. It was the Liquica KODIM and the police command [polres] doing the shooting.  The shooting by police and soldiers went on for about one hour. People were terrified and ran into the church. After the shooting, the BMP entered Liquica, shouting as they did so. They all entered the compound of the Liquica KODIM. How was that possible? Who is behind them? I don't know about other places, but I know for a fact that in Liquica it was the members of KODIM who were backing them.  Yesterday, April 6, the person who took me from my house was a man with a pistol. We tried to make contact with the head (commander) of BMP, Manuel Sousa, as well as the bupati of Liquica Leoneto Martanis, and Eurico Gutteres as a middleman, but it didn't work. Leoneto and Manuel Sousa are said to be still very emotional, so they don't want to conduct a dialogue with me to look for a way out and help the thousands of people now staying around the church to go back to their homes. At the time, Brimob [the riot police] came and surrounded the church fence. They said they wanted to make things safe for the pastor or the people. I don't know about this. But about 13:00, members of Besi Merah Putih wanted to attack the people who were in the parish houses around the church.  At first, the police shot tear gas into the church. Then, they periodically fired shots in the air. Members of Brimob shot into the air while members of BMP shot at the people in the church. The shooting of Brimob into the air gave a chance for BMP to enter the church grounds, then BMP began to massacre the people with arrows and spears. The people hit by the tear gas ran outside with their eyes closed, then the BMP members hacked them. The name of this is murder.  The aim of the BMP was to kill all the people in the area of the church, while those who had hidden on the upper floor of the parish house were shot by the army and Brimob while I was brought outside. Those who were hiding upstairs and in my bathroom were murdered. They were Kades Dato, Jacinto da Costa Conceicao Pereira, Agustinhu, Victor, Leovigildo (a junior high school student) and Lucio. Before this, Laurindo, head of the government fisheries office for Liquica, and Herminio were killed by members of the Maubara subdistrict command (Koramil) in their homes.  The mastermind of these murders did not use Javanese soldiers but rather East Timorese native sons, members of the Maubara Koramil. Only certain soldiers were given arms and joined with the BMP to kill the people. I and Pastor Jose were also targeted for killing, but the traditional weapons of the BMP didn't go off. ABRI claims that there were two firearms in the house. I told two policemen that Jacinto and his son were only carrying knives when they entered the church grounds. ABRI said the two guns were the reason that the BMP and the army killed all those people. The intention of the BMP in coming to Liquica was to kill all the leaders of the pro-independence movement in Liquica.  The people taking shelter in the church compound numbered more than 2,000. I saw myself that there were seven victims killed in the parish house. After the two of us were brought to the CODIAEUM, the killing got even more brutal and sadistic. If the area commander Col. Tono is saying only five were killed, then what about the youths and old people killed in the parish house? The problem is we don't know where the corpses are. I have no idea. At night I heard the sounds of a """"Hino"""" vehicle in the church. We have to know where the bodies area. I came home from the CODIAEUM about 19:00, but when I got home, the bodies weren't there. All that was left was blood all over, including in my bedroom.  At the same time, about Rp.8 million belonging to the Liquica Catholic school that Pastor Jose was saving have disappeared. Money for alms was also looted. The BMP took the motorcycle belonging to Pastor Jose and several other cars and took them to Maubara. Church documents in a cupboard were also damaged and the contents of the house were destroyed. The military and the government must take responsibility for the killing and for the looting in Liquica church and in private homes in Liquica.  Three Eyewitnesses An eyewitness, one of 18 [sic, see below] people hidden in the church at the time the massacre was taking place, told STT yesterday that around 18:45, they saw six Hino trucks taking bodies away from the church. The bodies were thrown on top of the trucks and taken to a destination that remains unknown. The witness, who was reluctant to give his name, added that the massacre was carried out by members of the BMP, army, regular police, and Brimob.  They shot and hacked at people as though they were killing animals. Even when people were raising their arms to surrender, they were still shot and hacked. We could only watch and weep from the church, he said. He said that there were 16 witnesses hiding in the church, 8 women and 8 men.

The windows, the roof are shattered, while the contents of the house were destroyed or looted by the BMP. There was blood in the bathroom and bedroom. Liquica is in a state of paralysis. All along the main road of Tibar village up to the town of Liquica, you see the Indonesian flag [the Red-and-White] displayed. According to one villager, anyone who didn't hang a flag ran the risk of being hacked to death by the army or BMP. Those against the Red-and-White were forced to flee to the forest or outside of Liquica.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia",""

In an open letter to Indian president K.R. Narayanan, the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee called on the government to launch an investigation into reports of politically motivated censorship at the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute, a government-funded Asian studies center in Calcutta. Researchers at the Azad Institute and other Indian academics report a number of troubling developments since appointees of the Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the institute in November 1998 and named Dr. B.P. Saha, a retired policeman, as new director of the institute. Since his appointment, Dr. Saha has halted the publication of academic articles and a book-length study of border issues in the region, and he has restricted researchers from attending outside seminars without his permission. Publicly he has emphasized that he is merely ensuring that institute staff are """"accountable,"""" but in meetings with institute staff he reportedly has cited his displeasure that work at the institute has not been adequately promoting the greatness of Hindu India.  """"At best, the circumstances are suspicious and demand an investigation,"""" said Joseph Saunders, who tracks academic freedom for Human Rights Watch. """"It is important to take the allegations seriously because pressure on academics to toe the line is often a warning sign of more insidious forms of censorship to come.""""  The letter was signed on behalf of the committee by Jonathan F. Fanton, president of the New School University in New York and a co-chair of the committee. The committee membership includes internationally prominent academic leaders and scholars, including presidents of Harvard University, Columbia University and over a dozen other universities in the United States, and figures such as Lord Ralf Dahrendorf, formerly of St. Antony's College at Oxford and currently a governor at the London School of Economics, Krzysztof Michalski of the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, Ariel Dorfman of Duke University, John Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard University, and Fang Lizhi of the University of Arizona.  A copy of the letter follows.  ****  April 9, 1999  Mr. K.R. Narayanan President Rashtrapati Bhawan New Delhi 110001 India Dear President Narayanan:  I am writing this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to express the committee's concern over reports of censorship at the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute for Asian Studies in Calcutta. We urge that you immediately initiate a fair and impartial investigation into the case and do everything in your power to restore academic freedom at the institute.  The Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute was established by the Indian government in 1993 and continues to be funded by the central government. About eleven researchers are affiliated with the institute, six or seven of whom work full time there. In addition to conducting research into issues concerning India's relations with its Asian neighbors, researchers and other institute staff have been involved in organizing academic conferences and an orientation for M.Phil and Ph.D students in West Bengal. The Azad Institute is managed by an executive council, the members of which are appointed by the central government. In March 1998 existing council members' terms expired, and, in August and September 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government for the first time appointed its own slate of council members. We are concerned with the way the newly constituted council has exercised its power over the past six months.  According to reports we have received from institute staff and other Indian academics, the council in November 1998 named retired policeman Dr. B.P. Saha as new director of the institute. The council did not formulate requirements for the post or announce a search for a new director prior to naming Dr. Saha, and it ignored a search committee that had been set up under the prior council. The appointment of Dr. Saha also directly contradicted a resolution of the previously constituted search committee that the nominee should be a professor. The selection process entirely by-passed Dr. Ranabir Samaddar, who at the time was serving as professor-in-charge of the institute.  Since becoming director, Dr. Saha reportedly has applied strong-arm tactics to prevent the institute from continuing with work-in-progress and has pressured researchers to toe a partisan nationalist line. He suspended the publication of institute papers and of a volume edited by Dr. Samaddar on the theme of geopolitics, borders, and the state. The latter publication was based on the proceedings of a seminar in Delhi organized by the Azad Institute which featured the participation of the Indian foreign secretary and other dignitaries. At meetings with institute staff, Saha reportedly criticized institute researchers for not promoting the greatness of Hindu India.  Dr. Saha also issued orders that researchers not attend seminars, discussions, or lecture programs at any outside institution without his prior permission, and told the institute's academic and research scholars that all papers and articles must have his prepublication approval. Researchers allege that the policy has been applied selectively to prevent those who disagree with Saha's nationalist views from attending outside seminars.  The restrictions on researchers and the suspension of publications create the appearance that political criteria have replaced academic criteria as the basis for decisions at the institute. The appearance alone is damaging to the international reputation of the institute and warrants action by your office.  In justifying the restrictions, Dr. Saha has stated that he is simply exercising his prerogatives in ensuring the accountability of scholars at the Azad Institute. Academic accountability is a worthy objective but efforts to achieve it must carefully be insulated from political considerations. The concept is easily abused: the world's most repressive governments commonly invoke accountability to justify imposing stifling political controls on academic inquiry.  Freedom of expression is defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, acceded to by India in 1979, as including freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds."""" This freedom is essential to academic excellence. A university fulfills its mission when academics are not forced to support an official line, an economic agenda, or a political ideology, but rather are free to use their talents to advance human knowledge and understanding.  As academics and human rights advocates, it is not our intention to support or dispute the opinions, ideas, or research findings of the academics whose cases we discuss. It is, however, a central feature of our mandate to defend their right to express their views and to study, research, teach, and publish without interference. Academic institutions do not exist in a political vacuum and it is not uncommon in times of political upheaval and change, such as that India is now experiencing, for there to be increased pressure for orthodoxy in academic matters. International human rights law makes it the duty of governments to forcefully resist such pressures.  Accordingly, we urge that you immediately launch an independent investigation of the actions of the executive council and policies of the new director of the Azad Institute.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. We look forward to your reply.

In a letter to the Home Secretary, Human Rights Watch, which was authorized by the House of Lords to take part in the case, listed 111 cases of torture allegedly committed under General Pinochet's command after September 1988, the date when Britain enacted the United Nations Torture Convention. The letter also cited Britain's legal obligation under the Torture Convention to extradite or prosecute General Pinochet. """"Torture in Chile was systematic but more selective at the end of Pinochet's rule,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Lords gave the green light to charges that Pinochet conspired to torture his political opponents, and this conspiracy was still very much in place in 1988."""" """"By 1988, it was much less necessary for General Pinochet to use torture to maintain political control in Chile,"""" said Brody, who attended all of the Law Lords' hearings on the issue. """"But the repressive apparatus he set up was still intact, and torture was still used when they felt they needed to use it."""" Of the 111 cases of alleged torture listed by Human Rights Watch in the 18-month period from October 1988 to March 1990, 41 victims were subject to electric shock. Twelve of the victims died after torture. At least 42 of the torture victims were arrested for political reasons. Human Rights Watch also referred to the hundreds of unresolved cases of """"disappearances"""" of Pinochet's opponents. """"These crimes are legally considered to continue as long as the fate of those `disappeared' is concealed,"""" said Brody. """"That means they are on-going crimes after 1988, until today."""" The letter noted that a key purpose of the Torture Convention was to deny a """"safe haven"""" to those accused of torture. In November 1998, a U.N. panel reminded the British government that under the pact it would have to initiate a prosecution against General Pinochet if it did not extradite him. The Home Secretary invited all the parties in the Pinochet case to make submissions by today and has said that he will decide by April 15 whether to renew his """"authority to proceed"""" with the extradition case. The Law Lords ruled that the ex-dictator could only be extradited for crimes committed after September 1988.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

Augusto Pinochet.     Human Rights Watch was granted permission by the House of Lords to intervene in both sets of proceedings before it relating to General Pinochet. On 16 November 1998, we wrote to you to urge that you take the principled actions necessary to ensure that General Pinochet was extradited to Spain. At that time, we suggested that the reasonable exercise of your discretion under the Extradition Act required that you take into account the gravity of General Pinochet's offenses, the impunity which General Pinochet would continue to enjoy on returning to Chile, and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law.  On 9 December 1998, you signed an authority to proceed in respect of General Pinochet for the crimes of torture, conspiracy to commit to torture and other charges. You are now reviewing that decision in light of the House of Lords' Judgment of 24 March 1999. We respectfully urge that the factors leading to your decision of 9 December still maintain and require that you issue a new authority to proceed.     This letter contains three annexes: 1 - Torture in Chile 1988-1989; 2 - Table of 111 cases of Torture in Chile 1988-1989; 3 - Statement of Ambassador Roberto Garretón of 12 January 1999 submitted to the House of Lords.     1. Pursuant to the United Nations Torture Convention, the United Kingdom is required to Extradite or Prosecute General Pinochet     """"The purpose of the Convention was to introduce the principle aut dedere aut punire--either you extradite or you punish.""""     (Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, p. 15.)     A central purpose of the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the United Kingdom, Chile and Spain are parties, was the establishment of universal jurisdiction in order to deny a """"safe haven"""" to those accused of torture. Under Article 5, the United Kingdom is required to extradite an alleged perpetrator of torture who is present on its territory, or it must """"submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.""""     According to the Dutch Chairman of the United Nations Working Group entrusted with drafting the convention, and the Swedish Ambassador who prepared the text of the Convention's first draft, this article is:     """"a cornerstone in the Convention, an essential purpose of which is to ensure that a torturer does not escape the consequences of his acts by going to another country. As with previous conventions against terrorism, .... the present Convention is also based on the principle aut dedere aut punire; in other words, the country where the suspected offender happens to be shall either extradite him for the purpose of prosecution or proceed against him on the basis of its own criminal law.""""     (J. Herman Burgers and Hans Danelius, The United Nations Convention against Torture; A Handbook on the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, p. 131.)     These provisions create the """"obligation either to extradite alleged torturers or to try them on the basis of universality of jurisdiction."""" (Sir Nigel Rodley, The Treatment of Prisoners in International Law 2d Ed, 1999, p. 129.)     The United Nations Committee against Torture referred to these provisions on 19 November 1998 when it recommended to the United Kingdom """"that in the case of Senator Pinochet of Chile, the matter be referred to the office of the public prosecutor, with a view to examining the feasibility of and if appropriate initiating criminal proceedings in England, in the event that the decision is made not to extradite him. This would satisfy the State party's obligations under articles 4 to 7 of the Convention and article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969."""" (Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 17/11/98. CAT/C/UK.)     The fact that most of the charges against General Pinochet have been ruled out by the Lords is not relevant to these obligations. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson pointed out, """"A single act of official torture is 'torture' within the convention."""" (Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, p. 15.)     2. The """"conspiracy to commit torture"""" from 1988-90 was part of General Pinochet's wide-ranging plan to torture and eliminate political opponents which began in 1973. In the latter years of Pinochet's rule, torture in Chile was """"systematic but more selective.""""     """"[I]t is important not to lose sight of the fact that the case which is being made against Senator Pinochet by the Spanish judicial authorities is that each act of torture has to be seen in the context of a continuing conspiracy to commit torture. As a whole, the picture which is presented is of a conspiracy to commit widespread and systematic torture and murder in order to obtain control of the government and, having done so, to maintain control of government by those means for as long as might be necessary.""""     """"[T]he fact that these [conspiracy] allegations remain available for the remainder of the period is important because of the light which they cast on the single act of torture alleged in charge 30.""""     (Lord Hope of Craighead, Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, pp. 46, 58.)     Chile's official National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation has found that in the latter years of General Pinochet's rule, the """"use of torture was systematic, but more selective"""" than in the early period, when the first secret police, the DINA, """"tortured practically everyone who passed through some of its secret facilities."""" (Volume 2, Chap. 3, A.1.d., p. 644 of English translation.) By 1988, of course, the political situation was very different and it was much less necessary for General Pinochet to use torture to maintain political control in Chile.     The cases of official torture after September (December) 1988, while more selective than before, were the product of the same official plan to commit abuses against General Pinochet's opponents. These plans are summarized in the extradition request:     """"Mr. Pinochet Ugarte from his position of command, created and led in coordination with others who were responsible, military and civil, in Chile, the Argentine and other countries of the Southern Cone of the Americas a criminal Internacional [sic] organisation whose only purpose was to conspire, develop, and execute a systematic, criminal plan of illegal detentions, kidnappings, tortures followed by death, the forced displacement of thousands of people and the forced disappearance of some four thousand people of diverse nationalities - Chilean, Argentinian, Brasilian, Spanish, English, North-American, and others, for the purpose of achieving a series of politico-economic objectives which reaffirmed the bases of the conspiracy and instilled terror in the population as they witnessed the systematic elimination of all their leaders who were not in agreement with and were opposed to the criminal plan which had been designed.""""     (Bound Record, Vol. 2, p. 294)     The Ad-Hoc Working Group on Chile commissioned by the United Nations General Assembly to monitor human rights conditions in Chile following the military coup made clear in its 1977 report that General Pinochet promoted torture as a means of political control.     """"Torture has become an integral component of the system of intimidation. The refusal of the Chilean authorities to prosecute and punish those responsible for torture . . . reveals clear official support from the highest level and that in Chile, torture is still practiced as a powerful weapon of intimidation and political persecution."""" [unofficial HRW translation from Spanish]1     In comparison with other military dictatorships in the region at the time, the system of rule introduced in Chile was uniquely centralized. As part of this plan, General Pinochet and the other junta members exerted hierarchical responsibility for all branches of the security forces until the end of the military government. The CNI, the main instrument of repression, was headed by an army general directly subordinate to the commander-in-chief, General Pinochet. Investigaciones, formally under the Ministry of Defense, implemented General Pinochet's orders on all matters of national security. General Rudolfo Stange, director general of Chile's militarized police force (Carabineros) was a member of the military junta. As the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation concluded,     """"[W]hat emerged was a new institution endowed with powers unprecedented in Chile: the President of the Republic/Commander-in-chief. The person holding this position not only ruled and administered the country but also presided over the government junta.... [H]e also commanded the entire army. The use of states of emergency during practically the whole period of military rule further deepened and extended such power...[W]hat was supposed to be the regime of the armed forces and police escaped from the collective control of these institutions and even from the control of their top leaders. Instead it became rigidly centralized around the president/commander-in-chief.""""     (Volume 1, part 2 Chap. 1, b.3, p. 64 of English translation.)     It was this centralized apparatus which remained in place until the end of the military regime. As Human Rights Watch reported in November 1989:     """"In the year since the plebiscite [of October 1998], while the incidence of severe abuses of human rights has declined, quick resurgences at delicate moments indicate that the apparatus of repression remains intact; the level of politically-related violence and intimidation in Chile remains disturbingly high, given the circumstances of a political opening; in short, it is not possible to state that the policy of repression has been abandoned.""""     (Americas Watch, Chile in Transition: Human Rights Since the Plebiscite 1988-1989, p. 9, Nov. 1989.) (emphasis added).     The opinion of the Special Rapporteur on Chile, Abdoulaye Dieye, appointed by the Commission on Human Rights to continue the work of the Ad-Hoc Working Group, made a similar assessment regarding torture:     """"Chilean authorities continue to inflict this type of treatment upon detainees and they tend to give it a permanent and institutional character as a part of the activities of their security organizations."""" [unofficial HRW translation from Spanish]2     In his 1989 report, covering the first six months of 1989, the new Special Rapporteur Fernando Volio indicated that:     """"Torture is still practiced, notwithstanding that it is applied on a smaller scale and in a more selective fashion. The Special Rapporteur considers that as long as the practice of torture is not halted, the human rights situation in Chile will conspire against the desire of the Chilean people to construct a political democratic system."""" [unofficial HRW translation from Spanish] 3     These statements all stress the systematic nature of torture and its role within a policy of political repression.     A similar conclusion was reached by Chile's official National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation:     """"... it can be stated with certainty that, during the final years of the military regime, the political structure that had been established by the enactment and implementation of the 1980 Constitution did not eliminate the national problem of serious and constant violations of human rights (although the frequency and numbers of victims admittedly declined). Indeed the 1978 amnesty, which its civilian promoters may well have regarded as the closing of the book on a now superseded problem, ultimately seemed to entail impunity for the past and to promise impunity for the future.""""     (Volume 1, Part 2, Chap. 2, A2, p. 71 of English translation.)     Indeed, the democratic government of Chile, in an official report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture in 1994 asserted that:     """"The termination of permanent 'states of constitutional exception,' the institutional framework which made torture possible under the previous regime, has contributed to a change of attitude on the part of the courts regarding their duty to watch over the lawfulness of detention through the due processing of habeas corpus applications.""""     (Committee Against Torture, Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 19 of the Convention, Chile, 16 February 1994, CAT/C20/Add.3, para. 6) (emphasis added).     Visiting Chile after the restoration of democracy, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, Mr. (now Sir) Nigel S. Rodley, reported:     """"A profound difference from that period was the real commitment of the civilian Governments to human rights and, in particular, to the need to eliminate the perpetration of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by officials of the State.""""     (Report of the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Nigel S. Rodley, Visit by the Special Rapporteur to Chile, E/CN.4/1996/35/Add.2, 4 December 1995, para. 71.)     3. The acts of torture committed by authorities under General Pinochet's command from September (or December) 1988 to 1990 were numerous and severe.     The House of Lords ruled that General Pinochet could be extradited only for the extradition crimes of torture and conspiracy to commit torture after September or December 1988.4Although several Lords referred only to the """"draft charges,"""" listing one such case of torture (that of Marcos Quezada Yañez), Lord Hope noted three such cases in the Extradition request (p. 59). In fact, the Spanish Indictment refers to at least five other such cases. These are (with numbering as in the Indictment--""""Documents to be Held in Readiness: Copy/Indictment""""):     751- Magni Camino, Cecilia (number 9 in annex 2)     765- Pellegrin Friedmann, Raul Alejandro, M (number 10 in annex 2)     2085- Caceres Peña, Lincoyan Nery (number 46 in annex 2)     2419- Salas Rojas, Jorge Antonio Marcelo (number 1 in annex 2)     2472 - Vargas Miranda Luis Orlando (number 73 in annex 2)     In addition, Human Rights Watch has details of 111 alleged cases of torture in the eighteen month period from September 1988 to March 1990 committed by Chilean authorities under General Pinochet's command. See Annex 2. Of these 111 cases, drawn from Chilean rights groups, 41 victims were subjected to electric shock torture. At least 42 victims, though probably more, were political detainees. Twelve people died after their torture.     According to the U.S. State Department, in 1988, """"[t]orture remain[ed] one of the most serious, persistent human rights problems in Chile."""" (U.S. State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1988 at 486.)     4. The hundreds of """"disappearances"""" alleged in the Extradition Request constitute acts of torture--extradition crimes--continuing beyond September (or December) 1988.     The Extradition request alleges several hundreds of acts of forced disappearances carried out under General Pinochet's orders. These are cases in which persons, usually Pinochet's political opponents, were abducted by security forces who then simply denied the arrest or falsely claimed to have freed the prisoners. The prisoners were never heard from again. Chile's official National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation found that behind most of the 957 documented cases of """"disappearance"""" was """"a politically motivated and systematically implemented effort to exterminate particular categories of persons."""" (Vol. 1, Part 1, Chap. 2, B 2b p.36 of English version). According to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, """"The vast majority of the 912 reported cases of disappearance in Chile occurred between 1973 and 1976 under the military government, and concerned political opponents of the military dictatorship from various social strata, most of them activists in Chilean left-wing parties. Those responsible for the disappearances were members of the army, the air force, the Carabineros and persons acting with the acquiescence of the authorities."""" (U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1999/62, 28 December 1998, para. 76.)     International law considers such """"disappearances"""" to be continuing crimes as long as the fate of the """"disappeared"""" remains hidden. Moreover, """"disappearances"""" are a form of torture as regards the loved ones of the """"disappeared"""" person and potentially as regards the """"disappeared person.""""     The U.N. Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance adopted in General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 states that """"Acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be considered a continuing offence as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the fate and the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remain unclarified."""" (Article 17). The Inter-American Convention on the Forced Disappearance of Persons, adopted by the OAS General Assembly on 9 June 1994 (not in force), similarly provides that """"The offense shall be deemed continuous or permanent as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim has not been determined."""" (Art. III). As Sir Nigel Rodley has pointed out, """"[t]he idea of 'disappearances' constituting a continuing offence is logical, since non-acknowledgment of the detention and non-disclosure of the fate or whereabouts of a detained person are key elements in the offence itself."""" (Nigel Rodley, """"The UN Draft Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,"""" paper presented at the International Conference on Political Killings and Disappearances, organized by Amnesty International, Amsterdam, 1992, p.18.)     These international definitions """"mak[e] the investigation (and punishment) of this crime possible at any time, provided the fate of the victim is unknown."""" (Brody and Gonzalez, """"Nunca Màs: An Analysis of International Instruments on Forced Disappearance of Persons,"""" 19 Human Rights Quarterly 365, May 1997.)     The U.N. Declaration on Enforced Disappearance also makes clear that """"Any act of enforced disappearance...constitutes a violation of the rules of international law guaranteeing, inter alia...the right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."""" (Art. 1). The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has taken several decisions on individual petitions which indicate that """"disappearances"""" amount to torture. In Quinteros v Uruguay, the Committee found that the mother of a """"disappeared"""" woman, who suffered """"anguish and stress...by the disappearance of her daughter and by the continuing uncertainty concerning her fate and whereabouts,"""" is """"a victim of the violations of the Covenant, in particular of article 7 [torture and cruel and inhuman treatment], suffered by her daughter."""" (107/1981, para.14). See also El-Megreisi v Libya (detainee, """"by being subjected to prolonged incommunicado detention in an unknown location, is the victim of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment."""") (Report of the Human Rights Committee, Vol.II, GAOR, 49th Session, Supplement 40 (1994) , Annex IX T, paras 2.1-2.5); Mojica v. Dominican Republic (""""the disappearance of persons is inseparably linked to treatment that amounts to a violation of article 7"""") (449/1991, para 5.7)     The European Court of Human Rights has also held that the extreme pain and suffering inflicted on the mother of the """"disappeared"""" person violated Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Kurt v. Turkey, Eur.Ct.Hum.Rts, Case No.15/1997/799/1002, 25 May 1998, para.134). Similarly, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in the well-known case of Velazquez Rodriguez, held that """"the mere subjugation of an individual to prolonged isolation and deprivation of communication is in itself cruel and inhuman treatment."""" (Inter-American Court H.R., Velásquez Rodríguez Case, Judgment of July 29, 1988. Series C Nº 4, para.187) Thus Sir Nigel Rodley recently concluded that """"there is a trend towards recognizing that to make someone 'disappear' is a form of prohibited torture or ill-treatment, clearly as regards the relatives of the 'disappeared' person and, arguably, in respect of the disappeared person him or herself."""" (Rodley, The Treatment of Prisoners in International Law, second edition, 1999, p. 261.)     The definition of torture under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 is the same as that under the Torture Convention as interpreted in the U.N. decisions. See opinion of Lord Hope of Craighead, Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, p. 55, (Section 134 to be """"[r]ead with the broad definition which the expression """"torture"""" has been given by Article 1 of the Convention). See also opinion of Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, p. 14 (""""The answer to both questions [who is """"a public official or a person acting in an official capacity"""" in the Convention and in section 134] must be the same."""") These hundreds of acts of disappearance are thus extradition crimes of torture which continue past September (or December) 1998.     5. There is No Real Prospect that General Pinochet Can Be Prosecuted in Chile     Chilean officials have suggested that General Pinochet could stand trial in Chile for the acts in question, and therefore that he may face criminal sanctions even if the United Kingdom fails to extradite him to Spain. Chile has not, however, drawn up charges against Pinochet or requested the General's extradition. As Lord Millet wrote:     """"Chile insists on the exclusive right to prosecute him. The Torture Convention, however, gives it only the primary right. If it does not seek his extradition (and it does not) then the United Kingdom is obliged to extradite him to another requesting state or prosecute him itself.""""     Ex Parte Pinochet, Judgment of 24 March 1999, p. 105.     In any event, there are overwhelming legal and practical obstacles which leave virtually no possibility that Pinochet will be prosecuted and convicted by a Chilean court for his alleged crimes. (Statement of Ambassador Roberto Garretón Annex 3). At present there are some twelve cases pending against the General in Chile, all for acts committed before 1978. These cases cannot, however, be prosecuted through to a conviction. (Id.)     A first barrier to any prosecution in Chile of General Pinochet is the April 1978 amnesty from prosecution that the Chilean military granted itself for crimes committed between September 1973 and March 1978 -- the period encompassing the majority of Pinochet's crimes. In 1996, and again in 1998, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found that this amnesty decree violated the terms of the American Convention on Human Rights, the region's comprehensive human rights treaty. Indeed, the Commission chastised the democratic government of Chile for failing to eliminate the amnesty from the books. (Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Report No. 36/96, 15 October 1996, and Report No.25/98, March 2, 1998). Yet, disregarding the self-amnesty's clear inconsistency with international norms, the Chilean Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld its validity. (see Annex 3).     In addition to the self-amnesty, and in respect to all alleged crimes committed to this day, General Pinochet enjoys immunity from prosecution under Chilean law as """"senator-for-life"""" and, in contradiction with international norms, immunity from civil and criminal liability because his acts were committed while he was head of state. The Chilean Supreme Court theoretically could strip him of this immunity if it found him guilty of criminal acts. But since the military left office in 1990, the court has never deprived a member of congress of immunity, and there has been no judicial ruling in Chile that ever stripped a head of state of his immunity. (see Annex 3).     A final obstacle to the prosecution of General Pinochet in Chile is the likelihood that, as commander-in-chief at the time of his crimes, he would be tried before a military tribunal. Military courts in Chile are staffed by current and former military officers whom Pinochet either promoted or appointed. They have an unbroken record of preventing the prosecution of any military official for crimes committed during the 1973 coup and its aftermath. A move in November 1998 to name a Supreme Court justice to investigate the cases against Pinochet, thus barring military jurisdiction, was decisively rejected by the Supreme Court. (see Annex 3).     Conclusion     Given the gravity of General Pinochet's offenses of torture and conspiracy to commit torture, the impunity he enjoys in Chile, and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law, we respectfully submit that your previous decision to authorize extradition to proceed is both justified and required.     Sincerely,   Reed Brody   Advocacy Director          [1] """"La tortura se ha convertido en parte integrante del sistema de la intimidación de las personas.

For Lord Browne-Wilkinson, the immunity ended on 8 December 1998 (p. 21). For Lord Goff of Chieveley, Pinochet never lost his immunity. Lord Hope of Craighead considered """"the date as from which immunity...was lost was 30 October 1988,"""" but was """"content to accept the view of Lord Saville"""" that the immunity continued until 8 December 1988 (pp. 68-69). Lord Hutton placed the date at 29 September 1988 (p. 89), and Lord Saville of Newdigate at 8 December 1988 (p. 92). For Lord Millett and Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Pinochet never enjoyed immunity. There is thus no majority.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

The group called for an immediate investigation into Monday's bombing of Aleksinac village, which reportedly killed five civilians and injured fifty.  """"The countries of the NATO alliance must take all steps to minimize civilian casualties in times of war,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Warfare has its unintended tragic consequences. But now the alliance must take visible and deliberate steps to make sure that these are minimized. This includes holding accountable those who might have made such a mortal mistake."""" On Monday evening, three NATO missiles were reported to have landed in a civilian neighborhood of Aleksinac, a village about 100 miles south of Belgrade, killing five civilians. NATO regretted the loss of life and called the incident an accident of war. The intended target, NATO said, was a military barracks positioned nearby. International humanitarian law is the set of rules governing the conduct of parties to international and internal armed conflicts. It is comprised of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their protocols, which are binding on all states and belligerents. The cornerstone of this body of law is the duty to protect the life, health and safety of civilians and other non-combatants such as soldiers who are wounded, captured, or who have laid down their arms. It is absolutely prohibited to attack, injure or deport such persons. All warring parties -- in this case Serbian and Yugoslav forces, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the NATO alliance -- bear a responsibility to take precautions, including doing everything feasible to verify targets are not civilian objects, minimizing incidental loss of civilian life, removing the civilian population from the vicinity of military objectives, effectively warning the civilian population in advance of attack unless circumstances do not permit, and avoiding locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas..It is forbidden at all times to direct attacks against civilians or civilian objects (such as places of worship, historic monuments, or hospitals). Parties to the conflict may not use civilians to shield military objectives from attack. Military objects are those that make an effective contribution to military action; where there is doubt, the object shall be presumed to be civilian. A corollary to civilian immunity is a basic prohibition on indiscriminate attacks. An attack is """"indiscriminate"""" when its effect cannot be limited and so harms military and civilian targets without distinction. Indiscriminate attacks include those which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and/or damage to civilian objects which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Typical examples include tactics such as carpet bombing populated areas which have military targets interspersed or laying land mines that will kill both soldiers and civilians for decades.

""""While Premier Zhu is here, President Clinton should publicly and privately reiterate the concerns he raised in Beijing last June,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch.  """"But he can also urge Zhu to address human rights issues beyond China's borders by condemning ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, supporting an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge  leadership, and ratifying international human rights treaties.""""  She noted that while Chinese officials often argue that human rights is an internal affair, China has repeatedly taken a stance on rights concerns abroad, from opposing apartheid in South Africa to condemning the treatment of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. China's treatment of its own citizens should be President Clinton's first priority, uman Rights Watch said. When President Clinton visited China, he spoke about the need for freedom of association, expression, and religion. He said the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square was wrong. He wondered aloud whether something could be done for some 2,000 prisoners serving sentences for """"counterrevolution,"""" a political crime wiped from the statutes last year. He raised the issue of Tibet.  In the intervening nine months since the Clinton visit, there has been no progress on any of these issues. Indeed, the Chinese government's intolerance of dissent has only intensified, as the Human Rights Watch chronology of developments over the last six months clearly shows. Not only have dozens of political activists been arrested, but as the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown on June 4 approaches, there has been a perceptible tightening of controls on the media and all forms of expression.  Jones applauded the Clinton administration's decision on March 26 to sponsor a resolution critical of China's human rights practices at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, now underway in Geneva, and urged the administration to lobby as hard to get the resolution passed as China will lobby to have it defeated. At the same time, the U.S. has been one of many countries urging China to participate more actively in the international system of human rights protection, even though the U.S.'s own participation, particularly in the realm of becoming a party to international treaties, is poor. President Clinton and Premier Zhu together could significantly strengthen that international system if they agreed to jointly advocate any or all of the following: an end to ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and a commitment to massive humanitarian aid for refugees in the Balkans. China's veto in the Security Council prevented the placement of U.N. monitors in Macedonia, and its own concerns over nationalist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang and over the independence movement in Taiwan have led it to take Serbia's side in the Kosovo conflict.  establishment of an international tribunal for the Khmer Rouge, a measure the Chinese government has publicly opposed.  ratification of two major international human rights treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. The U.S. has not ratified the latter, which President Carter signed in 1977. China, which signed both in the last two years, has not yet ratified them either.  signing of the December 1997 international treaty banning landmines and signing of the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court. China and the U.S. have been in a minority of the world's nations, opposing both. Premier Zhu will also be meeting with American business leaders in Chicago, New York, Washington and elsewhere during his U.S. tour. Human Rights Watch has encouraged business leaders to press for basic human rights improvements in China, including greater respect for internationally recognized worker rights.  Failure to allow unpaid, underpaid, and unemployed workers to peacefully express their grievances could lead to  greater explosion of worker unrest than there is already, Human Rights Watch warned.

At rallies, in interviews, and in speeches broadcast on national radio and television, several of the seven presidential candidates have spoken about the need to ensure the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, to end the state of emergency, address the fate of Algerians who have """"disappeared,"""" and improve the status of women within society. The present elections were called last September by incumbent President Liamine Zeroual, who announced he would step down before the end of his term. The first round of voting is scheduled for April 15. In the event that none of the candidates receives a majority of the votes cast, the two top vote-getters will face off in a second round two weeks later. The winner is expected to take office shortly after the contest is decided. The Constitution grants broad authority to the president, including the power to choose and to dismiss the prime minister (Art. 5). While the National Popular Assembly, the lower house of parliament, can force the prime minister's resignation (Art. 81), the president can dissolve that body and call new legislative elections (Art. 129). Political violence, sporadic before 1992, became endemic after Algeria's rulers interrupted parliamentary elections that year to prevent a victory by the Islamic Salvation Front (Front Islamique du Salut, FIS). Some 77,000 persons were killed between 1992 and 1998, according to estimates cited by the U.S. State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. In January 1998, the Algerian government, which rarely discloses aggregate casualty figures, stated that 26,536 civilians and security force members had been killed through the end of 1997. It did not provide a toll for members of armed groups, and has not, to our knowledge, provided any global figures since that time. The attention paid to human rights themes by the candidates engenders hope that the next government will take measures to remedy the patterns of grave human rights abuses. What follows is an update on some of the most pressing human rights issues facing Algeria, along with a series of recommendations to all parties. Political violence Civilian casualties have reportedly decreased markedly compared with previous years. They nevertheless remain at an appalling level. At least 250 persons were killed during March alone, according to government and media accounts. It remains exceedingly difficult to verify casualty figures and the circumstances of many violent incidents, due in large part to government censorship of security-related information and restrictions on journalists and other independent monitors. In their coverage of army clashes with armed groups, the Algerian media almost invariably report a number of """"terrorists"""" killed, but neither the press nor the government details the circumstances of the confrontation, the names of those killed, or indicates that any persons were captured alive or wounded. There is overwhelming evidence that armed groups that call themselves Islamist, especially the Armed Islamic Group (Groupe Islamique Armé, GIA), have killed thousands of individuals. Often the victims are chosen at random or for reasons that remain unknown. In many cases the victims' possessions are systematically plundered. There is evidence that some victims were targeted because they or their relatives allegedly refused to contribute money or provisions to armed groups, were suspected of informing on them, or merely because they were related to members of targeted groups, such as members of the security forces or armed self-defense organizations, or civil servants. Armed groups killed whole families, often abducting young women to be held in sexual slavery in guerrilla camps. In other instances, women have been singled out and killed for refusing to adhere to a dress code or for working as hairdressers or in other professions deemed """"un-Islamic."""" Although massacres in which hundreds died captured international attention during the second half of 1997, most civilian casualties—both then and more recently—occurred in smaller incidents, such as bomb explosions in markets and other public places, raids on families living in villages and farms, and assaults on cars and buses traveling Algerian roads. In 1999, much of the violence has been concentrated in the Mitidja region south of the capital and in a few other pockets of the country. For example, on the night of March 23 to March 24, an armed group attacked two families in an isolated farm in Hilouiya, between Blida and Boufarik, and slashed the throats of nine men, women and young children. Two young women were abducted by the assailants. One of the two managed to break away later that night and reach relatives, but the fate of the other is unknown, according to Cherifa Kheddar, president of Djezaïrouna (Our Algeria), a Blida-based advocacy group for victims of terrorism. The press has carried numerous reports this year of women being kidnaped by armed groups. On March 19, assailants set up a roadblock near ‘Ain Defla and kidnaped three women, according to the Associated Press. On March 11, El-Khabar daily reported, armed groups killed three members of a family in Khemis Miliana and abducted the mother. On February 12, Agence France-Presse cited Algerian press accounts of the discovery of the bodies of ten women abducted during the massacre that occurred in Tadjena, near Chlef, on the night of December 8. That massacre, the largest reported in recent months, claimed the lives of some forty-five men, women and children. According to Kheddar, the kidnaping of women by armed groups is systematic during their raids in rural areas. """"In some cases girls as young as twelve or thirteen years old are abducted. If the girl makes any problems, they just slash her throat on the spot,"""" she said. Kheddar gives a """"rough estimate"""" of some 10,000 persons abducted by armed groups since the start of the conflict. These abductions should be distinguished from """"disappearances,"""" the term commonly used to refer to cases in which government forces are believed to have taken the person into custody but do not acknowledge it. In most cases, the fate of the abducted person remains unknown. Organizations have documented scores of such incidents but none has assembled a systematic record of the phenomenon. Nor are there to our knowledge any official statistics on its occurrence. Mass graves. The agony of the families of abducted persons has been sharpened by the discovery during recent months of mass graves in abandoned wells in the rural Mitidja region. Algeria's private newspapers have given these discoveries prominent coverage, describing them as sites where armed groups active in the region buried their victims. The bodies were said to be those of persons executed for the most part in 1996 and earlier. The discovery of the mass graves is attributed to tips provided by ex-members of armed groups who have turned themselves in to the authorities. In an illustration of its disregard for the public's right to know, the government has said next to nothing about these mass graves and apparently made no effort to inform the public—or the relatives of the missing—about efforts to identify the bodies. Kheddar observed, """"The number of wells found to hold bodies in the Mitidja is somewhere under twenty now. But so far, not one family has been contacted about finding a body."""" Ali Merabet, who heads Sumoud, the Association of Families of Victims Abducted by Terrorists, also condemned the failure of the government and state television to disclose information about the grave sites, while allowing, as did Kheddar, that decomposition of the corpses made identification possible only through laboratory work. Merabet's brothers Merzag and Aziz have been missing since they were kidnaped in 1995 by an armed group near the family home in Sidi Moussa. He told Human Rights Watch on April 2 that a militant who had surrendered to authorities disclosed six months ago the exact location of a well, less than three kilometers from Sidi Moussa, where Merzag had been buried. Since then, he said, he has gotten no cooperation from authorities in his quest to have the well unsealed and the account verified.  The lack of state transparency raises troubling questions about the large graves that were reportedly found. On November 26, El-Watan daily asserted, """"at least 200 corpses of victims of the GIA are believed to buried in the two mass graves discovered [on November 25]"""" in the Meftah region twelve miles south of Algiers, a former GIA stronghold. The graves were said to contain the bodies of persons kidnaped from a number of surrounding areas during the course of several years. In December 1998, two weeks after the discovery, El-Watan reported that sixty-seven bodies had been found at the site so far; Liberté reported the number at 110. Then in February, Liberté said up to seventy bodies had been found in a well near Ouled Allel, some twelve miles from Algiers. The government denied later in February that any bodies had been found at the site. It seems odd that graves containing scores of bodies would go unnoticed for years despite their proximity to urban areas. If confirmed to be the work of the armed groups, these mass graves suggest a remarkable logistical ability on the part of these groups to transport and centralize their captives, and to execute and then bury them en masse while escaping detection. The circumstances of these killings can be confirmed only by a radical shift in the government's policies toward informing the public and by allowing independent verification of the findings. Troubling questions also linger about the large-scale massacres that took place between August 1997 and January 1998, primarily in the heavily militarized outskirts of Algiers. While Algerian officials and many of the survivors attributed these massacres to armed groups, concerns about the role of the security forces emerged from interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch outside of Algeria and by others on the ground with survivors, witnesses from neighboring communities, rescue workers, journalists, and former security personnel. According to various accounts, the attackers, numbering sometimes 200 or more, arrived, slaughtered their victims using gruesome means that took several hours, and then departed freely through the adjacent militarized areas, without any effort on the spot by the security forces to halt the assault or make arrests. At Rais, the death toll on the night of August 29, 1997 reportedly reached 335. The killings began when men wearing military uniforms arrived in two open-backed trucks, firing on men playing dominoes at the entrance to the community, according to accounts that survivors gave to a rescue worker who arrived shortly after the attackers withdrew. The attackers, who killed over 250 people at Bentalha on the night of September 23, 1997, were reportedly able to load spoils onto trucks before departing. The questions surrounding the large-scale massacres of 1997 and January 1998 have received no conclusive answers. No independent Algerian body has conducted a thorough inquiry and the government has allowed no international human rights organization or U.N. human rights rapporteur to investigate. An Algerian newspaper editor explained anonymously why journalists visiting massacre sites are unable to mount the kind of extensive investigation that would be required:         If you want to find out what's happening in Bentalha, you must send a journalist for a month and that's not technically possible. It's an area that's controlled by the militias and the army. You cannot access information. We have testimony that people who were brought [before journalists] weren't living there before....A journalist would have to go in anonymously. It's nearly impossible. Forced """"Disappearances"""" A grassroots, predominantly female movement of relatives of the """"disappeared"""" has managed to place the fate of their loved ones on the national agenda. The term """"disappearances"""" is distinguished from the abductions referred to above, in that evidence exists that points to the involvement of the Algerian security forces in the """"disappearance."""" The activists launched the National Association for the Families of the Disappeared in 1998, and have collected documentation on more than 3,000 cases. Some human rights lawyers claimed the actual number of """"disappearances"""" is much higher. Those speaking for the government did not contest the 3,000-plus figure, but denied security-force involvement in more than a small fraction of cases, discounting strong evidence to the contrary. The movement's first attempts to demonstrate publicly, in late 1997, were broken up by police. But with the assistance of human rights advocates and some political parties, the relatives have persevered and by their efforts emboldened others to come forward with details of additional cases. Beginning in 1998, coverage by Algeria's private newspapers of """"disappearances"""" increased markedly. The issue was raised by deputies of the National Popular Assembly, by foreign delegations visiting Algeria and by the official National Observatory of Human Rights (Observatoire national des droits de l'Homme, ONDH). The U.N. Secretary-General's information-gathering mission to Algeria in July-August 1998 devoted conspicuous attention to the issue. Three weeks after the U.N. panel departed, the Ministry of Interior announced that it would open bureaus in every province of the country to handle complaints about missing persons. It was the first time that the government had acknowledged, albeit indirectly, that the problem of """"disappearances"""" was wide-scale and implicated authorities in some manner. Half a year later, human rights advocates uniformly express disappointment with the results. While Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sellal was quoted in El-Watan of March 22 as saying that the bureaus were functioning across the country and had thus far provided 400 responses to 3,100 dossiers submitted, several advocates on behalf of the """"disappeared"""" asserted no family had received concrete, verifiable information in response to a complaint filed with the ministry's bureaus. These include Ms. Kouidri, the national secretary of the National Association of Families of the Disappeared, human rights lawyer Mahmoud Khelili and Ghechir Boudjemaa, president of the Algerian Human Rights League (Ligue Algérienne des droits de l'Homme, LADH), all of whom were interviewed by Human Rights Watch in late March. Mme Kouidri added that some of the bureaus were refusing even to accept new submissions from families. The Interior Ministry has meanwhile taken measures to hobble the activities of the """"disappeared"""" movement. In November 1998, it refused an application for legal status submitted by the National Association of Families of the Disappeared. The association remains an unlicensed entity and thus encounters difficulties in holding public meetings. Confronted with this obstacle, some of the activists created an """"S.O.S. Committee of Families of the Disappeared"""" under the auspices of the legally recognized Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (Ligue Algérienne de défense des droits de l'Homme, LADDH). The LADDH's president is lawyer Ali Yahia Abdennour. Three times since December police have used force in an effort to disperse the rallies that relatives of the """"disappeared"""" have been holding weekly in Algiers, most recently on March 31. However, most of the rallies, which take place near the headquarters of the ONDH, have been tolerated. Further confirmation of the large scale of """"disappearances"""" comes from the U.N. Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances. Its most recent report states that in 1998 it submitted 578 newly reported cases to the government of Algeria, in addition to the 153 cases recorded earlier. Despite these figures, the government had provided the Working Group with information on only ten cases during the year.   There is broad agreement among those who have monitored """"disappearances"""" that the bulk of missing persons were """"disappeared"""" between 1994 and 1996. The frequency has since declined sharply. Moustapha Bouchachi, an Algiers lawyer who follows the issue closely, told Human Rights Watch on March 29 that he has not learned of any person """"disappeared"""" during 1999. Activists note, however, that information sometimes arrives long after a person has """"disappeared."""" Although families say that their inquiries with officials about """"disappeared"""" persons have been fruitless, there are isolated reports of individuals returning to their families after years in secret detention. Such reports give hope to the families that are still waiting. Access for Foreign Observers, Organizations and Journalists Algeria continues to restrict entry to individuals and agencies whose objectives include monitoring human rights conditions. Admission of foreign journalists, nongovernmental organizations, and U.N. missions has been highly selective, and once admitted, these parties encounter government-imposed obstacles, in addition to security considerations, that impede their freedom on the ground. United Nations: Algeria continues to block visits requested by the U.N. mechanisms specialized in conducting rights investigations. Both the special Rapporteurs on Torture and on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions have sought to visit but Algiers has, for over one year and two years respectively, declined to set a date for their visits. While Algeria did welcome last July-August a panel of """"eminent persons"""" dispatched by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, that panel, by its own admission, had neither the mandate nor the means to conduct a human rights investigation. On March 31, addressing the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Derek Fatchett, the British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, expressed concern that the repeated denial of access by Algeria to Special Rapporteurs of the Commission was undermining the credibility of United Nations mechanisms. A statement to the Commission the same day by Wilhelm Hoynck on behalf of the European Union cautioned that the visit by the panel of """"eminent persons"""" is """"not a substitute for co-operation with the procedures and mechanisms of the United Nations in the field of human rights."""" The EU urged """"early visits of U.N. human rights mechanisms, particularly the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Torture and on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions."""" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): The ICRC has not had a program in Algeria (except for its work in connection with the Western Sahara conflict) since 1992, when it was halted after just one or two visits to detention camps, due to the government's failure to meet the conditions the ICRC insists upon: access to all detainees, private interviews with the detainees, and authorization to conduct repeat visits. Hopes for a resumption of ICRC visits to places of detention were rekindled by an announcement in March by the Geneva-based organization that it had received an invitation from the Algerian authorities to resume such visits. The ICRC said it intended to send representatives to Algeria after the elections in order to follow up on the invitation. It would be a significant and positive development if Algerian authorities were to enable the ICRC to conduct a sustained program of visits to places of detention. Such a program could provide a measure of protection to detainees and help to safeguard against placing persons in secret places of detention, a practice that has been widely assailed, including by the official National Observatory of Human Rights. Foreign Journalists: Visiting journalists cannot work in Algeria without a valid visa. The same journalist may be successful in one visa request, unsuccessful with the next. The same news organ may get one correspondent in but not another. Refusals are almost never accompanied by an official explanation; the applicant is simply told that the request is pending. During 1999, reporters who have not been able to get visas when they have requested them include correspondents for Le Monde, Libération and the Financial Times, three of the prominent dailies that follow Algeria closely. But many other journalists have been admitted recently, including correspondents for The New York Times and Le Quotidien de Paris who visited in March. Once inside Algeria, foreign journalists are restricted in their movements. The government assigns them armed body-guards, ostensibly for their protection, and generally refuses to withdraw them when journalists insist on it. Between 1993 and 1996 armed groups explicitly targeted journalists and foreigners. Fifty-seven Algerian journalists and one French correspondent were killed. More than 100 other foreigners were assassinated. A correspondent for a major international news organ who requested anonymity recalled that during his extensive travels inside Algeria over the past year, There was not one instance when I was able to get out of a hotel without a posse of armed police """"bodyguards"""", whose real purpose is less to protect...than to monitor and control. The government took extreme umbrage when I spent time with...lawyers working for human rights groups that have attempted to investigate the massacres and disappearances....When I did go to the sites of...massacres...I was accompanied by four Landcruisers filled with national gendarmerie...with the result that the survivors of those massacres were too frightened to offer more than the briefest and blandest accounts of what happened... International Human Rights Organizations: The major international human rights organizations that have attempted to cover abuses stemming from the violent conflict in Algeria have effectively been denied permission to conduct a mission to that country since the first half of 1997. Human Rights Watch has been formally requesting access since January 1998. The International Federation of Human Rights (Fédération Internationale des droits de l'Homme, FIDH) has a long-standing request, which it renewed in March. Amnesty International has not been authorized to conduct a mission since 1996, despite numerous démarches since then; the Paris-based Reporters sans Frontières also has a long-standing request for a mission. In October 1998, the Committee To Protect Journalists became the first international human rights organization to conduct a government-authorized mission to Algeria since 1997. While the visit by CPJ was a welcome development, the mandate of that organization dictated a focus on issues related to press freedom rather than issues relating to physical integrity, including security force involvement in extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" and torture. Those issues fall squarely within the mandate of Amnesty International, FIDH, and Human Rights Watch—groups that have not been allowed access. Election Observers: Government policies on admitting international election observers has fluctuated since 1995. The presidential election of November 1995 took place with a token presence of supportive observers from the Arab League, the U.N. and the Organization of African Unity. In June 1997, the U.N. coordinated efforts by more than 100 observers from some twenty countries. There were no foreign observers for the 1996 Constitutional referendum and October 1997 municipal elections, and it was these two votes that aroused the loudest charges among Algerians of government vote fraud and manipulation. To date, no foreign observers have been permitted for the current presidential elections. The Washington-based National Democratic Institute (NDI), which, under United Nations auspices, sent a thirteen-member mission to study election conditions before and during the 1997 legislative vote, requested permission on January 21, 1999 to monitor election conditions and the vote itself. But as of April 7, the organization had received no formal response. The NDI had received U.S. government funding for the project. Algerian officials have stated that the decision on having foreign observers depended on whether all the candidates formally requested it. To date, only some of the candidates have called for international monitoring. Recommendations to the present and future government of Algeria: Human Rights Watch urges the present and future government of Algeria to give priority to remedying the human rights crisis that Algerians have endured for much of this decade. Human Rights Watch urges the Algerian government to:   Conduct credible and transparent investigations into massacres and other arbitrary killings, and lift all restrictions on investigations into these events by independent parties except where absolutely required.   Respect the public's right to be informed about the traumatic events affecting public welfare and safety. Instead of suppressing news of security incidents, the government should strive to disclose information promptly and accurately. It should make a particular effort to provide information being sought by persons directly affected by violent incidents.   Release immediately and unconditionally all persons arbitrarily detained, and ensure compliance by the security forces with international standards for the prevention of """"disappearances,"""" including those contained in international agreements ratified by Algeria and those safeguards against """"disappearances"""" that are found in Algerian law.   Communicate to all military, intelligence and security forces, and judicial authorities that torture and the use of excessive force will not be tolerated, and that officials who order or condone such actions will be prosecuted and, if convicted, punished in accordance with the gravity of these crimes.   Reverse current policy by lifting all restrictions on access to the country by foreign journalists and nongovernmental organizations; and by allowing in the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Torture and Extrajudicial Executions, both of whom have requested visits.   Ensure that appropriate medical care, including psychological counseling, is provided to rape survivors, including those who have become pregnant as a result of rape.   Human Rights Watch also urges once again all armed groups to halt immediately deliberate attacks on civilians; to halt indiscriminate attacks that disregard the protection of civilians; to release immediately and unconditionally all civilians in their custody and to treat humanely anyone in their custody; and to cease all gender-based forms of abuse, especially the abduction, rape and sexual enslavement of women and girls.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria",""

Next week will mark the fifth anniversary of the genocide, in which more than half a million Tutsi and thousands of Hutu associated with them were killed. An internationally-recognized team of historians, political scientists, and lawyers spent four years conducting research and analysis of the genocide. The team was the first to have access to documents of the genocidal government, as well as to previously unpublished diplomatic and judicial records. Researchers also conducted hundreds of interviews with Rwandans—both local organizers of the genocide and those they targeted for extermination. The 800 page history contains dozens of maps and primary sources. """"The world has been saying for five years now that the Rwandan genocide was a terrible thing,"""" said Alison Des Forges, author of the study. """"But that's not enough. We need to know how such killing campaigns work, if we hope ever to prevent them."""" Many people outside Rwanda called the genocide a spontaneous outburst of ethnic violence on a massive scale. But this study makes clear how a relatively small group of determined killers planned the mass murder for months in advance and then enticed and intimidated others into following them. Other observers blamed the """"failed state."""" But this history shows how organizers took over a highly centralized government and used its efficient machinery to carry the killing campaign into every part of the country. The study recounts security meetings in which specific people were chosen for slaughter, the disposal of bodies was arranged, and the property of victims was divided. """"Our extraordinarily rich sources, both written and spoken, bring alive both the suffering of the victims and the motives of the killers,"""" said Des Forges, a consultant for Human Rights Watch and a historian specializing in the study of central Africa. The research team also interviewed foreign decision-makers and had access to confidential diplomatic accounts. It establishes that U.S., French, and Belgian authorities, as well as those at the United Nations, received dozens of warnings in the months before the genocide but failed to act effectively. Even worse, foreign leaders reacted timidly and tardily once the killing began. """"The Americans were interested in saving money, the Belgians were interested in saving face, and the French were interested in saving their ally, the genocidal government,"""" said Des Forges. """"All of that took priority over saving lives."""" Unwilling to call genocide by its name, foreign leaders treated the outlaw government as legitimate and even allowed it to remain a member of the U.N. Security Council. The killers used their """"legitimacy"""" abroad to buttress their authority at home and sought to cover the genocide with a cloak of legality. In a similar way, officials and ordinary people used the pretext of """"orders"""" from a supposedly legitimate government to hide from themselves and others the evil they were doing. The study shows that even people at local meetings, in areas far from the capital, discussed foreign reactions to the genocide. Protests from abroad, as hesitant and conditional as they were, did produce changes in tactics. """"If such small efforts could get results, imagine what a firmer stand, taken earlier, might have produced,"""" said Des Forges. """"International interventions must be prompt, strong, and smart. We hope this history will make us all smarter about how genocide works—and how to disrupt it more effectively.""""","Africa, Rwanda, Europe/Central Asia, Belgium, France, United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, United Nations"

Should Press Bulgaria On Weapons Sales","","03/31/1999","NATO and the European Union should press Bulgaria to stop transferring weapons to armed forces that are guilty of human rights abuse, Human Rights Watch said today.  In a report released today in Sofia, Human Rights Watch charged that Bulgaria has earned a reputation as an anything-goes weapons bazaar over the last decade. According to the report, Kalashnikov assault rifles, mortars, antitank mines, ammunition, explosives and other items are available for a price—no matter who the buyers are or how they might use the deadly wares.  Bulgaria's accession to NATO and the E.U. should be contingent on the country's adoption and implementation of strict arms trade controls, said Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York.  """"If Bulgaria is serious about getting into NATO and the European Union, it should put an end to arms sales to human rights violators,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. Case studies in the 53-page report indicate that Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, among others, all have recently received weapons from Bulgaria. All have been involved in armed conflicts during which serious abuses of human rights have taken place. The Bulgarian government elected in 1997 has pledged to comply with international arms trade control standards and improve regulatory controls. It has taken some important steps toward reform, including a promise to adhere to the nonbinding E.U. Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. But these changes have been insufficient because, as Hiltermann noted, Bulgaria has a legacy of arms dealing that is not easily shaken. The arms industry is a cornerstone of the post-cold war economy, providing tens of thousands of jobs and bringing in badly needed hard currency, and these factors discourage necessary reform. The Bulgarian government should not take its international commitments lightly,"""" said Hiltermann. He noted that weapons sales to Ethiopia and Uganda approved late last year contravene the E.U. Code of Conduct, to which Bulgaria says it subscribes. Bulgaria's arms business is characterized by weak policy guidelines, poor regulatory enforcement, and a lack of accountability. Bulgaria has failed to introduce human rights considerations into arms trade law; has failed to ensure that arms approved for export or transport out of Bulgaria are not  diverted to unauthorized end users; and has failed to prosecute anyone for violating arms trade laws. Widespread corruption hampers arms trade control efforts. In an example of a conflict of interest, several government officials with responsibility over arms trade controls simultaneously serve on the boards of state arms trading companies. Human Rights Watch is aware of only one recent case, in October 1998, when the government halted a suspicious arms transaction. The transaction involved the sale of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), apparently to an armed force in Africa that is under an international arms embargo. Human Rights Watch does not take a position against the production of arms, nor does it object in principle to the export or transport of weapons intended to meet legitimate defense needs. Rather, it holds that governments must ensure that they engage in the international arms trade responsibly.  This position takes on additional urgency in light of current NATO expansion. The alliance's move eastward is prompting aspiring members to upgrade their weapons to NATO standards. As a result, huge stocks of surplus weapons are expected to be dumped onto the open market, driving down prices and thereby making sophisticated weapons more affordable to the least disciplined and least accountable armed forces in areas of violent conflict around the world. The Human Rights Watch report made recommendations for significant change on five fronts. First, Bulgaria must improve its arms control policy to take into account the human rights impact of the country's arms trade. Second, it must address the weaknesses in its regulatory system, including corruption and a low capacity for monitoring. Third, it must undertake to hold responsible  those who engage in arms trade activities that violate Bulgarian law or Bulgaria's international commitments. Fourth, it must improve transparency with regard to the arms trade in order to enhance oversight. Finally, it must undertake to dispose of surplus weapons responsibly.  Human Rights Watch also believes that multilateral institutions such as NATO and the European Union should define arms trade norms for members, and make joining those organizations contingent on following such norms. Otherwise, these institutions will share responsibility for the use of these weapons by armed forces with a record of gross human rights abuse.","Europe/Central Asia, Bulgaria","Arms"

Human Rights Watch has received credible reports that a train carrying as many as 1,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to Macedonia was sent back to Kosovo by Macedonian authorities on March 30. Human Rights Watch researchers on the ground report long delays and obstacles for refugees crossing into Macedonia from Kosovo.  """"It is simply unconscionable to send refugees home when they are fleeing Yugoslav government atrocities in Kosovo,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"It is also a violation of Macedonia's obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention. Macedonia must keep its borders open to those fleeing Kosovo, and provide refugees with swift and safe asylum.""""  Under the 1951 Refugee Convention, Macedonia has an obligation not to return any refugee to a country where his or her life or freedom may be threatened (on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion). Kosovar Albanian refugees denied entry into Macedonia are at serious risk of persecution in Kosovo, and a failure to provide them refuge is a violation of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement.  The Macedonian government closed its border to all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from March 22 to March 23, before the NATO bombing began. Since then, 14,000 refugees from Kosovo have entered the country, bringing the total number of refugees in Macedonia to over 30,000.  Human Rights Watch recognizes the legitimate concerns of the Macedonian government about the de-stabilizing effect such large numbers of refugees could have on inter-ethnic relations within Macedonia. But such concerns do not justify closing the border to those fleeing persecution. Instead, Human Rights Watch called on the international community to provide the necessary financial aid and practical assistance to help the Macedonian government cope with this crisis.  """"If not handled properly, the refugee flow into Macedonia could tilt that country's fragile ethnic balance,"""" said Kenneth Roth.

""""But this will be too little, too late unless the U.S. puts some real diplomatic clout behind it."""" He called on Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Albright and other senior officials to lobby other governments at high levels, noting that both President Jiang Zemin and China's foreign minister were currently touring Europe, making trade deals and reinforcing economic links between Western Europe and China. """"No doubt China hopes that economic interests will again triumph over principle, and few governments will join the U.S. in Geneva. The Administration faces an uphill battle,"""" Jendrzejczyk said. When U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley visits Beijing next week with a delegation of twenty CEO's, Jendrzejczyk said, he should express his support for the effort to censure China at the Commission, making it clear that the Administration speaks with one voice.  The White House delayed a decision on sponsorship of a resolution until after the Commission convened on March 22; the Commission's current session ends on April 30. By waiting so long, the Administration squandered opportunities to gain the support of other key governments. On March 22, the European Union (EU) foreign ministers decided in Brussels not to support a country-specific resolution on China in Geneva. """"Had the U.S. made its decision sooner the results might have been different,"""" Jendrzejczyk said. Germany's president, Gerhard Schroeder, met with President Clinton at the White House on February 11, and China wasn't even on the agenda. (Germany is now in the presidency of the EU.) Over the last few months, the U.S. also neglected to use opportunities to lobby Japanese, Australian, and other government officials on behalf of action in Geneva.

If trials in Cambodia do take place, they must meet international standards,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Simply providing foreign advisers or pouring in funding support for the Cambodian judiciary is not the solution. Justice will not be served by a deeply flawed tribunal with the appearance of international legitimacy."""" As an example, Roth pointed to the failure of the Cambodian government in recent years to credibly investigate hundreds of severe human rights abuses even with the proffered assistance of the United Nations, the FBI, and foreign legal advisers.  """"Even with significant international participation, the Cambodian judiciary will remain highly vulnerable to political pressure and intimidation,"""" said Roth. A case in point is the 1998 trial in absentia of former First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh on arms smuggling charges. In that trial, conducted in Phnom Penh Military Court, a pre-determined verdict was speedily handed down, followed by a pre-arranged amnesty for Ranariddh. """"Any trials of Khmer Rouge leaders must meet international standards which Cambodia, through ratifying major human rights treaties, has accepted as its own,"""" said Roth. """"An internationally-organized tribunal would expose the evidence to the whole world, ensure the defendants receive the highest level of due process, and ensure that prosecutions do not selectively target only those Khmer Rouge leaders who fail to cooperate with Prime Minister Hun Sen.""""  A key distinction between an international trial and a Cambodian one is that the former would concern itself with human rights crimes, such as policies and atrocities that could constitute crimes against humanity. The law which Hun Sen currently proposes to use against Ta Mok, the 1994 Law Outlawing the Khmer Rouge, is a specialized treason/conspiracy statute for those who in any way further the Khmer Rouge cause.  Roth also expressed the concern that international aid for trials under this domestic treason law might be eventually used to legitimate prosecution of Hun Sen's current political opponents for reasons that have nothing to do with the atrocities perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge between 1975-1978.  Hun Sen said in a recent interview that """"Ta Mok will not go to jail alone"""" because he implicated unnamed others during his interrogation. """"Hun Sen's statement is worrisome, because he is not necessarily referring to other Khmer Rouge leaders such as Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea, but potentially to political rivals who have committed no crime,"""" said Roth. """"He can use this threat to stifle dissent.""""  """"Hun Sen credits himself with being the man who brought peace to Cambodia,"""" Roth said.

Serbs lack access to housing and social services, have problems obtaining citizenship and documentation, and face administrative roadblocks if they are refugees wishing to return. As a result, Serbs are departing every day from Eastern Slavonia, and only around 7,000 of the more than 300,000 Croatian Serb refugees living in Bosnia and Yugoslavia returned home in 1998. Most were elderly. """"Time is running out for Serbs in Croatia,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Right Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Unless Croatian authorities take urgent steps to ensure equal treatment inside the country, most Serb refugees will never return home. Leaving hundreds of thousands of refugees in limbo is a recipe for instability."""" The report, """"Second Class Citizens: The Serbs of Croatia,"""" describes how refugee and displaced Serbs often return to find their homes occupied by Bosnian Croat refugees. Authorities refuse to relocate these new residents even when other accommodation is available.

Long-term Serbs residents of Croatia who lack citizenship must pay a US$225 naturalization fee from which Croats, including recent immigrants, are exempt.

At the same time, the group criticized the Lords's ruling that Pinochet could not be pursued for crimes committed in Chile before Britain adopted the United Nations Torture Convention in 1988.  Brody, who attended all of the Law Lords' hearings on the issue, nevertheless questioned the Lords' decision to bar Pinochet's arrest and extradition for crimes committed before 1988. """"The Lords' ruling on retroactivity does not make sense as a matter of law or of public policy,"""" said Brody. """"Torture was firmly prohibited in international law, Chilean law, British law and Spanish law well before Pinochet took power, even before the Torture Convention was adopted. Certainly Pinochet knew that torture was a crime.""""  The group regretted that the case would now have to proceed in Britain with a narrower focus. Pinochet's worst crimes were committed during the period of state of siege between 1973 and 1978. According to Chile's official National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, torture was """"systematic but more selective"""" from 1978 until Pinochet stepped down in 1990. One case raised by the Crown prosecutors which would not be barred by the Lords' ruling is that of 17 year old student Marcos Quezada Yañez who, according to the Truth Commission, was killed by electric shock torture on June 24, 1989. The Spanish extradition request contains at least 28 cases of torture and executions which occurred after September 1988.  In their ruling, the Law Lords gave validity to the charges of conspiracy to commit torture. Although the Lords limited conspiracy to the years after 1988, their ruling should allow a full investigation into Gen. Pinochet's role in creating a secret police apparatus and implementing plans to torture and murder political opponents in Chile and abroad.  Brody noted that the Lords explicitly mentioned the discretionary powers of British Home Secretary Jack Straw in the Pinochet extradition. """"The ball is really in Jack Straw's court,"""" said Brody. """"The case of torture and conspiracy is still strong and there is no reason to reverse his earlier decision.""""  Human Rights Watch also suggested that despite the Lords' ruling, Spain could still try Pinochet for the full range of crimes for which he is accused. The European Convention on Extradition, to which both Britain and Spain are parties, limits a state to trying an accused for those crimes for which he was extradited, but expressly provides that the sending state can consent to a wider prosecution. Human Rights Watch called on the Spanish authorities to seek, and the British government to consent to, a broader Spanish prosecution, which the Lords' ruling would not preclude.  In light of the Lords' narrow ruling, Human Rights Watch called on the United States to seek the ex-dictator's extradition for the 1976 car-bombing by Pinochet's secret police which killed former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his American colleague Ronni Moffitt in Washington D.C. """"This clear act of terrorism on U.S. soil—a simple act of murder—wouldn't face the same legal obstacles the Lords found in applying the torture convention retroactively,"""" said Brody.  Human Rights Watch also called on the United States to turn over documents sought by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón on Pinochet's role in abuses. A recent Clinton administration directive asks U.S. government agencies to release documents by mid-May, but the Pentagon and C.I.A. are resisting. """"It has been three months since the U.S. announced that it would review its records, but not one document has been released,"""" said Brody.

On Monday afternoon, the newspaper and its editor-in-chief, Baton Haxhiu, were convicted by the municipal court in Prishtina for publishing information that """"incited hatred between nationalities,"""" according to article 67 of Serbia's controversial Law on Public Information. The paper was fined 420,000 dinars (US$26,800) and Haxhiu was fined 110,000 dinars (US$7,200). They have until Tuesday, March 23, to pay the fines, or the state may confiscate the paper's and Haxhiu's private property. Koha Ditore is the last Albanian-language daily newspaper publishing in Kosovo. Last week another major daily, Kosova Sot, and a smaller paper, Gazeta Shqiptare, were forced to shut down after being fined 1.6 million dinars (US$104,500) each. Another daily paper, Bujku, has not published regularly since January because the authorities have not provided a licence. According to today's Serbian press, also on March 21, the small Albanian weekly Kombi was fined 1.6 million dinars for an article it published on December 21, 1998. """"This is a death blow to the Albanian-language media,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"If Koha Ditore is silenced, Albanians in Kosovo will be denied printed information on the brutal campaign being waged against them by the government."""" The conviction of Koha Ditore and Haxhiu, after a closed two-hour trial this Sunday, was based on two articles published in the newspaper on March 19, 1999. One article was on the statement of the Kosovo Albanian delegation after they signed the Rambouillet Accord on March 18 in Paris. The offending section said: """"The decision for signing the interim agreement was not easy... Once again entire villages are being burned to the ground. Civilians are being killed, tortured and beaten. Once again thousands of people are being forced out of their homes."""" The other article was a statement by the head of the Albanian delegation, KLA political representative Hashim Thaci, in which Thaci labeled the government's attacks in Kosovo """"genocide"""" and called on Serbs to distance themselves from the policies of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Thaci's statement was taken directly from the Serbian-language new agency Beta, which was not charged with any criminal offense. The official Serbian television station, Radio Television Serbia, also broadcast parts of Thaci's comments. Serbia's Law on Public Information has been criticized by human rights groups and most western governments for falling short of international standards that safeguard a free press. Since its introduction in October 1998, dozens of independent and opposition newspapers -- in the Albanian and Serbian language -- have been ordered to pay disproportionately high fines because of their articles. The government has shut down five private radio and television stations, along with one Serbian-language newspaper, and two newspapers have been forced to move their operations to Montenegro.

Famine threatens to recur in 1999. The report charges that the government's abusive tactics, and the predatory practices of rebel forces and government-sponsored tribal militia, have turned this famine into a disaster requiring the largest emergency relief operation in the world in 1998, and the largest airlift operation since the Berlin airlift. The government spends about one million dollars a day on the war, roughly the same amount the international community spent on relief at the height of the famine. A cease-fire among the warring parties in the worst-hit famine area of the south, Bahr El Ghazal, has not been strictly enforced and will expire on April 15, 1999. """"If the cease-fire is not extended, the disaster of last year will be repeated in southern Sudan,"""" said Jemera Rone, author of the report and the Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch.

The 200-page report, """"Famine in Sudan, 1998: The Human Rights Causes,"""" urges the warring parties to end looting and attacks on civilians, as well as the diversion of civilian relief aid. It calls on the Sudan government and rebel authorities to punish those guilty of such abuses. And it asks that the international community actively support U.N. human rights monitors for Sudan, either inside the country or on its borders, who would be tasked to promptly inform the world of human rights abuses, especially those that might lead to another famine. Finally, the report calls on the government of Sudan to honor the promise it made to the U.N. Secretary-General in 1998, to provide humanitarian access to rebel areas of the Nuba Mountains which have been besieged for ten years by the government. Most of the famine victims were in the southern third of the country, where the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) is strongest. The southern Dinka population in Bahr El Ghazal, which is suspected of supporting the rebel cause, has been the worst hit by famine. For years, government counterinsurgency strategy has used army and tribal militia to attack civilians and displace or kill them, looting their cattle and grain, and burning their villages. Some women and children have been abducted for use as domestic slaves. """"The famine is over for the time being,"""" said Rone. """"But the 'hunger gap' between last year's slim harvest and this year's harvest could last from April to August, or even September. Without international assistance, many people will not make it through the 'gap' -- and if there is fighting again, and the tribal militias are not stopped from killing and looting, the situation will get even worse."""" Rone noted that the looting of tens of thousands of milk-producing cows in 1998 had made this year's """"hunger gap"""" even worse. A key turning point in the 1998 famine involved Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, a Dinka warlord who had been armed and supplied for years by the government to attack Dinka villages. Kerubino defected from the government side to the SPLA in January 1998, and tried and failed to capture Wau, the second largest town in the south, and two other government towns. Some 100,000 Dinka and Jur in those towns fled in fear of retaliation, heading straight into a rural area where some 250,000 people were already at risk of famine because of drought and continual raiding. Hundreds of civilians who did not flee Wau were massacred by government forces in the days following the fighting. Immediately after this exodus, the government placed a ban on all relief flights into Bahr El Ghazal that lasted practically two months, in an attempt to punish the civilian population. The population at risk of starvation climbed to one million. When the ban was finally lifted as a result of international pressure, and relief supplies began to arrive, the SPLA began diverting the relief food for its own soldiers, and local chiefs redistributed relief as well. This, plus continued raids and U.N. logistics problems, drove perhaps 90,000 civilians to government garrison towns in search of relief food; the death rate in those locations shot up. A cease-fire on July 15, 1998 (later extended to April 15, 1999) ended the famine-provoking raids for several months and brought better delivery of relief food. The death toll began to drop, although the food shortage is projected to continue until late 1999. Two factors make the future very uncertain: the re-defection of the mercurial Dinka warlord Kerubino from the SPLA and his negotiations with the government to resume his career as a government militia leader; and renewed raiding by tribal militias in early 1999, as the military supply train to Wau transported them and their horses into Bahr El Ghazal from the north. Another seriously stricken area was Western Upper Nile, belonging to the southern Nuer tribe. It suffered because two pro-government Nuer forces were fighting each other over political and military control of this territory, where a government-organized international consortium is drilling for oil to be piped north. The government directly armed both sides, one the ex-rebel forces with whom it signed a peace agreement in 1997, and the other the Nuer warlord Paulino Matiep, who undertook scorched earth campaigns, killing, burning, looting, and destroying Nuer villages and meager health and educational structures. As a result, some 150,000 civilians, most of them displaced by the fighting, were at risk, but the U.N. relief operation was unable to reach them because of the unstable military situation. Not coincidentally, the Dinka warlord Kerubino is related by marriage to the Nuer warlord Paulino, who is currently providing Kerubino with safe harbor. In the SPLA-held areas of the central Nuba Mountains, some 20,000 people at risk were not even included in the U.N.'s relief operations or statistics. The government's strategy in the mountains is to starve civilians into leaving the rebel areas, so it bans all U.N. access to them. Away from the eyes of the international community, the government's army and militia loot or destroy food, and capture civilians for internment in government """"peace camps,"""" where abuse and dismal conditions prevail despite international food relief flowing to the government side of the Nuba Mountains. In May 1998 the government promised the U.N. humanitarian access, but as of February 1999 this promise was not honored.","Africa, Sudan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/03/17/violence-and-indonesian-elections","Violence and the Indonesian Elections","Violence and the Indonesian Elections","","03/17/1999","Indonesia may be at a more dangerous crossroad now than at any time in the last thirty years. When I was there last month, it was exploding in violence from one end of the country to the other. A virtual civil war was taking place in Ambon, in eastern Indonesia, with Christian and Muslim neighbors hacking each other with machetes and burning down each other's neighborhoods. In Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, major military operations were taking place to hunt down suspected independence agitators, with villagers, as always, the major victims. In West Kalimantan, communal violence between two ethnic groups, Malays and Madurese, was set off when a passenger refused to pay his bus fare. In East Timor, the unexpected moves towards independence have triggered an upsurge of clashes between pro-independence forces and pro-Indonesia civilian militias, armed and equipped by the Indonesian army.  Unrest is erupting as villagers confront corrupt officials, debtors go after creditors, indigenous people clash with migrants, and farmers confront commercial plantation personnel. Some of it reflects power struggles at a local or national level. Some of it reflects nationalist aspirations that the Soeharto government tried to smother. Some of it is spontaneous, and some of it appears to be provoked, but provocation only works where the basic kindling is there to begin with. It is in this context that forty-eight parties, none with skilled or experienced leadership, have been approved to contest parliamentary elections in June. U.S. support for the electoral process is important, and it is critical that the elections take place on schedule, but it would be a huge mistake to see the elections as the key to solving Indonesia's problems. 1. The army The dominance of the army continues to be a major obstacle to a democratic transition. Too often the army is portrayed as the only force capable of holding Indonesia together. But from Aceh to Irian Jaya, it is the army and its past and present abuses that are pulling it apart. How many seats the military retains in the parliament or how long it will take to gradually eliminate the army's role in social and political affairs is not the key question. In the short run, the question is how to prevent the army from making existing problems worse. I can give you four examples. The army quite rightly identified widespread civil unrest as a serious security threat and one likely to intensify during the election campaign. Its solution, however, was to create a civilian militia, armed with the equivalent of nightsticks and given rudimentary training. The dangers of such a force should have been apparent last November when the army sought volunteers for a militia to protect the special session of the country's highest legislative body against threats from student protestors. Those who volunteered were overwhelmingly from conservative Muslim youth groups who saw any call for Habibie's ouster as tantamount to being anti-Islam. Militia members were almost by definition hostile toward the students, making a confrontation inevitable. For the elections, the civilian militia is to be called wanra, an acronym for """"People's Defense."""" In Aceh, an area that was the target of counterinsurgency operations from 1990-98 and where the army is loathed for its abusive practices, the wanra volunteers are reported to be largely composed of transmigrants, or immigrants from outside Aceh, who are already resented by the local populace. In East Timor, the wanra members are very clearly pro-integration and anti-independence. Putting them on the streets to safeguard the peace during elections is only inviting more trouble. A second problem is that the army tends to see all unrest through a counterinsurgency lens. The Indonesian army has no capacity to take on ordinary law and order functions. It was trained throughout the New Order to respond to internal security threats: the people as the enemy. In a situation of widespread civil unrest, this approach does not help. Sending soldiers to confront students in the streets of Jakarta last November proved to be a lethal error. Even when insurgents are in fact involved, the army's response is still disproportionate to the nature of the threat faced. In Aceh last December, seven soldiers were dragged off a bus and brutally murdered by people suspected of working with Aceh Merdeka or the Free Aceh Movement, a political organization with a small armed wing. The incident was not treated as a multiple murder and given to the police to prosecute. It was treated as an act of war and triggered the sending of thousands of fresh combat troops to the region, including from units that already had a reputation for brutality in Aceh. The new military operations in turn gave rise not only to new abuses, including the murder of five detainees, but to a growing demand for a referendum on Aceh's future political status. A third problem is that just at a time when Indonesia should be moving away from reliance on the military, some in the largely unchanged bureaucracy are advocating the expansion of a military presence. Officers are using mounting social unrest as a pretext for recommending the creation of new military area commands (KODAMs) in affected areas. Under the current military structure, there are ten KODAMs, each with about 700 personnel headed by a major general. In February, one new KODAM was approved for Aceh, and the violence in Maluku province has led to a demand for a new KODAM there. Just this week, officials in Nusa Tenggara Barat, the province that includes Bali, decided to request a new KODAM ostensibly as a preventive measure. The establishment of new KODAMs would not only mean a greater troop presence on the ground, but it would open up slots for officers seeking promotions at a time when available positions are shrinking, and the economic crisis has dried up opportunities in the private sector. A democratic Indonesia doesn't need more troops, it needs fewer. A fourth problem is the deep suspicion that some officers have of political reform, however much they may see it as inevitable. When I was in Ambon in February, the spokesman for the armed forces was asked why local troops made no move to stop an outbreak of violence between Christians and Muslims. He said that in the old days internal security agents, (Bakorstanas) would just have arrested people, but now it was the reform era, and they had to obey the rule of law. In this case, the army was using reform to justify inaction. In Aceh, the regional commander was questioned as to why his forces did not arrest an alleged insurgent leader in January whom the army held responsible for a series of violent raids. When troops surrounded his house, the man came out, surrounded by his family, and calmly walked away, leading many Acehnese to conclude that the army had no intention of arresting him in the first place. The commander said that before, the army would have just opened fire; now it had to be careful about shooting civilians. It's a good thing if soldiers feel constrained by legal norms, but both responses are disingenuous. They also imply that violence is a necessary consequence of reform, and that people might be safer with the old system back. Many in Indonesia believe that the worst violence in Indonesia in recent months, especially communal outbreaks involving Christians and Muslims, has been provoked by elements close to the Soeharto family, attempting to reassert their power. There is clear evidence of provocation in some cases, although none I know of that conclusively links it back to Soeharto. But when even General Wiranto is quoted repeatedly as saying that provocateurs were responsible for the Ambon violence and other incidents, one begins to wonder what evidence he has, why that evidence has not been made public, and why no provocateurs have been arrested. There is no question that the image of the army has been badly tarnished as more and more revelations emerge about its past and present, but in terms of U.S. policy, it is an opportunity for the administration to put all emphasis on strengthening civilian institutions. There should be no joint training exercises with Indonesian military units until the issue of provocation of major outbreaks of violence, such as the Jakarta riots in May 1998 and the civil war in Ambon, has been fully resolved, and any perpetrators punished. The U.S. should oppose the creation of any new KODAMs. It should support efforts, particularly in Aceh, to hold military officers accountable for past abuses, even when those same officers are currently holding senior positions in the government. It should continue to use every opportunity to oppose the civilian militia. And it should continue to support, as it has, the separation of the police from the armed forces, a move that is likely to take place in April. 2. East Timor I don't think any of us could have predicted at the last hearing on Indonesia how far East Timor would have moved toward independence. On the one hand, the progress is a tribute to the persistence of the East Timorese, the quality of their leadership, and the work of the United Nations. On the other, it indicates the depth of the pique Habibie and other top Indonesian officials felt that their offer of """"wide-ranging autonomy"""" last August was met with ingratitude and cynicism. One gets the impression now that they just want to get rid of the place as soon as possible. But Indonesia's policies over the last twenty-three years have caused unimaginable damage, particularly in dividing the population to the point that prolonged civil unrest, particularly in the western part of East Timor, is not out of the question. There are some old political wounds remaining from the civil war in East Timor in 1975, before the Indonesian invasion. But most of the potential violence can be traced to the Indonesian army's policy of creating paramilitary, pro-integration groups to help the armed forces in counterinsurgency operations. They were also used to terrorize pro-independence supporters, mount counterdemonstrations to pro-independence rallies, and engage in other political activities. Most were given arms and military training. In January, shortly after Habibie suggested that independence was a second option, many of these groups acquired new weapons. In recent weeks, pro-Indonesia militias, working together with local territorial troops, have attacked civilians suspected of supporting independence in Liquica, Ainaro, and Dili. Supporters of independence have also been responsible for violence. Any future East Timorese leadership will have to be able to guarantee the protection of the rights of all those who worked with the Indonesian administration. It will have to guarantee the rights of non-Timorese as well, many of whom came to East Timor as traders, teachers, or transmigrant farmers. The signs there are not good. In the last few weeks, almost 1,000 Indonesians have fled to West Timor, many of them families headed by teachers and civil servants who have faced harassment and intimidation since prospects for independence improved. Ethnic Chinese and ethnic Bugis, who dominate retail trading networks, have both been targets of attacks in the past and both need to be reassured of their safety. Now the question is how to avert major violence if, as is now planned, the U.N. conducts some kind of ballot to determine the preference of the East Timorese: independence or autonomy. Before that ballot can be conducted, the militias have to be disarmed, and some kind of security provided. The Indonesian army cannot provide that security; it is hardly perceived as impartial. It is therefore critical that the international community support, and press Indonesia to accept, some kind of international police presence that can also train East Timor's future police force. East Timor will also need massive assistance, given its current dependence on Indonesia for both budgetary support and for basic human resources. 3. Independence Elsewhere? The moves toward independence for East Timor have not gone unnoticed in other areas, although it would be a mistake to see East Timor as the domino that will cause other regions to break away. There are independence movements elsewhere, but they need to be understood as having their own dynamic, rooted in grievances which need to be addressed --and which will not necessarily be addressed by a free and fair election. Aceh and Irian Jaya are two provinces with well-developed pro-independence movements. On February 26, 100 political, tribal, and community leaders from Irian Jaya presented a statement to President Habibie expressing a desire for independence of the country they call West Papua. In Aceh, as noted, demands for a referendum have increased, first among student groups, now echoed by many political leaders. Both places are rich in natural resources but have seen little of that wealth reinvested at home. Both, because of the presence of armed rebels, became the focus of military operations that resulted in widespread human rights abuses and alienation of the local populace. In both places, failure to address the abuses of the past has resulted in greater support for independence from Indonesia. (When I was in Aceh in February, the deputy head of the local parliament stressed to me that the rising demands for a referendum and the ongoing violence both could be halted by one act: the prosecution of a single officer responsible for any of the killings and disappearances that took place in the early 1990s.) The violence in Ambon may push more of Ambon's Christians toward a separatist movement, even though support there for the largely expatriate political movement of the Republic of the South Moluccas has never been high. Muslims and Christians have been equally the perpetrators and victims of the violence there, but it is an area where the once-dominant Christians have become a slight minority through demographic change, and they need to be made to feel as though there is still a place for them in a Muslim majority country. Indonesia is not going to disintegrate overnight, but neither should the ferment in some of the outer islands be dismissed as inimical to the well-being of the nation. That ferment could in the long run produce a healthier political structure, perhaps based on a federal system as Amien Rais and the PAN party have advocated. The U.S. embassy, which by and large has done a terrific job on human rights issues throughout this crisis, should do more to get its embassy personnel out of Jakarta and off of Java. Congress could assist this process in allocating funds for the reopening of the U.S. consulate in Medan, North Sumatra. A Jakarta-centric myopia misses the point of much of what is happening in Indonesia today, from the causes of violence to the prospects for democracy. 4. The Ethnic Chinese Indonesia's Chinese remain traumatized by what happened to them in May 1998, when many were killed, some of their women were raped, and their homes and shops destroyed. The Indonesian government is about to ratify the Convention on Elimination of Racial Discrimination, but it has made few other efforts to ensure the Chinese that they are valued members of society. None of the discriminatory laws and regulations, such as those banning distribution of Chinese publications or celebration of Chinese New Year, have been repealed or revoked despite government promises to review them. None of the recommendations of the government-appointed joint fact-finding team that investigated the May violence has been implemented. Attacks on Chinese shops continue to be a regular feature of social unrest. The U.S. should continue to press the Indonesian government, publicly and privately, to investigate the origins of the May violence, if necessary offering FBI assistance the way it did following a grenade explosion in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 1995. In short, Indonesia has so many critical problems facing it at once that it would be a mistake for the U.S. to place too much emphasis on the elections as a way of getting the country back on track. Elections will help move Indonesia toward a more legitimate government, although many of the people I talked to regarded the June elections as a kind of dry run just to see how the process worked, with the meaningful poll taking place in 2004. The very low expectations about the upcoming elections is probably advantageous, because there is a lower risk of disillusionment. But regardless of the outcome, the role of the army, the ongoing violence, the issue of East Timor, the threat of disintegration, and the issue of the ethnic Chinese are all going to be around long after the votes are counted.","Asia, Indonesia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/03/16/indonesia-violence-ambon","Indonesia- The Violence in Ambon","Indonesia: The Violence in Ambon","","03/16/1999","In a new report on the communal violence that has wracked Ambon and surrounding islands for the last two months, Human Rights Watch calls on the Indonesian government to make public any hard evidence of provocation, investigate allegations of bias in the behavior of security forces called in to quell the violence, and acknowledge the terrible losses that both Christians and Muslims have suffered. It also calls on the government to examine and address the underlying communal tensions.  Whether or not the violence in Ambon was provoked, communal tensions there were explosive,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch and the report's author. """"This was never the paradise of interfaith harmony that has sometimes been portrayed."""" She said each eruption of violence that has taken place since January has added to the accumulated grievances of both sides, making any early resolution of the conflict much more difficult.  The thirty-page report, based in part on a visit to Ambon in February, presents differing accounts of the same incident from Christian and Muslim sources, showing the vast discrepancies between the two and the danger of relying only on one side. """"Neither community has a monopoly on truth or suffering,"""" said Jones. """"The death toll is appallingly high for both, and both sides have seen entire neighborhoods burned down, and houses of worship destroyed."""" The report notes that Christian sources as of March 9 were reporting eighty-three Christian deaths, and Muslim sources said over one hundred Muslims had been killed.  Some 30,000 people have been displaced and are living in temporary shelters in and around Ambon, not counting the tens of thousands of migrants, mostly from Sulawesi, who have left Ambon since January. As of early March, the government had not permitted international aid and humanitarian agencies regular access to the displaced.  The report examines four questions: Who started the violence? Why did it escalate so fast? What, if anything, could the government have done to halt it? And what should the government be doing now?  The Indonesian press, many senior officials in the Indonesian government and opposition, and many Jakarta-based diplomats believe the violence was provoked as part of a nationwide strategy of rogue military officers linked to the Soeharto family to disrupt the forthcoming parliamentary elections in June and create the conditions for a return to military rule. The June.elections, which promise to be Indonesia's freest Indonesia since 1955, would, if fairly conducted, almost certainly lead to a further diminution of the military's power, which has been on the wane since President Soeharto resigned in May 1998. In contrast, local leaders in Ambon tend to see the violence as locally instigated for narrow communal goals. In either case, the report says, government of Soeharto's successor, Habibie, seems to have been half-hearted about investigating allegations of provocation at either the national or local level.  Why did the violence spread so quickly? Ambon was portrayed in the Indonesian media as a land where relations between Christians and Muslims had always been harmonious, the tranquility of interfaith relations protected by an alliance system called pela, where for centuries, a village of one faith had been twinned with a village of the other, where Christians helped build mosques, and Muslims helped build churches. The reality was very different. Tension between the two communities, Ambonese Christians on the one hand, and Ambonese Muslims and Muslims from various migrant groups on the other, was so high that it would have taken very little provocation to ignite an explosion. Once the violence began, it quickly fed on itself, dragging out historical grievances, creating new injuries, and generating new, deeply felt communal suspicions.  What might the government have done differently? A key question revolves around the use of lethal force. The conflict in Ambon separates into two distinct phases, demarcated by a decision to fire on demonstrators. From January 19 to about February 14, most of the deaths on both sides were caused by traditional or homemade weapons — machetes, long knives, spears, arrows shot from slingshots, molotov cocktails, and fishing bombs (illegal devices exploded under water to capture large quantities of fish). Many people also burned to death when houses or vehicles were set on fire. From February 14 onwards, most of the deaths took place when security forces, whose numbers by March had risen to 5,000 on an island with a population of about 350,000, began implementing orders to fire on rioters. There is no question that an extremely grave security threat existed, and the security forces were initially accused by both sides of standing by and doing nothing as the different sides were attacking each other. When they finally did intervene, they shot bullets rather than attempting to use any methods of non-lethal crowd control.  A second question relates to the composition of the security forces used. Both sides have made allegations of bias, with the Muslims tending to accuse the police of favoring the Christians, and the Christians tending to accuse the army of siding with the Muslims. The accusations of bias were based in part on non-military attributes of the soldiers and police involved (geographic origin, religion, ethnicity) but also on their behavior in the field. Muslims accused Christian police in one case of opening fire near a mosque; Christians accused Muslim soldiers in another of helping Muslims attack a Christian village. Those accusations need to be thoroughly examined by an impartial body. Moreover, the government should deploy security forces with a view toward minimizing perceptions of bias, a point we elaborate on below.  The first two questions are directly related to the protection of human rights in a situation of civil strife. There is a third question of the government's response, however, which has arisen in other outbreaks of communal violence, such as a serious ethnic conflict that erupted in West Kalimantan in late 1996 and early 1997. This is the Indonesian government's belief in top-down conflict resolution: that if the local government brings religious or customary leaders together and has them sign a peace pact or participate in a traditional ceremony, the conflict can be solved. This approach can have unfortunate consequences, because when the pact inevitably breaks down, the participants often believe that the bad faith of one of the parties must have been responsible — and mutual distrust and suspicion grow deeper.  The report makes the following recommendations to the Indonesian government:  1. Ensure that its security forces respect the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officers and that troops assigned to Ambon are fully equipped with non-lethal methods of crowd control. Of particular importance to Ambon is the principle that """"Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. They may use force and firearms only if other means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result.""""  2. Investigate accusations of bias in the behavior of security forces. In many outbreaks of violence thus far, notably the shooting on March 1 of four people outside a mosque and the conflict on the island of Haruku on February 14, Muslims have accused Christian Ambonese police personnel of taking part in attacks against them. Likewise, the Christians have accused troop reinforcements sent from the Wirabuana command of the Indonesian army, based in Ujung Pandang, Sulawesi, of siding with Muslim villagers in several clashes. The fact that the Wirabuana command is led by a Muslim Ambonese, and that some of the Muslims involved in the conflict in Ambon are ethnic Bugis and native to the area around Ujung Pandang, does little to allay suspicions of bias. An impartial independent investigation, not necessarily of every outbreak of violence that has taken place, but at least of three or four major clashes where bias has been alleged, would be useful.  At the same time, independent investigators should work with local village heads (raja) and community leaders to examine reports that have been produced by both sides to identify points of convergence and divergence and use these findings to understand how perceptions have fed the conflict.  3. Avoid at all costs the imposition of a state of """"civil emergency"""" in Ambon and surrounding islands. This option is currently being weighed by Cabinet ministers in Jakarta and has been recommended by some local leaders in Ambon. With the very clear exacerbation of the situation caused by the presence of security forces with orders to fire on rioters, additional measures that allow the military to bypass normal civil rights safeguards are likely to make things even worse.  4. Make absolutely clear in all public pronouncements and interviews that both Christians and Muslims are victims. There has been a distressing tendency in both the Indonesian and international media to quote sources from only one side of the conflict. That reporting feeds back into the communal tensions in Ambon, helping fuel one side's anger against the other.  5. Find and prosecute any provocateurs. If General Wiranto and other senior government leaders have enough information to acknowledge, as they have, that provocateurs played a role in the initial outbreak of violence, they have an obligation to make public the nature of their evidence and make every effort to ensure that those individuals are found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  6. Ensure that international, non-religious-based humanitarian organizations are allowed full access to Ambon and surrounding islands to assist the wounded and displaced. The need is not so much for supplies of food and medicine but rather to find a way to distribute existing supplies safely and impartially.  7. Ensure that the rights of internally displaced people in Ambon are fully protected in accordance with """"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement"""" prepared by the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Her clients were arrested under emergency laws and held in specially designed holding centers, and were often interviewed without access to an attorney. One of a small number of solicitors brave enough to take up such sensitive cases, she was frequently the target of harassment, death threats and intimidation. Her life had been threatened by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) on a number of occasions, primarily via her clients. In his 1998 report, Param Cumaraswamy, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, paid special attention to these death threats and, in a televised interview, suggested that Ms. Nelson's life could be in particular danger. Cumaraswamy's report made numerous specific recommendations to the United Kingdom government concerning police threats against lawyers -- none of which, a year later, the government has implemented. At the time of Nelson's death, Cumaraswamy was in the process of updating his report to reflect recent developments. In September 1998, Ms. Nelson was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress, at the House International Relations Committee's investigation into the human rights situation in Northern Ireland. In her testimony, she explained she had received """"several death threats against myself and members of my family. I have also received threatening telephone calls and letters.

The court sentenced Al-`Attar to death for his involvement in a February 1, 1999 chase and shootout that resulted in the deaths of a Palestinian Preventative Security Service officer and two children. Two other defendants received life and fifteen years hard labor. Human Rights Watch urged that the defendants be retried before an appropriate judicial body which would meet fair trial standards, including the right of appeal. Human Rights Watch expressed concern that political considerations may have influenced the trial's outcome. Prior to the trial there had been several demonstrations calling for the execution of those involved in the killings. In the three executions already carried out, most recently on February 26, 1999, public demands for the defendants' execution appear to have influenced the verdict and the speed of the trial and sentencing. In those cases President Arafat's decision to ratify and implement the death penalty came within hours of the sentencing.  """"Even in the most heinous crimes defendants must be guaranteed a fair trial, especially when there is the possibility of a death sentence,"""" said Megally. """"The Palestinian Authority should not allow its courts to become an instrument of mob rule."""" Palestinian Authority courts have issued twenty-five death sentences since 1994. Most of the trials have been in military and state security courts that do not meet basic international fair trial standards. Trials are typically closed to the public, last only a few hours, and severely limit defendants' opportunities to prepare a defense and appeal a verdict.  """"President Arafat has said he is committed to incorporating international human rights standards into Palestinian law,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Abolishing the death penalty and the state security courts would be important steps in that direction.""""  Human Rights Watch also called for an independent investigation of the deaths of two youths `Ala Juma` al-Hams and Khamis Mahmud Salama, in Gaza yesterday.

He was escorted to his home, where he picked up a number of personal belongings and was then taken away by police. Nguyen Thanh Giang's current whereabouts are not known, and charges against him have not been made public.  Nguyen Thanh Giang's arrest is an assault on freedom of expression, and he should be immediately and unconditionally released,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The charge of 'possessing anti-socialist propaganda' means he could be convicted simply for possessing some of his own writings."""" She said that Vietnam had obligations to respect freedom of expression, belief and opinion under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its own Constitution.  Human Rights Watch has learned that Nguyen Thanh Giang may be sentenced for crimes against national security under the Criminal Code. It is possible that he will be charged under Article 82, """"the crime of anti-socialist propaganda,"""" which criminalizes the mere act of expressing a political opinion seen as injurious to the state or keeping or circulating material that does the same. If convicted under Article 82, Nguyen Thanh Giang could face three to twelve years in prison. A respected geologist and outspoken intellectual, Giang, sixty-three, has openly advocated human rights and multiparty democracy since 1989. In recent years he has issued a number of public letters calling for peaceful reforms. In his writings he has criticized """"red capitalists"""" within the Communist Party and denounced violations of human rights, while calling for """"real democracy in which people from both the top and the bottom would equally benefit.His writings include """"Human Rights, the Thousand Year Aspiration"""" (1996), """"Election and the National Assembly"""" (1997), and """"Let's Discuss the Vietnamese Workers Class"""" (1998).  Over the years Giang has been summoned for questioning by the police and criticized by his co-workers and neighbors. In addition, his family has been harassed, and restrictions have occasionally been placed on his travel. After attempting to run for National Assembly as an independent candidate in Hanoi in 1992, Giang came under more scrutiny from officials. In 1997 he was frequently interrogated by police and denounced as a traitor in meetings organized in the Hanoi neighborhood where he lives. In March 1998, police detained Giang for four days, charging that he was illegally distributing another dissident's poetry anthology. After he threatened to go on hunger strike he was released. In May 1998, Giang was summoned to the Cultural Police Headquarters, where he was advised to stop criticizing the party's polices.

On March 8, 1999, the owner of the daily newspaper Dnevni Telegraf, Slavko Curuvija, and two of the newspaper's journalists, Srdjan Jankovic and Zoran Lukovic, were each sentenced to five months in prison by the First Municipal Court in Belgrade for """"spreading false reports with an intention to endanger public order,"""" based on Article 218 of Serbian Penal Code. They are currently free on appeal. The charge stemmed from a December 5, 1998, article about the murder of a Belgrade doctor. The article said that, in the weeks preceding the murder, the doctor had accused his hospital's director, Milovan Bojic, who is also a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, of misusing hospital funds. The court ruled that the article suggested Bojic was involved in the doctor's death. Dnevni Telegraf had already been punished for the same article, in December 1998, when a misdemeanor judge ordered the publisher and editor-in-chief to pay fines to Bojic, who alleged his reputation was blackened.  Deputy Prime Minister Bojic belongs to the Yugoslav United Left (JUL), a party in Yugoslavia's ruling coalition run by Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. According to the journalists' defense lawyers, the public prosecutor, investigating judge and president of the court dealing with the case, are all members of the party. The current Minister of Justice in the Serbian government, Dragoljub Jankovic, is also a JUL member. """"The conviction of Curuvija, Jankovic and Lukovic is a graphic illustration of the increasing state repression against the media in Serbia,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The court's reasoning — clearly following a political order — is contrary to Serbian, Yugoslav and international laws that safeguard freedom of expression."""" This week's conviction was the most recent in a long series of attacks on the free press in Serbia. Since October 1998, when a restrictive Serbian Law on Public Information came into force, dozens of independent and opposition newspapers have been ordered to pay disproportionately high fines because of their writings. The government has shut down five private radio and television stations and one newspaper, and two newspapers have been forced to move their operations to Montenegro. Foreign broadcasts of the BBC, VOA, RFE/RL and Deutsche Welle are banned.

Impunity is prevalent in all phases of the legal process..."""" And this impunity, they said, is a basic impediment to sustainable development in Cambodia.   We agree. Human Rights Watch believes that U.S. policy towards the Royal Cambodian Government must be aimed at promoting fundamental human rights, ending official impunity, and building institutions to promote and protect the rule of law, and that the U.S. should use its substantial political and economic leverage to support the efforts of Cambodian citizens in these areas.   The U.S. and others should also continue to press for an independent tribunal, under United Nations auspices, to hold accountable senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge responsible for acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed from 1975-79. That tribunal should be held outside Cambodia.   The role of Cambodia's donors in promoting major human rights improvements is crucial. At the recent meeting of the Cambodia Consultative Group (CG), convened by the World Bank in Tokyo on February 25-26, Cambodia received pledges of some $470 million in response to an appeal by Prime Minister Hun Sen for a three-year package of $1.3 billion. However, aid commitments by bilateral donors and international financial institutions were conditioned on the government's implementation of political, economic and social reforms that it promised to undertake.   We welcome this development and urge the donors to strictly monitor the government's compliance with its commitments. Following the donor meeting, CG officials stated, """"The Government recognizes that the donor community is expecting actions, not words."""" And the government agreed to quarterly meetings with Phnom Penh-based donors to monitor implementation of the various reforms. This should be an open and transparent process, with regular reports circulated to the donors and made public -- both in Cambodia and internationally.   The Cambodian government, in a report prepared prior to the CG, vowed to uphold human rights, affirming its """"unbreakable attachment to liberal democracy, to the freedom of expression, to an independent judiciary, to neutrality and discipline in the armed forces and the national police, to the strengthening of the rule of law and compliance with national and international laws, to encouraging all strata of civil society to participate actively in the political, economic and social life of the country...""""   The question now is how vigorously will Hun Sen, Prince Ranariddh, and Cambodia's other elected leaders pursue these broad objectives in ways that will substantially improve the lives and welfare of Cambodia's people, while protecting them from abusive and corrupt official behavior?   Human Rights Watch continues to strongly support increased and unconditional assistance for humanitarian, human rights and democracy-building projects through non-governmental organizations. In considering the Administration's FY 2000 request for $20 million for Cambodia, we would urge Congress to explicitly target any U.S. bilateral assistance for these purposes and to continue channeling such aid through NGOs. Should the Cambodian Government make concrete, verifiable progress toward respecting basic human rights and ending official impunity over the next year (according, for example, to the steps outlined below), we believe the Administration should leave open the possibility of resuming direct non-humanitarian aid to the government at the next CG. But no such assistance should given without tangible results and the full agreement of Congress.   Japan, as Cambodia's top donor and host of the CG, pledged $100 million -- more than 20 percent of the total amount pledged -- and said it was considering restoring a bilateral yen loan program that has been suspended since 1974, depending on Cambodia's economic performance. But we are disappointed that the Japanese government focused mainly on restoring stability in Cambodia and did not link any of its aid to human rights improvements -- even though Japan's own guidelines for Official Development Assistance (ODA) require that human rights and democratization be considered in giving aid.   On the other hand, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura met with Hun Sen in Tokyo and told him that """"criminals responsible for genocide and other acts (by Khmer Rouge leaders) must be brought to justice,"""" according to foreign ministry sources. He also raised concern about abuses committed in connection with the July 1997 coup. This was a positive step.","Asia, Cambodia",""

We regard this refusal as a violation of the right to freedom of association, a right that Tunisia pledged to respect when it ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Conseil National, a nongovernmental association, was formed late last year by well-known and respected members of Tunisia's human rights community. The proclaimed goal of the Conseil was to monitor and promote human rights conditions. It formally applied for legal status and on February 26 received a receipt for its application.  We understand that the written refusal, signed by yourself and dated March 2, was received on March 6. The refusal provided no explanation other than to say that the application was in contradiction with the law. Unless it is reversed, this refusal will reinforce the impression that your government shows almost no tolerance for independent human rights activity by Tunisians. The refusal will be seen as consistent with the systematic efforts undertaken to marginalize and impede the work of the independent Tunisian Human Rights League, and to harass and persecute human rights lawyers such as Radhia Nasraoui, Nejib Hosni and others.

The letter urges the government to prevent political tensions accompanying the prosecution of Anwar from spilling over and improperly influencing academic personnel decisions.  The dismissal last week of Professor Muzaffar by administrators at University Malaya has been widely viewed both within Malaysia and abroad as a politically motivated reprisal against Muzaffar for his vocal support of Anwar and his criticism of the government's case against Anwar. In a letter to Malaysian education minister Dato' Abdul Razak, the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee calls for an expeditious and impartial investigation into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal. It also calls on education minister Razak to do everything in his power to keep partisan politics out of the universities and to press for reinstatement of Muzaffar unless there is compelling academic justification for the dismissal. """"At best, the circumstances are suspicious and demand an investigation,"""" said Human Rights Watch academic freedom specialist Joseph Saunders. """"A university cannot fulfill its paramount role in fostering free inquiry, rational discourse and open exchange of ideas where professors must live in fear of losing their livelihood for exercising their basic rights as citizens."""" The letter was signed on behalf of the committee by Jonathan F. Fanton, president of the New School University in New York and a co-chair of the committee. The committee membership includes internationally prominent academic leaders and scholars, including presidents of Harvard University, Columbia University and over a dozen other universities in the United States, and figures such as Lord Ralf Dahrendorf, formerly of St. Antony's College at Oxford and currently a governor at the London School of Economics, Krzysztof Michalski of the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, Ariel Dorfman of Duke University, John Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard University, and Fang Lizhi of the University of Arizona. A copy of the letter follows. March 2, 1999 His Excellency Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak Minister of Education Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Your Excellency: I am writing this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to express the committee's grave concern over the dismissal of Professor Chandra Muzaffar from the University Malaya. We urge that you immediately institute a fair and impartial investigation into the case and do everything in your power to ensure that political tensions in the country do not claim academic freedom as an additional victim. Until his dismissal, Professor Muzaffar was head of the Center for Civilizational Dialogue at the University Malaya. He was also a vocal supporter of embattled opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and, in December 1998, had joined Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail in founding the Social Justice Movement (Adil). Since the establishment of the Center for Civilizational Dialogue in 1997, Muzaffar had been employed by the university on one-year contracts, the most recent of which expired on February 28, 1999. Muzaffar claims that he had every reason to believe that his contract would be renewed until he received a letter from the registrar of the university, dated February 18, 1999, informing him of the dismissal. He received the letter on February 23, just five days before the dismissal took effect. The letter is reported to have set forth two reasons for the university's unexpected decision: economic factors and a government directive calling on the university to optimize existing human resources. According to published reports, however, the Center had showed considerable economic promise in its first year of operation.  At a minimum, the dismissal of Professor Muzaffar under these circumstances gives the appearance of a politically motivated reprisal for his support for Anwar and the reform movement. The appearance alone is damaging to the international reputation of the University Malaya and warrants action by your office. Until the matter is resolved, outside observers will be left with the impression that the Malaysian public university system is one in which important academic decisions are made according to political rather than academic criteria. To lift this cloud, we urge that you immediately launch an independent investigation of the dismissal of Professor Muzaffar. In the absence of compelling evidence of sound academic justification for the university's action, we further urge that you do everything lawfully within your power to overturn the decision and seek Muzaffar's reinstatement.

But it also questioned the sincerity of the United States in reaching its stated goal of signing the ban treaty by 2006. """"The goal of 2006 is already unconscionably distant,"""" said Stephen Goose, Program Director for the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But how can we believe the Pentagon is serious about that goal, if it's seeking nearly $50 million from Congress this year for a new mine system that will be banned by the treaty?"""" The new system, called RADAM, will package together existing antipersonnel and antitank mines and will cost in excess of $200 million. If the U.S. is signs the treaty, it will be unable to use RADAM after 2006, and will then have to spend money to destroy it. Last May the U.S. said it would sign the treaty by 2006, but only if the Pentagon's search for alternatives to mines was successful. """"RADAM is the latest of a growing number of indicators that the Pentagon is not serious about the 2006 deadline, and that it is very unlikely to be met,"""" said Mr. Goose. The world is moving rapidly toward a ban without the United States: 134 nations have signed the ban treaty (including all of NATO, except the U.S. and Turkey), and sixty-five nations have ratified. Ukraine, a nation with a stockpile of 10 million antipersonnel landmines -- nearly as many mines as in the U.S. stockpile -- signed the treaty last week. The landmines treaty has become binding international law more quickly than any major treaty in history. Global production is down significantly, global exports have been reduced to a trickle, more than 10 million antipersonnel mines have already been destroyed from stockpiles, and new use appears to be on the wane. There are still serious disappointments: the government of Angola -- a treaty signatory -- is once again laying mines, and very few nations from the Middle East and former Soviet Republics are willing to sign now. """"President Clinton needs to consider his legacy on the ban on antipersonnel landmines,"""" said Mary Wareham, senior advocate for the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. has used some encouraging rhetoric, and it has spent a good deal of effort on clearing existing mines. But the U.S. will continue to be a disappointment until it signs the treaty and fully embraces the ban. The Clinton Administration should do that this year."""" Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and serves as co-chair of the government task force of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines. Human Rights Watch is also coordinator of the Landmine Monitor initiative, a global network that reports on implementation of the treaty and on the humanitarian response to the global landmine crisis. The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty (also known as Ottawa Convention) comprehensively bans all antipersonnel mines, requires destruction of stockpiled mines within four years, requires destruction of mines already in the ground within ten years and urges extensive programs to assist the victims of landmines.","United States","Arms, Landmines"

His forthright statement ended Washington's denial of U.S. complicity in Guatemalan atrocities. But it's not enough just to feel Guatemala's pain. As new information comes out from Guatemala, illustrating with ever sharper detail the massive crimes committed by U.S.-backed forces, the need for a thorough accounting for U.S. policies becomes more urgent. An internal Guatemalan military document reporting on the status of """"disappearance"""" victims during the period that Washington resumed official military aid to Guatemala was released Thursday by human rights groups. The document is a chilling reminder of the cruelty inflicted by rulers Washington hailed as reformers. This inside account explaining the """"disappearance"""" of 183 Guatemalans strips the veneer of respectability the Reagan administration so eagerly sought to bestow on the military government of Gen. Humberto Mejía Víctores (1983-1986). It confirms what human rights groups have long alleged: that Guatemalan governments employed a policy of """"disappearances,"""" secret abductions followed by interrogation, torture, and in most cases, murder. ` Entries for most of the individuals include photos--often sliced from their ID cards-- as well as personal information, the date and circumstances of their abduction, and a final date, followed by the number 300. While the military may have been skilled at torture and murder, it was not sophisticated in the development of codes. The meaning of """"300"""" becomes apparent from its usage, as in the case of guerrilla suspect Edwin Rogelio Rivas Rivas. After agents shot and injured Rivas when he tried to elude capture, the document notes, they tried to save his life so as to interrogate him. However, """"it was impossible, he 300'd and it was necessary to leave him in the street."""" Another entry notes that guerrilla suspect Ruben Amilcar Farfan, on the point of being abducted, """"put up resistance and was 300'd."""" While most ended up as """"300"""", others were freed on the condition that they act as informers or were delivered to military bases to work as permanent snitches. Ten were turned over to """"D.I.,"""" the initials of the army's centralized intelligence agency, skilled in the use of extracting information by torture. Their ultimate fate is unknown. The document largely covers events of 1984, the year Washington renewed overt military training for the first time in seven years. This was the culmination of years of Reagan administration pressure on Congress to resume military aid, an effort launched during the military government of Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, now accused of genocide by a United Nations-sponsored truth commission. Reagan also succeeded in winning approval for the sale of jeeps and trucks to the Guatemalan army, speciously arguing these items did not constitute security assistance. The document released Thursday is the first internal document to come to light from the Guatemalan military. It is especially shocking when contrasted with the language used by the Reagan administration's State Department to portray the Guatemalan military at the time. Praising the Mejía Víctores government's """"increased sensitivity to human rights questions,"""" the administration's annual review of Guatemala's human rights record in 1984 concedes that """"sporadic abuse still does occur at the local command level."""" To the contrary, the newly released military document reveals a centralized bureaucracy of death, a powerful agency carrying out abductions, torture, and murder all over the country without interference. Why did Congress give in to Reagan administration pressure to aid such a brutal regime? One former congressman wrote recently that he fell for executive branch misrepresentations that it was the guerrillas, not the military, who were responsible for atrocities. Former Representative Mickey Edwards, who recently described himself as """"responsible for putting guns in the hands of the soldiers who committed those murders,"""" now regrets his acquiescence in Reagan's policy. He has called for a congressional investigation to """"assign responsibility and institute safeguards to ensure that no such moral lapse occurs in the future."""" His advice should be followed.","Americas, United States, Guatemala","Health"

Peru is an unfortunate location for such a gathering. No government in the region -- with the exception of Cuba -- has more seriously interfered with the independence of the judiciary. Your presence, however, will provide President Alberto Fujimori with undeserved prestige unless you take the opportunity to forcefully advocate the restoration of judicial independence there.     In Peru today, some three quarters of the country's judges and prosecutors serve on provisional status, lacking the fundamental independence that would protect the courts from governmental interference. In its 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released today, the State Department concluded """"...the judicial system is inefficient, often corrupt, and has appeared to be easily manipulated by the executive branch.""""     In addition, the Fujimori government has kneecapped those institutions created by Peru's 1993 Constitution to protect constitutional rights and judicial independence. The Constitutional Court has been sidelined by the removal of judges who ruled against Fujimori's interests; the National Council of Magistrates, the constitutional vehicle for judicial oversight charged with approving tenure for judges and prosecutors, has ceased to function after its members resigned en masse to protest executive branch interference; and the official human rights ombudsman's views have been consistently disregarded. So serious has the assault on judicial independence been that the World Bank in 1998 canceled a $22.5 million loan to assist with judicial reform.     Even after President Fujimori rewrote the constitutional rules regarding the judiciary in 1992, his government has continued to interfere with what little independence the courts still exercise. This interference has produced serious human rights violations, such as massive due process violations in criminal trials and the hounding of independent journalists, such as the naturalized Peruvian media broadcaster Baruch Ivcher, who has been stripped of his nationality and television station and tried in absentia in reprisal for investigative reporting.     For your information, we have attached a concise appraisal of serious human rights-related problems with Peru's judiciary.     We urge you to express to the highest levels of the Peruvian government the concern of the Clinton administration over governmental interference with judicial independence, intimidation and manipulation of judges, the persecution of independent journalists such as Baruch Ivcher, and the near-complete abandonment of due process rights in certain kinds of criminal trials in Peru.     Sincerely,     José Miguel Vivanco   Executive Director   Americas Division, Human Rights Watch     c.c.: Mr. Harold Koh, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   Amb. Peter Romero, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary   Mr. Eric Schwartz, Senior Director for Dem. H. R., & Humanitarian Affairs   Amb. Dennis Jett, United States Ambassador for Peru     Human Rights Problems with Peru's Judiciary   Erosion of judicial independence   Seven years ago, on April 5, 1992, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori closed down Peru's congress and courts, allowing them to resume operation only after their loyalty to his government had been all-but assured. The courts were massively purged of judges and prosecutors deemed insufficiently supportive of the government. The president now counts on a pliant congressional majority, made up in the main of the governing party Change 90 - New Majority (Cambio 90 - Nueva Mayoría, C90-NM), and a close relationship with key military leaders. Behind the scenes, he relies on a secret political intelligence apparatus, the National Intelligence Service (Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional, SIN) whose de facto head, Vladimiro Montesinos, is a close advisor. More than 70 percent of Peru's judges are provisional appointees without tenure. Appointment and dismissal of provisional judges are notoriously subject to political influence by the executive branch.     After its reconstitution, the new Congress rewrote Peru's Constitution to allow the president to run for a second term in office. Subsequently, Fujimori announced his intention to seek a third term in the year 2000. This aroused widespread opposition and was interpreted by many as a violation of the new Constitution. In May 1997 Fujimori's supporters in Congress impeached and dismissed three members of the Constitutional Court for finding a law enabling Fujimori to stand for a third term inapplicable under the Constitution. The court has been unable to carry out its constitutional functions since this congressional action. In November 1998 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the dismissal of the three judges, and pledged to submit their case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights if Peru does not reinstate them (See Organization of American States: Lima, Interamerican Commission on Human Rights, """"Press release no. 20/98,"""" November 13, 1998,).     Another key institution under governmental assault is the National Magistrates Council (Consejo Nacional de Magistrados, CNM), an autonomous body mandated under the 1993 Constitution to select and appoint judges and state prosecutors at all levels. The CNM's principle function is to foster a professional judiciary and protect the courts from political interference. It has powers to dismiss Supreme Court justices and prosecutors found to have committed infractions. Yet the Fujimori government has created a parallel agency, the Executive Commission of the Judiciary, headed by a government appointee and charged with the reorganization of the judiciary, which has increasingly taken over the CNM's functions.     Fujimori's efforts to influence judicial bodies are widely seen as an integral part of his re-election strategy. After political tampering with the membership and rules of the National Election Board, (Jurado Nacional de Elecciones, JNE), it ruled last August that a congressional vote was needed to authorize a referendum on the re-election issue, contradicting a previous ruling of the JNE before its composition and rules were changed. This maneuver allowed the Fujimori majority in Congress to kill the referendum initiative, frustrating in a stroke the efforts of citizens' groups that had collected the required 1.4 million signatures in support of the initiative.     In March 1998 all seven of the CNM's members resigned to protest a new law that gave the Executive Commission of the Judiciary sole authority to investigate complaints against Supreme Court justices and fire judges responsible for irregularities or abuse, powers reserved in the Constitution for the CNM. This law ensures that accusations against judges who enjoyed government support would not reach the independent CNM, but instead, be handled by the pro-Fujimori commission. The law was passed on the same day as the publication of a CNM ruling opening an investigation into the conduct of six justices who were alleged to have signed a forged ruling ordering the Central Reserve Bank to pay a $40 million compensation claim to a private corporation.     Meanwhile, the powers of the Attorney General, whose constitutional responsibilities are to """"safeguard the independence of the courts and the honest administration of justice,"""" have been sawn away by several laws vesting many of his functions in the president of the Executive Commission of the Public Ministry, also a close Fujimori ally.    Manipulation of the courts and intimidation of judges   Repeatedly, the government has altered the composition of courts to benefit its interests or those of political allies, while judges who have ruled against those interests have been sanctioned and intimidated. Judges who have granted habeas corpus petitions in favor of people illegally detained by the police or the army or seeking judicial protection against arbitrary government action have been specially vulnerable to these reprisals. In August 1997 judge Elba Greta Minaya Calle of the 37th Criminal Court in Lima was accused of obstruction of justice and terrorism for granting a habeas corpus petition that questioned the legality of the detention of a terrorist suspect. Civilian judges Sergio Salas Villalobos, Elizabeth Roxana MacRae Thays, and Juan Cancio Castillo Vásquez of the Lima Superior Courts Public Law Chamber, who had granted amparo petitions against military courts in several politically sensitive cases, were prosecuted by military authorities, removed from their posts in mid-1997, and later fined for negligence. The military justice authorities even tried to impeach Attorney General Miguel Aljovín Swayne for seeking to enforce these court rulings, openly defying his constitutional authority. (See Human Rights Watch, """"Torture and Political Persecution in Peru,"""" A Human Rights Watch/Americas Division Short Report, vol. 9, no. 4(B), December 1997 for a fuller description of these cases.)    The Ivcher case   Interference in the judiciary is best exemplified in the case of media proprietor Baruch Ivcher. Ivcher, who was born in Israel, was stripped of his acquired Peruvian nationality, deprived of his majority shareholding in Frecuencia Latina, the nation's leading television channel, and subsequently prosecuted -- together with members of his family -- on trumped-up tax evasion charges.     During 1997 Frecuencia Latina's Contrapunto program had broadcast evidence of serious human rights violations by the intelligence services, including torture by army intelligence and systematic wire-tapping of prominent government opponents. Within hours of transmission of the phone-tapping story, an Immigration and Naturalization Department official signed an order stripping Ivcher of the Peruvian citizenship he had acquired in 1984, evidently to provide a legal pretext for depriving him of his majority holding in the television channel, since ownership of a station is barred to non-Peruvians. Although Ivcher's 54 percent holding in the company was held jointly with his wife, whose Peruvian citizenship was not affected, the shares were """"temporarily"""" awarded to the minority shareholders who have close ties with the Fujimori government. The Supreme Council of Military Justice ordered Ivcher's arrest, ostensibly to force him to testify in an army investigation. Fearing for his safety, Ivcher fled Peru.     As the Ivcher family has struggled to recover his nationality and their shares in the company, they have faced a barrage of new bogus legal accusations. Ivcher has been convicted in absentia on customs charges, and orders for his arrest dispatched to Interpol. His wife and daughter have been declared fugitives from justice.     The persecution of Ivcher and his family has sparked widespread international condemnation. In December 1998 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur of the Organization of American States on Freedom of Expression, Santiago Cantón, both called on the Peruvian government to withdraw its request to Interpol for their capture and to cease persecuting them. In the United States, Sen. Jesse Helms, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chair of the House of Representatives International Relations Committee, expressed concern on June 17, 1998, in a letter to President Fujimori. Having received no response, they wrote him again in October. Also that month, Rep. Gilman introduced a motion to the House (Resolution 609) concluding that """"the erosion of the independence and the judicial branches of the Government of Peru and the blatant intimidation of journalists in Peru are matters of concern for the United States."""" In Lima, Ambassador Dennis Jett has made several forthright public statements on the case.     It is widely believed in Peru that Fujimori's adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, de facto head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) is behind this remorseless persecution of Ivcher and his family. Montesinos, who very rarely appears in public, has not rebutted these accusations. There is growing evidence that the SIN concocted these fraud charges and influenced the outcome of trials. The temporary status of most of Peru's judges makes them very vulnerable to this type of pressure and interference, which is all the more pernicious because it is hidden from the public.     The Ivcher affair is by no means isolated. Other prominent figures who have suffered similar legal harassment include Judge Delia Revoredo Marsano and her husband Jaime Mur. Justice Revoredo was one of the Constitutional Court judges dismissed in 1997, and later Dean of the Lima Bar Association. Following her election as dean, the association had requested that the National Magistrates Council investigate the conduct of several Supreme Court judges, one of the factors that apparently prompted the passage of the law limiting the CNM's disciplinary powers. Revoredo and her husband were also prosecuted and ordered arrested on customs charges for which they had previously been acquitted. After receiving death threats they left Peru in April 1998.    Judicial independence and due process in criminal trials   Although Peru's notorious """"faceless courts"""" have been practically dismantled, many of their worst features were reimposed for trials of members of violent crime gangs after the Congress briefly allowed Fujimori decree-making powers in early 1998. The measures introduced to combat violent crime restore some of the most abusive features of the defunct faceless courts, including the reliance on summary proceedings in military courts to try civilians. Organized crime suspects, including minors between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, are now tried by military courts and face a minimum 25-year prison sentence. For adults, life-imprisonment is mandatory. Habeas corpus writs against illegal arrest or ill-treatment under this law must be presented to military courts, giving no guarantee of a fair hearing. The protection of suspects from torture is seriously jeopardized by a separate decree that prevents courts from questioning police officers responsible for the interrogation. Implicit in this new system is the notion that those accused of serious crimes do not have the right to the same basic guarantees as the rest of the population and that convictions must be obtained regardless of the cost in terms of human rights.     Even while the Fujimori government refuses to allow judicial independence, your presence at the justice ministers' summit will provide authorities a golden opportunity to advertise United States approval for its handling of judicial affairs. It is vital that you-as the highest level political representative of United States law enforcement-correct that mistaken impression with clear public statements as well as private representations. To remain silent would inevitably promote the view that the Clinton Administration is a silent partner in the Fujimori government's suppression of one of the most vital elements of democracy: the independence of the judiciary.","Americas, United States, Peru, US Foreign Policy","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/02/24/indonesia-international-action-needed-ambon-violence","Indonesia- International Action Needed on Ambon Violence","Indonesia: International Action Needed on Ambon Violence","","02/24/1999","Human Rights Watch called for urgent international attention to the escalating communal conflict in and around Ambon in Indonesia's Moluccan islands.  The conflict has claimed more than one hundred lives since January 19, when a market brawl escalated into pitched battles between Christians and Muslims. Both sides have burned houses and vehicles and used machetes, spears, knives, and arrows in their attacks on each other. Those traditional weapons caused most of the casualties in the first weeks of the fighting, but deaths in recent days were the result of military opening fire on armed crowds.  The violence in Ambon has major implications for communal relations in Indonesia more generally, Human Rights Watch warned. Some national Muslim political parties see Ambon as evidence of Islam under siege by a Christian minority resentful of its declining influence. Many Indonesian Christians, meanwhile, see it as evidence of their increasingly precarious position in a Muslim majority state. The polarization is likely to affect campaigning for the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for June, channeling political debate into communal issues. """"The hostility between the two communities is such that each side is reluctant to acknowledge that there are dead, displaced, and detained on the other. In fact, the toll has been terrible for both, and there is an urgent need for assistance for both,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, who returned from Ambon last week.  Equally urgent, Jones said, is a security force perceived as neutral in the conflict and one that is equipped with non-lethal methods of crowd control. In the first weeks of the conflict, local police and army forces were criticized for failing to stop mobs on both sides from armed attacks or from dousing houses, markets, mosques, churches, and sometimes people with gasoline and setting them ablaze. Each side perceived the security forces' inaction as favoring the other. Now the army is firing on people, the death toll is mounting rapidly, and the same accusations of bias are being made.  There are also serious concerns about whether the soldiers are respecting basic principles on the use of lethal force, since they are using live bullets and appear to be unequipped to handle the kind of large-scale communal unrest they are facing.  Tensions between Muslims and Christians in Ambon have been building for years, but even in the past, Ambon was never the tranquil land of interreligious harmony that the Indonesian government has portrayed.  When Indonesia declared independence from the Dutch in 1945, many Christians in Ambon and surrounding islands identified more with the Netherlands than with the Indonesian nationalists. They mounted a short-lived separatist movement after independence called the Republic of the South Moluccas (RMS); several of the Muslim villages that have figured prominently in the recent conflict were razed by RMS forces in 1950, and the bitterness remains. In the recent fighting, Muslim leaders have accused the Christians of working with the RMS, thereby portraying them as both militarily organized and disloyal.  The influx into Ambon of devoutly Muslim migrants -- ethnic Bugis, Butonese, and Makassarese from the island of Sulawesi in particular -- also brought changes. These migrants now dominate local commerce and their arrival has tipped the demographic balance between Muslims and Christians in favor of the former. A traditional alliance mechanism between Muslims and Christians, called """"pela,"""" had no relevance to the migrants, and low-level fighting between Christian and Muslim migrant communities was commonplace. While Christians traditionally dominated the local civil service and police, this began to change in the mid-1990s when a Muslim Ambonese was named governor and began to fill vacancies with Muslim appointees, causing both resentment and fear on the Christian side. The situation grew perceptibly worse after incidents of church-burnings and attacks on mosques in Jakarta and West Timor in November. As Christmas and the Muslim fasting month approached in December, both communities in Ambon were on heightened alert for the possibility of communal provocation and developed communication networks to mobilize their people in case of trouble. When a fight broke out in mid-January between a Christian public transport driver and two Bugis youths, the networks went into action.  """"Whether the Ambon violence was provoked, as many have speculated,"""" said Jones, """"the much more important question now is how to stop the violence and help the victims, and for that, international attention is crucial."""" Particularly important, she said, was for the international and national media to reflect information from both Muslim and Christian sources; for international pressure to help ensure non-lethal forms of crowd control; and for assistance from international humanitarian agencies with the tens of thousands of displaced people.","Asia, Indonesia",""

The conflict has further eroded the rule of law in Congo, as military courts have been granted unrestricted powers over civilians. In January, a new decree on political parties actually consolidated preexisting restrictions on the activities of political parties, which are frequently attacked by the police. Government critics continue to be arbitrarily detained.  The rebels, supported by the Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian militaries, also have a record of serious abuse. Forces of the Congolese Rally for Democracy have on several occasions massacred hundreds of civilians, whom they accused of supporting local militias opposed to rebel control in eastern Congo. Many civic organizations are still active in those regions, but the rebels use arbitrary arrest, ill treatment in detention, and torture to frighten them into submission.

In its eight months in office, the government of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has released many political prisoners and relaxed some restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. But the 200-page Human Rights Watch report documents how Nigerian security forces are using brutal methods to suppress dissent in the Niger Delta.

""""The Nigerian government obviously has the primary responsibility to stop human rights abuse.

Roth noted that recent events in the Niger Delta, especially the crackdown on Ijaw communities over the New Year's weekend, indicate that the Nigerian government is continuing to use violence to protect the interests of international oil companies.  In one particularly serious incident on January 4, soldiers using a Chevron helicopter and Chevron boats attacked villagers in two small communities in Delta State, Opia and Ikenyan, killing at least four people and burning most of the villages to the ground. More than fifty people are still missing. Chevron has alleged to a committee of survivors of the attack that this was a """"counterattack"""" resulting from a confrontation between local youths and soldiers posted to a Chevron drilling rig. Community members deny that any such confrontation took place. In any event, the soldiers' response was clearly disproportionate and excessive.  """"Whoever wins this presidential election will have to cope with growing violence in the Niger Delta,"""" said Roth. """"The oil companies and the new government should commit to taking a new approach in the region, one that is based on zero tolerance for human rights abuse by the police and military.""""  Roth noted that the presidential campaign has included little serious debate over events in the Niger Delta and the role of the oil companies in human rights abuse there.  In the report, Human Rights Watch describes numerous other incidents in which the Nigerian security forces have beaten, detained, or even killed people who were involved in protests over oil company activities and individuals who have called for compensation for environmental damage. Victims include youths, women, children, and traditional leaders. In some cases, the abuse occurs after oil companies have requested that security forces intervene.  The report charges that multinational oil companies are complicit in abuses committed by the Nigerian military and police because they fail to condemn them publicly and to intervene with the Nigerian government to help ensure that they do not recur. In many cases, Human Rights Watch found that the oil companies had made no effort to learn what was done in their name by abusive local security forces seeking to keep oil flowing in the face of local objections.  Human Rights Watch strongly criticized the oil companies for excessive secrecy, and called upon them to make public their security agreements with state entities. It urged the companies to insist on screening all security staff assigned to protect company property, to investigate violent incidents, and to publish the results of those investigations. The companies were urged to take all necessary steps to ensure that their legitimate need to safeguard their facilities and personnel does not result in abuses against members of the communities where they operate.  Much of the protest against oil companies' activity in Nigeria has surrounded issues such as environmental pollution and corruption, which lie outside the mandate of Human Rights Watch. But the need to respect civil and political rights, such as freedom of expression and association, fall squarely within the international human rights treaties that Nigeria has signed, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa, pumping more than two million barrels a day. This oil is produced by multinational oil companies operating in joint ventures with the Nigerian government. The Dutch-British corporation Royal Dutch/Shell accounts for nearly half of this production and has faced the strongest criticism of its corporate behavior. Perhaps for that reason, Shell responded most fully to questions from Human Rights Watch about its policies and practices and about specific incidents of human rights abuses connected with its operations. The U.S.-based oil corporations Chevron and Mobil also answered some questions, while France's Elf Aquitaine and Italy's Agip provided almost no information at all. None of the oil companies responded to requests to provide details of security arrangements with the Nigerian government.","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

These abuses took place as a response to demonstrations held by Ijaw youths in Yenagoa, the capital of Bayelsa State, and Kaiama, a community an hour away by road.   On December 11, 1998, youths hold a meeting at Kaiama, Bayelsa State, form the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) and adopt a declaration, which stated that """"All land and natural resources (including mineral resources) within the Ijaw territory belong to Ijaw communities and are the basis for our survival."""" Accordingly, """"We demand the immediate withdrawal from Ijawland of all military forces of occupation and repression by the Nigerian state. Any oil company that employs the services of the armed forces of the Nigerian state to ‘protect' its operations will be viewed as an enemy of the Ijaw people."""" The youths advised """"all oil companies staff and contractors to withdraw from Ijaw territories by the 30th December 1998, pending the resolution of the issue of resource ownership and control in the Ijaw area of the Niger Delta.""""   In anticipation of the deadline, several thousand troops were moved into the Ijaw areas of Bayelsa and Delta states. On December 30, youths supporting the Kaiama Declaration demonstrated peacefully in Yenagoa and in other communities across the Ijaw areas of the delta. In Bomadi, Delta State, the military administrator attended the demonstration. In Yenagoa, however, a peaceful procession was met with force. Up to 2,000 youths holding candles and dressed in black met early in the morning and processed along the main street. According to eyewitnesses they were peaceful and unarmed. As they approached the entrance to government house, the base of the military administrator of Bayelsa State, Lt. Col. Paul Obi, soldiers posted at the gate fired on the demonstrators. Several were injured and, according to witnesses, one killed during the firing. Others were arrested and taken to the police station. Later in the day, at least three other youths were killed in a further confrontation with soldiers under the command of a Major Oputa.   The next day, youths who had heard of these killings marched towards Yenagoa from Kaiama and other nearby communities. There was a confrontation at Mbiama junction, where the road divides to lead to Yenagoa or Kaiama, and soldiers fired on the youths, killing several and injuring others. An army truck was set on fire on the bridge at Kaiama. One group of youths came past the junction into Yenagoa, and were met by soldiers again at the motor park, and again a number were killed and injured when soldiers fired without warning. Most of these youths were unarmed, but eyewitnesses reported that ten youths armed with rifles came right into Yenagoa and exchanged fire with soldiers, with no casualties; eventually the youths retreated. At least one person not involved in the confrontation was reportedly shot dead by soldiers at this time. Over the next few days, soldiers were stopping youths and checking them for marks indicating they supported """"Egbesu,"""" a traditional Ijaw god. Many were beaten severely at road blocks, some were killed. Others were detained.   In Yenagoa, to this day, tens of soldiers and mobile police posted to the small community are continuing to harass local people. In the """"black market"""" slum area, soldiers and mobile police are continuing to rape local women, dragging them from their shacks at night, and threatening them and their husbands with violence if they do not comply. Several tens remain in detention in Port Harcourt, Warri and Yenagoa to date: several of those injured in the shooting at government house are being kept under surveillance in hospital in Yenagoa.   During the confrontation along the road between Kaiama and Yenagoa, two soldiers were allegedly killed by youths. In retaliation, three truck loads of soldiers went to Kaiama on January 2, where they carried out reprisals for these deaths over the next few days. As the troops came into the village, most people fled, but some were found in their homes and beaten. Houses were ransacked and valuable property and money taken; others were set fire. Women were raped. At least two were shot dead as they tried to escape; others are missing and it is not known if they fled or were killed.   Sixty-seven people were eventually taken to the motor park, among them the traditional leader of the area, Chief Sergeant Afuniama, and several of his advisers, as well as the Anglican priest in Kaiama. These people were kept in the burning sun for three days, with no water for a large part of that time, and were severely and repeatedly beaten by the soldiers. Two of them had parts of their ears cut off with knives; many received matchet (machete) wounds to their heads, or were cut with broken bottles. Most appalling of all, Chief Afuniama was beaten to the point of unconsciousness, and was then killed, in full view of the others there, by soldiers who dropped a large rock on his head. His body was left in the open for most of the day, and was then taken away. It was found a day later floating in the water downstream from the village. At least nine other corpses were brought to the motor park and later taken away.   Eventually, on the third day that these people were held in the motorpark, the Military Administrator of Bayelsa State, Lt. Col. Obi, came to Kaiama, and ordered that most of them be released after giving their details to the commissioner of police, who accompanied him; twenty or more were taken to Yenagoa, where most of the rest were released, and some taken to hospital. Soldiers were withdrawn from Kaiama after about week, and the people who had fled gradually began to return to the community.   On January 4, 1999, Opia and Ikenyan, two small communities of maybe 500 people each in Delta State, Warri North local government area, were attacked by about 100 armed soldiers using boats and a helicopter owned by Chevron. Community members described to Human Rights Watch how a helicopter of the kind they are used to seeing flying on Chevron's operations flew low over the community: at first they thought nothing of it, since there are two Chevron wells within 100 metres of Opia village, but as the helicopter approached the village it started firing down at them. After staying about half an hour at Opia, the helicopter flew to nearby Ikenyan and did the same thing. A short while later soldiers came to first Opia and then Ikenyan in four boats. Three of these boats were """"sea trucks"""" of the type used by Chevron; the fourth was a military boat with a machine gun mounted on it. As the boats came towards the villages the soldiers started firing, killing at least two people in each place, including the traditional leader of Ikenyan who was approaching them to try to negotiate. Fifteen people from Opia and forty-seven from Ikenyan are still missing: the communities do not know if their bodies have been thrown in the river or taken away or if they have fled and not come back. The soldiers torched each village before they left, destroying virtually all the houses; canoes were sunk and other property destroyed.   In correspondence with a committee appointed by the two communities to take up their case, Chevron has stated that it was informed by the soldiers that the raid on the villages was a """"counter attack"""" by soldiers who had been threatened by youths as they guarded a Chevron drilling rig which Chevron staff had evacuated following the Kaiama Declaration. Chevron expressed no regret for what had happened, and no company representatives have visited the community since the events of January 4. Members of the community state, however, that they know of no such altercation, and have no idea why they were targeted. Chevron facilities in the area were evacuated in advance of the December 30 deadline set by the Kaiama Declaration and soldiers posted to guard them.   There have been other recent attacks by soldiers on communities in the delta area in recent weeks. Up to nineteen people were reportedly killed by soldiers based at Shell's Forcados terminal on the Atlantic coast. There has also been violence between communities close to Agip's Brass terminal, and many soldiers have been posted to the facility. Human Rights Watch has not, however, been able to investigate these incidents.   The following are two testimonies given to Human Rights Watch by eyewitnesses to these events.   Testimony of A, a man of 56, of Kaiama, Bayelsa State  I can only tell you what I saw with my own eyes. At about ten o'clock in the morning on January 2, I was visiting Chief Ajoko. While I was there I saw a crowd running towards us saying soldiers are coming. We turned to go into the next room of the house to decide what to do, and as we turned three soldiers came and called to us to come out. We went out, Chief Ajoko, myself, and two others, and the soldiers told us to lie on the ground. I was kicked in the hip. The soldiers went away and then came back and said we should move with them. As we went we met Milton Pens Arizia, Moses Ogori, Nairobi Finikumo, Chief Geigei and Aklis Ogbugu. We were all taken to the motor park. As we got there they sat us under the fruit tree. Others were just lying down in the gutter. Chief Ajoko was by me. A soldier just came and just used his knife to cut off the bottom of his ear. The soldier took it and told him he should eat it. He refused, and one other soldier told the first """"don't do that."""" They brought four corpses on a wheelbarrow. In the evening they took them away. They took us into the motor park, we were 67 when we went in. They put us in three groups and guarded us with soldiers till morning. There were more than 100 soldiers. They told us to take off our shirts. For some time they told us to look up at the sun when it was very high and they beat us if we closed our eyes. They took sand and sprayed it in our eyes. They said we should do some frog jumps. For some years I have had a problem with my right leg which does not bend properly. Up to today I now have pain in my leg because of the frog jumps. They said we should walk on our knees with our hands on our head. Then we had to lie on our back on top of broken bottles and creep along. They also had broken bottles and used them to cut us on our backs. Then they came with matchets [machetes] and told us to sit on the ground looking forward. They cut me on my head, which started bleeding - my clothes I was wearing that day are still stained with blood. They were beating us all the time for just anything. Chief Sergeant Afuniama, the traditional leader of Kaiama; T.K Owonaro, the deputy chief of Kaiama; Chief Tolumoye Ajoko, traditional leader of Olobiri; and Pereowei Presley Eguruze, the youth president of Kolokuma-Opokuma local government area, were taken outside for """"special treatment."""" When Chief Afuniama was brought back into the park he fell down unconscious. A soldier came and dropped a stone on his head. He released it twice, and he said """"The chief is sleeping."""" This was in the morning. They left his body until the evening and then took it out. About ten that evening, January 3, another group of soldiers came, and one of them said """"have these people taken water and food,"""" and he fetched water for us. Up to that time we had no water. Some were drinking their urine; about four were ready to give up had water not been given to them. The following morning the governor came, with the commissioner of police and the commissioner of health and education, and said we should be handed over to the police, who then took names and addresses, and then released us. The MilAd [Military Administrator] said nothing about compensation.  Testimony of B, a young man from Opia Community, Warri North Local Government Area, Delta State (translated from the local dialect of Ijaw)  On January 4, we were here in the village. At about 2-3 pm we saw a Chevron helicopter in blue and white colours flying by on the other side of the river, and then flying along the route of the pipeline. We thought it was on a Chevron operation because they normally fly that way. By the time it got to us it was flying very low, and then it started firing at us. We were surprised, we didn't know what to do, and we ran into the bush. After thirty minutes or so the helicopter was gone. Then some of the community members came back and were calling to the others to come back from the bush. We were gathered here on the river side and discussing what had happened when we saw Chevron boats coming towards us carrying soldiers. Three were Chevron sea trucks (two numbers were 221 and 242), the ones they normally use, and the other one was a military boat with a machine gun mounted on it. They were full of soldiers, maybe more than 100 in all. We ran into the bush again but as we were running they started firing, it was so intense I can't describe it, dugu-dugu-dugu-dugu-dugu. As I was running a bullet wounded me on my leg. When we went into the bush we saw a fire in the community, everything burning. Then we heard the boats leaving, so we came back carefully, crawling to see if it was safe and watching who was around. No one was there, so we called to the others in the bush to come back. We saw two people lying dead on the ground, Kekedu Lawuru, and Timi Okuru, a woman. We started crying, and called to the others to come. But some did not come back: 15 are missing till today. Maybe the bodies are in the river. About twenty were injured, of which ten or so were from bullet wounds, the rest from branches and stones as they ran into the bush. Almost all the houses were destroyed, burnt to the ground. All our property was destroyed. We had a boat that could carry 40-50 persons which was sunk in the river. All our canoes were destroyed. We have nothing now, no means of livelihood. Since then Chevron have not visited or come to their wells which are behind the village. Major Joseph Osadolo from Koko came and sympathised with us on January 6 - we learnt the soldiers who attacked came from the Mandagho military base by Chevron's operation at Escravos - and he promised the Military Administrator would come to see what had happened. We were told he would come on January 16, and we all gathered here from the communities where we are refugees, but he only went to the local government headquarters at Koko and did not come here. Up to now nobody has come.","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

Karl LaGrand is scheduled to be executed tomorrow, February 24. His brother's execution is set to follow on March 3, one week later.   We are particulary concerned by reports that these men, both German nationals, were not notified of their right to contact their consulate following their arrest. Consular notification is a right demanded by the United States in order to protect its citizens abroad and is stipulated in the Vienna Convention to which the United States is a party. The Supreme Court recently stayed the execution of another foreign national, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced her concern that the protections afforded defendants under the Vienna Convention were not being adequately respected. Last year, a United Nations Special Rapporteur cited the discriminatory and arbitrary nature of the death penalty's application in the United States and the United States' failure to comply with international standards governing the death penalty's use. This echoes the April 1997 call from the American Bar Association for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, claiming it is administered """"through a haphazard maze of unfair practices."""" Human Rights Watch is the largest U.S.-based international human rights organization. We oppose capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. We believe that executions are often carried out in an arbitrary manner, inflicted primarily on the most vulnerable—the poor, minorities, and mentally ill or retarded persons. The intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even full due process of law is respected, innocent persons are sometimes executed. Therefore, we oppose all executions under law whenever and wherever carried out, irrespective of the crime and the legal process leading to their implementation.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/02/18/donors-should-hold-cambodia-its-human-rights-commitments","Donors Should Hold Cambodia to Its Human Rights Commitments","Donors Should Hold Cambodia to Its Human Rights Commitments","","02/18/1999","As Cambodia's international donors prepared to meet in Tokyo on February 25-26 for the first time since the July 1997 coup, Human Rights Watch called on participants to attach human rights conditions to any pledges of non-humanitarian aid to the Cambodian government. Prime Minister Hun Sen will be attending the donor meeting, convened by the World Bank, at Japan's invitation. """"This is a key moment to press for an end to impunity in Cambodia,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The international community should insist on accountability for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge committed from 1975-79, as well as for dozens of extrajudicial killings, incidents of torture, and other serious abuses committed in recent years. Impunity will continue to plague Cambodia until the government takes effective steps to bring violators of basic human rights to justice. It is pointless to talk about the rule of law as long as impunity is not seriously addressed."""" Prior to the meeting of the Cambodia Consultative Group (CG), the Royal Cambodian Government announced an extensive reform package, vowing to uphold human rights. In the government's report for the meeting, it pledged to reaffirm its """"unbreakable attachment to liberal democracy, to the freedom of expression, to an independent judiciary, to neutrality and discipline in the armed forces and national police, to the strengthening of the rule of law and compliance with national and international laws, to encouraging all strata of civil society to participate actively in the political, economic and social life of the country..."""" The government also vowed to cancel several major logging concessions, reduce the size of the military and police force, and re-direct funds to health and education programs. To ensure that these promises are fulfilled, Human Rights Watch urged CG participants to condition any direct assistance to the Cambodian government on its progress in ending official impunity, bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to justice, and respecting basic human rights. Human Rights Watch continues to strongly favor unconditional and increased assistance for humanitarian, human rights, and democracy-building projects through non-governmental organizations (NGOs). """"Donors should tell Hun Sen they will closely monitor Cambodia's progress in taking concrete action to uphold fundamental human rights,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Human Rights Watch calls on donors to establish a committee to oversee implementation and report back on a semi-annual basis. Steps should be taken to address official impunity and lack of judicial independence, restrictions on the freedoms of assembly, expression, and association; violations of land rights, as well as guarantee that commune-level elections held later this year do not repeat the shortcomings of the 1998 election process. Background: Despite pledges the Royal Cambodian Government made in advance of donor meetings over the last three years, virtually no progress has been made toward ending impunity for rights violators. Officials linked to murders and """"disappearances"""" remain in office, and Khmer Rouge leaders associated with the 1975-79 massacres of more than a million Cambodians have been granted amnesty or allowed to move freely about the countryside. Among the most serious incidents of political violence and human rights violations that have taken place since 1993 include: Killings of at least two people by government security forces or their agents, and at least eleven known disappearances of other people in conjunction with demonstrations in Phnom Penh in September 1998. Another twenty-four killings -- mostly violent deaths --were reported in August and September, as part of an increase in killings that coincided with the government's crackdown on the demonstrations, although to date no causal relationship has been established. Dozens more protesters, including monks, women, and students, were beaten or injured by gunfire from government security forces. Murders of at least twenty-two people, in which political motivations played a part, in the final two months preceding the July 1998 elections. Extra-judicial executions, disappearances, and torture of close to one hundred opposition members and senior officials of the Funcinpec party in the ten months following the July 1997 coup. A grenade attack against a demonstration led by opposition politician Sam Rainsy at the National Assembly on March 30, 1997, in which at least sixteen people were killed and more than one hundred wounded. Murders of at least five journalists, the attempted murders of at least three other journalists, and violent attacks on several opposition newspaper offices over the last four years. Grenade attacks against gatherings of Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party members in September 1995, which killed two and injured more than thirty persons. Aside from these relatively high-profile, politically-motivated cases of impunity, hundreds of human rights perpetrators in the provinces have not been held accountable for their crimes. Despite requests from the United Nations, donor governments, members of the Cambodian National Assembly, and Cambodian human rights organizations, to date the government has not launched thorough or independent investigations into most of these abuses, nor have many of the perpetrators been put on trial and punished. The problem of impunity is compounded by the absence of judicial independence, as well as poorly-trained and low-paid judicial staff, lack of resources, and fear of judges to prosecute military, police, gendarmerie, or any other armed and powerful offenders. Key institutions such as the Supreme Council of Magistracy, mandated to oversee the independence of the judiciary, and the Constitutional Council, established to ensure that all laws passed by the National Assembly are in accordance with the Constitution, are clearly partisan and have little credibility. The majority of their members are affiliated with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen. In December 1998, freedom of association--particularly for human rights organizations--suffered a serious setback with the arrests and one-month detention of two human rights workers from the human rights organization Licadho after monitoring a demonstration, and the unpunished killing of an activist member of Adhoc, another human rights organization, in conjunction with his work. In 1998, several Cambodian rights workers were physically attacked in the course of performing their activities. In addition, a proposed new law on NGOs and Associations, if passed by the National Assembly, could further undermine the ability of NGOs to operate. The draft law would increase and complicate registration requirements for both national and local NGOs, prohibit associations from receiving foreign assistance, and enable NGOs to be more easily dissolved by the Ministry of Interior. Freedom of assembly and expression has been seriously eroded since the 1998 elections, with the killings and disappearances of peaceful demonstrators during protests against the election results in September 1998. Riot police used electric batons, fire hoses, rifle butts, and bullets to disperse protesters around the city and bulldozers were brought in to destroy a tent city that had been erected in front of the National Assembly. Freedom of assembly was also dealt a blow by the threat of arrest and ongoing court action against Kem Sokha, former chairman of the National Assembly's Human Rights Commission, for his involvement in the post-election demonstrations. The pending court action against Sokha not only discourages others from joining demonstrations, but also effectively silences a leading human rights advocate. Cambodia's donors could have a significant impact at the meeting in Tokyo given the Cambodian government's dependence on foreign assistance for approximately sixty percent of its budget. Japan's role, as Cambodia's largest bilateral donor, is particularly important, as is the European Union's since the EU provided much of the financial assistance for the July 1998 elections. The World Bank is committed to promoting """"good governance"""" including the rule of law and an end to corruption in all borrowing countries, but the Bank has thus far not indicated any willingness to condition its direct assistance to the Cambodian government on specific reforms except in the area of illegal logging.  Recommendations: Human Rights Watch urges donors to call on the Cambodian government to implement the following measures: Insist that the Cambodian government address the ongoing and unresolved cases of impunity. Press the Cambodian courts to prosecute those responsible for dozens of extrajudicial killings, torture and other serious abuses committed before and after the 1997 coup and in the months before and after the 1998 elections. Provide training and financial support for the development of a non-partisan and independent judiciary. Call for the repeal of Article 51 of the Civil Servants Act, which provides that civil servants cannot be arrested or prosecuted for any crime unless their governmental department agrees in advance. This means that soldiers and police officers who commit human rights violations are effectively immune from prosecution. Cooperate in good faith with the efforts of Thomas Hammarberg, the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Human Rights, and the Commission of Experts appointed by the United Nations, to establish as quickly as possible an independent tribunal to put members of the Khmer Rouge responsible for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity or other grave human rights violations on trial as expeditiously as possible. The Commission of Experts' report is due to be delivered to the UN in the next few weeks. Speak up in defense of Cambodia's domestic human rights monitors, who face ongoing harassment and threats of arrest or violence for exposing abuses by the military and police, and provide funding for Cambodian non-governmental monitoring groups. Their efforts are crucial to help prevent future crimes against the Cambodian people, and to build institutions that promote accountability and the rule of law. Call for arrest and prosecution of the murderer of an activist member from the human rights organization Adhoc in December 1998, and the immediate dismissal of the court case against two rights workers from the Cambodian human rights organization, Licadho, also in December 1998. The case against the Licadho workers clearly has no evidentiary basis and appears to be aimed at intimidating the local NGO community. This is a very worrying sign from a new government that claims to support freedom of association. Urge the government to ensure that NGOs and associations have the legal right to continue operating through passage of legislation, created with the input of NGOs and other members of civil society, which does not create undue government restrictions or interference with the activities of NGOs and associations. Provide funding for local human rights organizations, not only to facilitate their activities but also to demonstrate international support for the work of local NGOs, thereby providing an increased measure of safety for Cambodian human rights workers. Continue to support the work of the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Set specific and enforceable conditions on aid for the upcoming commune elections, currently scheduled for late 1999, before providing financial assistance, in order to ensure the elections meet international standards and do not repeat the serious errors of last year's National Assembly elections. This will help ensure more equitable access to the media, a neutral and non-partisan national election commission, an adequate number of trained international and local observers, and a less violent political campaign. Address the growing issue of landlessness, evictions, and forced confiscation of land by military and civilian authorities. Any new Land Law should be drafted with sufficient input from members of civil society and ensure title for long-term residents and the right to communal ownership of land among indigenous groups.","Asia, Cambodia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/02/17/shut-down-military-courts-pakistan-hailed","Shut-Down of Military Courts in Pakistan Hailed","Shut-Down of Military Courts in Pakistan Hailed","But Transfer of Cases to Anti-Terrorism Courts Sharply Condemned","02/17/1999","Human Rights Watch today welcomed the decision by Pakistan's Supreme Court to declare military courts illegal, but cautioned against the transfer of cases from the military courts to special anti-terrorism courts. The organization called on Pakistan's parliament to repeal the earlier Anti-Terrorism Act and the courts established under that act. """"The anti-terrorism courts sacrifice due process in the interest of speedy trials,"""" said Vikram Parekh, a researcher tracking Pakistan at Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring group based in New York. """"In this respect, they differ little from the military courts."""" The Supreme Court yesterday ordered that cases tried by or pending before military courts be transferred to anti-terrorism courts. Parekh also noted that children under the age of 18 faced capital punishment under the military courts, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Pakistan has ratified.  BACKGROUND: On January 30, Pakistan's federal government amended the Pakistan Armed Forces (Acting in Aid of the Civil Power) Ordinance 1998, providing for the establishment of military courts throughout Pakistan. The ordinance, issued by President Rafiq Tarar, amended Section One of the Ordinance, under which military courts were set up in the province of Sindh, where government forces have been engaged in an effort to suppress an armed opposition group. The decision to expand the ordinance to the whole of Pakistan was made following a series of violent incidents in Punjab province. In its decision yesterday, the Supreme Court declared only that the courts were illegally constituted but did not strike down the ordinance itself. The ordinance grants military courts jurisdiction over a range of crimes defined by the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as cases involving """"civil commotion,"""" an offense that includes creating """"internal disturbances in violation of law or intended to violate law""""; engaging in illegal strikes; and """"distributing, publishing, or pasting of a handbill or making graffiti or wall-chalking intended to create unrest or fear or create a threat to the security of law and order or to incite the commission of an offense."""" Human Rights Watch believes that this law violates fundamental rights of free expression and assembly.  The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997, which provides for the establishment of anti-terrorism courts, closely resembles the ordinance. Both laws provide for expedited court proceedings -- seven days under the Anti-Terrorism Act and three days under the Ordinance. Both laws also create special appeals courts with exclusive appellate jurisdiction. The Anti-Terrorism Act allows defendants only seven days in which to file appeals, while the Ordinance narrows that period even further to just three days. These provisions violate Article 14(b) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which entitles any person charged with committing criminal offenses """"to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense."""" Both the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Ordinance include provisions stating that they override other laws. Military courts have relied on this provision in exercising jurisdiction over children under the age of 16, in violation of the Sindh Children Act, a law operative in Sindh province. The Sindh Children Act specifies the courts that may hear juvenile cases, prohibits the joint trials of adults and minors, and bars the imposition of the death penalty on children. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is binding on Pakistan, also prohibits the use of capital punishment on children under the age of 18. There have been at least two cases to date in which military courts have tried children under the age of sixteen.  On January 12, 1999, Military Trial Court No. 6 ordered the medical examination of a teenage boy -- charged with firing on a paramilitary rangers patrol, killing one ranger and injuring another -- in order to determine his age. The medical board established by the court determined that Taha, son of Naeem Ahmad Khan, was between fifteen and sixteen years of age when the crime in question was committed, and was therefore a child for the purposes of the Sindh Children Act. Despite this finding, the court proceeded to try him, along with four young adults charged in the same case. The court indicated that it was proceeding toward a conviction of Taha and three other defendants at the trial's conclusion on January 28, 1999, but has not yet ruled on the case. Taha could face the death penalty if convicted.  In an earlier case, fourteen-year old Mohammed Saleem was sentenced to death by Military Trial Court No. 2 on December 19, 1998, after being convicted along with three adult men of murdering three police officers from Karachi's Ibrahim Hyderi police station. A military appellate court acquitted him on January 6, 1999, but in doing so, effectively rejected the defense counsel's argument that military courts could not lawfully exercise jurisdiction over minors. Human Rights Watch urged the government of Pakistan to repeal the Pakistan Armed Forces (Acting in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 1988, and immediately dismantle the military courts currently operating in Karachi. It further called for the transfer of cases presently before the military courts to ordinary courts of law, and where children were involved as defendants, to courts authorized by the Sindh Children Act to try juveniles. The organization also recommended the legislative repeal of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and the abolition of the anti-terrorism courts established under the act.","Asia, Pakistan",""

In discussing the impact of the arms trade and human rights, we now often hear the argument: """"If in Rwanda so many were killed with machetes, what is the point of restricting the trade in arms?"""" This argument has been a convenient tool in the hands of those who wish to deflect attention from their own responsibility in restraining arms transfers. And the machete claim is a myth, based on a misunderstood reality. The people wielding the machetes in Rwanda operated in an environment in which a heavily armed movement (combination government and militias) provided the necessary protection and encouragement for the killers. If this environment had been different """"if the government and allied militias had not been so well armed"""" perhaps there would have been a relatively level playing field. There might have been a nasty conflict but perhaps not a genocide.   The arms in the hands of the Rwandan génocidaires were supplied by France, apartheid-era South Africa, Egypt, and others. France of course provided more than just arms to its Rwandan allies, and even during the genocide it continued to offer military support, though much less openly.   In Sudan, the protracted civil war-in which close to 2 million persons may have died either from the fighting or from war-related famine and disease since 1983-has been fueled by many countries that have poured weapons and other forms of military assistance into the Horn in recent years, despite the existence of huge cold war-era stocks. They include, among others, China, France, Iran, Iraq, Russia, South Africa, Uganda, and the United States. In the brutal civil war in Burundi, China has shipped arms to the government by sea and rail via Tanzania and Uganda in the mid-1990s, while weapons have been flown straight into Bujumbura airport from Bulgaria and elsewhere even recently. In Iraq, Swiss Pilatus planes were used for military purposes by the Iraqi air force, including in chemical attacks on Kurdish rebels and civilians in 1987-88. In Congo today, Zimbabwan planes and Angolan armor have been deployed on the government's side, while the Ugandan and Rwandan militaries (supplied by the United States, South Africa, and others) have sent heavily armed troops to fight on the side of the rebels.   In all of these wars, governments-along with rebel forces-have been involved in gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war). In most cases, other governments supplied the weapons to arm these abusive parties, and yet other governments winked at the transshipment of these weapons through their national territories. These governments are, by their acts of commission or omission or by sheer neglect, accessories to the abuses that are being committed. If the abuses rise to the level of war crimes, they may be accessories to war crimes, even genocide.     The """"Legitimate"""" Trade, the Illicit Trade,  and the Responsibility of Governments   This important reality-the role of governments in the arms trade-received no explicit reflection in the otherwise very useful first report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms in 1997. That report's focus was on the illicit trade: arms transfers that violate either national or international laws. This was also the report's principal weakness. Yet it was predictable: The report was prepared by governments, and governments naturally seek to protect and advance their interests, in this case what they call the """"legitimate"""" international trade in arms.   The Experts' report predated the emerging campaign on small arms and light weapons, which is a joint effort by nongovernmental organizations and supposedly """"like-minded"""" governments to tackle the proliferation question, modeled to some extent on the successful landmines campaign. But this is not the landmines campaign. NGOs learned from the landmines campaign and said: """"Let's do that again!"""" Governments also learned from the landmines campaign, and said, with a few notable exceptions: """"Let's make sure this never happens again!"""" Some governments, by dragging their feet, are sending signals that perhaps they are not so eager to go along with the campaign. For example, the government of the United States, the foremost arms exporter in the world, has not been responsive to a request by U.S.-based NGOs to discuss a 10-point agenda, forwarded several months ago.   Even some of the """"like-minded"""" governments are trying to steer the campaign away from putting governmental responsibility in the spotlight. What to make, otherwise, of the proposal by the Canadian government-which has been a leader on landmines, on the International Criminal Court, on so many important issues-to pursue a treaty that would bar arms transfers to non-state actors? And what to make of the main thrust of many governments, heartily supported by the United States, to go after the illicit trade? Their minds may be alike on this issue, but they are out of tune with NGO sentiment, as well as with the reality of the arms trade today. It is good to remember that the small-arms campaign is, like the landmines campaign before it, an NGO initiative that has been embraced-with varying degrees of enthusiasm-by governments, and that NGOs have kept the pace by drafting proposals and monitoring states' actions, applauding them when they make positive contributions and criticizing them when they run afoul of the overall goals.   The way most governments want to tackle the proliferation issue is to make it a problem of crime involving shady dealers, shadowy terrorists, and undisciplined and unaccountable guerrilla bands. How easy it would be! In that case, all one needs to do is throw some money at police and customs authorities, and voilà! Progress.     The Way Forward   We are not against strengthening police and customs capabilities and enhancing police cooperation on regional and national levels. To the contrary: We encourage such technical measures, as we do marking. But technical solutions will fail to address the problem adequately if governments fail to assume moral, if not legal, responsibility for how the arms they """"legally"""" export or allow to cross their territory end up being used by others. Governments should be pressed to adopt a universal norm: Supply no arms to forces-be they governments or non-state actors-that are involved in gross violations of human rights or international humanitarian law. And they should turn that norm into law-and enforce it!   Here are some measures that would go some ways toward that goal:   Greater transparency in government-sponsored or -approved arms transfers. Transparency mechanisms are key to combating transfers to abusive end users of weapons. They have been incorporated in the U.N. conventional arms register, and in the European code of conduct and other similar draft codes. They need to be reinforced. One way to enhance transparency is to ensure that national parliaments-mandated by their constituencies to make their governments more accountable-are fully integrated in the decision making process governing arms transfers.   An international code of conduct governing arms exports. The code drafted by the Nobel laureates is a good model, and the European Union's code of conduct, full of loopholes and not binding, is nonetheless a useful first step toward a stronger and binding code in Europe. The United States, Russia and China are far behind. Much energy is needed here.   International and regional arms embargoes. Embargoes are only as good as their implementation and enforcement. When the most prominent states that were party to the decision to impose an embargo are found to be circumventing it (France in Rwanda, the United States in Bosnia, the United Kingdom in Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda in Burundi), embargoes lose not only their effectiveness but also their legitimacy as a tool to send a signal to abusive actors that they cannot continue business as usual.   Responsible disposal of excess stocks. As states seeking admission to or partnership with NATO are downsizing their militaries and upgrading their weapons to NATO standard, huge stocks of arms are likely to be thrown onto the open market. The likely destiny for the vast majority of these weapons-which will be cheap and in abundance-are the areas of armed conflict in Africa and elsewhere. NATO governments and their partners have an obligation to dispose of their excess arms stocks in a responsible fashion, be it through export, destruction, or other means.   Marking weapons. This is a very useful tool that will increase the accountability of governments whose weapons turn up in areas of armed conflict, even if they did not export these arms directly to the parties to the conflict. For example, we found Belgian anti-tank landmines in Sudan in 1987, shipped there apparently via Saudi Arabia. Italian antipersonnel landmines have been used in eastern Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), supplied apparently via Egypt. South African and German automatic rifles have turned up in the Great Lakes region. And Chilean cluster bombs were used by the government of Sudan against the SPLA in the south in 1987, and by Eritrea against Ethiopia last year; it is likely that Chile supplied these cluster bombs to Ethiopia in 1990. Inventories, marking and proper documentation will help ensure that weapons exported for legitimate purposes will also be used legitimately by the recipient marked on the end-user certificate.   While no one labors under the illusion that the trade in small arms and light weapons can be drastically reduced fast, the important point is to remember that forces engaged in armed conflict do not just receive military support when they receive weapons. They also receive a signal, a powerful signal that whatever they are doing is okay; that states, the """"international community,"""" will close an eye to the abuses these forces commit.   In other words, arms transfers can embolden genocidal forces, as we have seen in Rwanda, or stoke the flames of long, drawn-out conflicts with hundreds of thousands of casualties, as we have seen in Sudan. To prevent the emergence of cultures of impunity in which these abuses thrive, governments must apply a moral imperative that takes precedence over actions informed by real politik or commercial impulses. It is far too easy and not at all persuasive to throw up one's hands in anguish over the horrendous abuses this world has witnessed, and then sit back and blame the traffickers.

Earlier this week, Vienna city councillor Peter Pilz filed a complaint against Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, the vice-chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) and top aide to Saddam Hussein, who is in a Vienna hospital. Izzat Ibrahim is the deputy commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. During Iraq's 1988 campaign of genocide against the northern Kurdish population, Ibrahim helped execute Iraq's """"policy of mass murder,"""" according to a Human Rights Watch book on that campaign. After the 1991 Gulf war and the ensuing Kurdish uprising, Ibrahim was the commander for the north, with full authority to """"reward and punish."""" """"This man is Saddam Hussein's right hand. He has been involved in some of Iraq's worst crimes -- including genocide,"""" said Reed Brody, the Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Austria has a clear legal obligation to bring him to justice -- and the international community should back his prosecution."""" According to press reports, Ibrahim arrived in Vienna on August 6 for treatment at a private clinic. The Austrian interior ministry said he had been granted a one-month visa for humanitarian reasons. Who is Izzat Ibrahim? Izzat Ibrahim has long been a leading figure in the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. In the mid-1970s he was Minister of Interior, and for most of the period since 1979, when Saddam Hussein took over as president and head of the Revolutionary Command Council, Ibrahim has served as Deputy Chair of the RCC, effectively the number two position in the government. During the genocidal Anfal campaign against Iraq's Kurdish population in 1988, Ibrahim was also a member of the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee which, along with the Ba'th Party's Northern Bureau Command, was the administrative backbone for the military campaign headed by Ali Hassan al-Majid. The Northern Affairs Committee placed its seal on a June 20, 1987 directive, coded SF/4008, which called for """"special strikes, ...to kill the largest number of persons"""" in designated zones, as well as the capture and execution of all adults found in prohibited areas. Human Rights Watch, in its 1995 book Iraq's Crime of Genocide, called this directive the baldest possible statement of a policy of mass murder, ordered by the highest levels of the Iraqi regime."""" The directive remained in force as the standing orders for Iraqi armed forces and security services throughout the Anfal campaign and beyond. At the time of the Gulf War and the Kurdish uprising against the government that followed, Ibrahim held the post of commander for the north, with full authority to """"reward and punish,"""" in the words of the decree appointing him. Izzat Ibrahim was reported in the Washington Post on January 24, 1991, as warning the people of Sulaimaniyya, a major city in the Kurdish north, that """"if you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to remind you that we are ready to repeat the operation."""" Halabja was the Kurdish city that was the target of a major Iraqi chemical weapons assault on March 16, 1988 which killed between 3,200 and 5,000 residents. The Legal Basis for a Prosecution in Austria According to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which Austria is a party, Austria is under an international legal obligation to bring to trial -- or to extradite -- persons on its territory accused of torture, no matter where the torture was committed. Similarly, under the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which Austria ratified in 1958, Austria undertook to prevent and to punish acts of genocide. The British House of Lords, in the Pinochet case, affirmed the United Kingdom's obligation to """"prosecute or punish"""" General Pinochet under the UN Torture Convention for alleged acts of torture.  Austria's domestic criminal law also allows such prosecutions. Article 64 of the Austrian Penal Code provides that certain offenses committed abroad can be prosecuted in the Austrian courts . These include (in Article 64.6) """"criminal acts which Austria is under an obligation to punish even when they have been committed abroad"""" -- such as the obligation under the UN Torture and Genocide Conventions. The offence of genocide is defined in Article 321.

They were questioned in connection with an article about Zimbabwe's military intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Published on October 30, the article told the story of a Zimbabwean family who had received only the head of their son, without the body, after he was killed in action in the DRC. Kwinjeh, the author of the story, received threatening telephone calls after the story was printed. All four appeared in court on February 10. Charges were dropped on Gonçalves and Mungazi, but Kwinjeh and Mandaza where charged with violating Article 50 (2a) of the Law and Order Maintenance Act and released on US$135 bail. They are required to register with the police once a week. Their case will next be heard on March 1. Human Rights Watch is worried that these new arrests may mark a crackdown on the independent media. Two other independent journalists, Mark Chavunduka and Roy Choto, were arrested in January 1999, detained incommunicado and tortured by military intelligence officials. A doctor's examination after their release on bail on January 21 confirmed their allegations of torture.

The organization called for the interim agreement to include an unequivocal obligation by all parties (Kosovo Albanians, Serbians, and authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)) to """"co-operate immediately and fully"""" with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which has a United Nations mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes in Kosovo. Specifically, the accord should oblige all parties to provide tribunal personnel visa-free access to the territory and give them unfettered rights to interview witnesses and gather evidence. It should also commit the parties to arrest all indicted war criminals present in FRY and transfer them to the tribunal in The Hague.   """"It looks like the Contact Group may let justice drop off the table at Rambouillet,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"A verbal commitment to try war criminals is not enough. The agreement must include concrete, binding and enforceable obligations on the parties to assist the tribunal.""""   Since February 1998, the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army, under the control of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes by attacking non-combatants, executing detainees and systematically destroying civilian property, Human Rights Watch said. Although on a lesser scale than government forces, the Kosovo Liberation Army also has kidnaped civilians and committed some summary executions. Human Rights Watch carries the reports of its investigations into these abuses on its website at Crisis in Kosovo.   Early drafts of the accord circulating before the negotiations began contained stronger language on the jurisdiction of the tribunal in Kosovo, but later drafts have been watered down and ask only for """"co-operation"""" with the tribunal. The current wording is not explicit enough and would allow the parties to evade their obligations to the tribunal, as has happened in Bosnia under the Dayton peace accords. The Yugoslav government has systematically refused to implement tribunal provisions in the Dayton accords, including the obligation to arrest indicted war criminals known to reside in Yugoslavia.   Human Rights Watch is concerned that a similar pattern is emerging in the Kosovo conflict. """"The October agreement for a cease-fire in Kosovo omitted an explicit written commitment to cooperate with the tribunal,"""" Cartner explained. """"As a result, the Tribunal has faced repeated obstruction to its work. And, as evidenced by the recent massacres, the parties to the conflict have been left to conclude that they can continue to commit atrocities with impunity.""""   Human Rights Watch recommended that the Contact Group include the following points regarding war crimes in the interim accord:   1. The parties agree to co-operate immediately and fully with the tribunal pursuant to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions.   2. The parties publicly recognize the jurisdiction of the tribunal to conduct investigations in Kosovo.   3. The parties agree to arrest and detain all persons indicted by the tribunal who reside or transit through any part of Serbia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Arrested war criminals will be transferred to the custody of the tribunal.   4. The parties agree to provide tribunal personnel with visa-free entry into FRY to conduct unrestricted investigations.   5. The parties commit to provide any and all judicial assistance requested by the tribunal, such as the taking of testimony, access to and production of evidence, and provision of documents.   6. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Kosovo Verification Mission should have an explicit mandate to assist the tribunal in all possible ways with its work, including the identification of witnesses to war crimes, the procurement of evidence, and information on KLA and Yugoslav command structure. The Mission should also be responsible for escorting and assisting tribunal personnel, if requested.   7. If NATO troops are deployed, they should provide a secure environment in Kosovo for tribunal investigators.   8. If NATO troops are deployed, they should have an explicit mandate to arrest indicted war criminals.   9. No concessions will be granted to the Yugoslav or Serbian governments, such as the lifting of the so-called """"outer wall"""" of sanctions, until the tribunal certifies that the above conditions have been met.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Mr Endang came to meet me to describe the human rights violations that shrimp farmers employed by the Wachyuni Mandira Company experienced. It is utterly outrageous that he should be arrested under these circumstances, and we are seeking his immediate release,"""" said Jones.  Endang helped organize shrimp farmers from the village of Bumi Pratama Mandira in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI), South Sumatra. In September 1998, under his leadership, shrimp farmers, who took out large loans under company auspices on the promise that they would eventually own their own shrimp farms, began to demand to know the status of their indebtedness and the terms of repayment. The company had never provided information on either, according to the farmers. Endang also successfully led the fight for a higher living stipend for all the shrimp farmers working under contract to the company.  On November 15, 1998, after almost two months of protests, a riot broke out at the company that ended in hundreds of farmers wrecking company property. The man who has publicly acknowledged responsibility for setting the fire that started the riot was never arrested and is now reported to be working as a company employee. Local police put a price on Endang's head as the organizer of the protests, but to Human Rights Watch's knowledge, there is no evidence that he had anything to do with the violence that erupted. More than 600 farmers, many of whom were not involved in the riot, were forced to sign letters of resignation in the weeks that followed; some forty were arrested and are facing charges of arson and destruction of property.  Endang was arrested in the late afternoon on Monday about one hundred meters from the office of the Legal Aid Institute in Palembang by three policemen who had been watching the office since morning, according to another shrimp farmer.

As Serbian-Albanian negotiations over the disputed province got underway outside Paris, Human Rights Watch released a new report """"A Week of Terror in Drenica"""" with further evidence of Yugoslav government atrocities in the conflict.   Human Rights Watch called on the Contact Group of nations dealing with the former Yugoslavia to ensure that a political settlement does not stand in the way of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his top military planners being held accountable for atrocities committed by government forces in Kosovo. These include attacks on civilians, the destruction of civilian property, and summary executions -- all war crimes under international law.   In the report released today, """"A Week of Terror in Drenica,"""" Human Rights Watch presents new, detailed documentation of Yugoslav government war crimes in the Drenica region of Kosovo during the last week of September 1998. The report describes how special units of the Serbian Ministry of Interior massacred twenty-one members of the Delijaj family, all of them civilians, in Gornje Obrinje, and then summarily executed thirteen men in the neighboring village of Golubovac. Most of the surrounding villages were systematically looted and destroyed, even though government forces faced no resistance.   An appendix to the report provides Human Rights Watch's newest findings of the massacre in Racak on January 15, 1999, in which special forces killed forty-five ethnic Albanian civilians. The massacre sparked the latest crisis in Western policy toward Kosovo and led to today's negotiations in Rambouillet.   """"After a tragic delay, the international community is finally addressing the Kosovo crisis with resolve,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"But any political settlement must ensure accountability for these terrible crimes.""""   Roth called on the countries of the Contact Group (Russia, France, Great Britain, the U.S., Germany, and Italy) to increase their financial and political support for the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, officially known as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The international community should press the Yugoslav government to guarantee full access for war crimes investigators, he said, and to arrest indicted war criminals on its territory. Intelligence information, such as the recorded telephone conversations released last week between Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and General Sreten Lukic over the massacre in Racak, should be regularly provided to the tribunal.   The war crimes tribunal has a United Nations mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed in Kosovo, but the Yugoslav government has rejected its jurisdiction and blocked its investigators.   Human Rights Watch also stressed that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has committed serious abuses, including the taking of hostages and extrajudicial executions. These atrocities have been documented in previous Human Rights Watch reports and will continue to be the subject of investigation. Under no circumstances, however, can the Yugoslav government use abuses by the KLA as justification for committing abuses against ethnic Albanian civilians.

I write to express our concern regarding reports that Anahid Tumaniyan, a forty-five-year-old resident of Yerevan, her two children—sixteen-year-old Aram and twenty-two-year-old Varduhi Tumaniyan—and her twenty-year-old sister-in-law, Christina Torosiyan, were severely beaten over a period of several days while in the custody of the Erebuni District Police Station after their arrest on February 16, 1998. Ms. Tumaniyan and her two children, Aram and Varduhi, were arrested by plainclothes police officers of the criminal investigation department of the Erebuni District Police Station at approximately 10:30 p.m. on February 16. Erebuni police officials also arrested Ms. Torosiyan at approximately the same time at her nearby home. Ms. Tumaniyan told Human Rights Watch that about ten plainclothes police officers arrived at her home, and that despite repeated requests by her and other family members present, police officers refused to inform Ms. Tumaniyan or her children of the reasons for their arrests. Subsequent to the arrest, police officers are reported to have carried out a search without warrant of Ms. Tumaniyan's home. Upon arrival at the Erebuni police station at approximately 1:00 a.m. on February 17, Ms. Tumaniyan was questioned by Erebuni District Police Chief Kharapetiyan and five other plainclothes officers. Mr. Kharapetiyan questioned Ms. Tumaniyan regarding a debt she had incurred to an acquaintance whose death the police were investigating. According to Ms. Tumaniyan, she was repeatedly beaten and questioned about her involvement in the murder from the time she arrived until 5:00 a.m. She told Human Rights Watch that during questioning she could hear Aram, Varduhi, and Christina in nearby investigation rooms, crying out as police officers struck them. She reported that her son Aram was brought into the investigation room where she was being questioned, and that police officers repeatedly beat him in her presence until he lost consciousness. Ms. Tumaniyan stated that police officers were attempting to coerce a confession from her son that he was guilty of the murder, and testimony from Ms. Tumaniyan that she was a material witness. Ms. Tumaniyan stated that she was kept in the investigation room until 10:00 a.m. on February 17. At 10:00 a.m. her daughter Varduhi was brought into the investigation room, and reportedly beaten by plainclothes police officers in an attempt to coerce testimony from her that Varduhi had also participated in the murder. According to Ms. Tumaniyan, at approximately 11:00 p.m. (she was kept in the investigation room throughout the day) Christina was brought into the room, and also repeatedly beaten and questioned in her presence. Ms. Tumaniyan told Human Rights Watch that she was kept in the investigation room under continued questioning and physical abuse, without food, until February 18. She was subsequently released and rearrested at her home on the morning of February 20. She stated that she was taken to the Erebuni District Procuracy office, where she was questioned by Vardan Martirosyan, a procuracy investigator. Ms. Tumaniyan reported to Human Rights Watch that she again refused to sign false testimony, and that Mr. Martirosyan ordered her to be taken to an investigation room to be beaten. She reported further that three plainclothes Erebuni police officers placed her hand on a table and broke her finger in order to coerce her into signing false testimony. On September 8, 1998, the trial of Varduhi and Aram Tumaniyan commenced in Erebuni District Court on robbery and murder charges (Articles 88 and 99 of the Armenian criminal code). Christina Torosiyan was tried during the same proceedings under Article 206, failure to report a crime. Witnesses to the proceedings reported to Human Rights Watch that on September 9, Erebuni District Court Judge Lova Simoniyan made threatening and prejudicial statements about Varduhi during open court proceedings. During testimony in which Varduhi repeatedly denied her involvement in the murder, Judge Simoniyan is reported to have said, """"I'll do something to you so you'll never be able to bear children that are like you."""" Witnesses reported that during the proceedings on September 10, Judge Simoniyan stated to Aram, after he denied his involvement, """"If I had the right, I would put you up against a wall and shoot you."""" The conduct of the criminal proceedings and trial described above contravenes Armenia's obligations as a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) . Prejudicial public statements by judges prior to or during court proceedings violate the ICCPR's Article 14, which guarantees individuals the right to a """"fair and public hearing by a[n] . . . independent and impartial tribunal,"""" and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Physical abuse is a violation of the ICCPR's Article 7, which states, """"no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."""" We urge you to investigate immediately allegations that Ms. Tumaniyan, her children, and Ms. Torosiyan were severely beaten by Erebuni police officers. We further urge you to prosecute those police found to be involved, and to make the results of the investigation public. We call on you to investigate reports that Erebuni District Court Judge Simoniyan made threatening and prejudicial statements during open court proceedings, and, if these statements are confirmed, to discipline him accordingly. We look forward to your response to these concerns.

Sellers was convicted of three murders committed in 1986 when he was sixteen years old.  Again, the United States has put itself outside the bounds of accepted international standards by executing an individual for crimes committed before the age of eighteen,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We are deeply disappointed that neither Governor Keating nor the Oklahoma Board of Pardons and Paroles were willing to grant clemency to Sean Sellers. Their failure to do so puts our nation in the company of countries like Iran, Nigeria and Pakistan in defying a global consensus against such executions.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that this is the fourth juvenile offender executed in the United States in the past twelve months. During 1998, three individuals -- two in Texas and one in Virginia -- were executed for crimes committed at age seventeen. Sellers is the first individual in the United States in forty years to be executed for crimes committed at age sixteen.  No other country is known to have carried out judicial executions of juvenile offenders in 1998. Those put to death in the United States last year were Joseph Cannon, executed in Texas on April 22, Robert Anthony Carter, executed in Texas on May 18, and Dwight Allen Wright, executed in Virginia on October 14. All three individuals were not only juveniles at the time of their crime, but reportedly were also brain damaged.  """"To put to death persons who were not only minors at the times of their crimes, but also suffer from brain damage or mental illness, violates the most basic principles of justice and morality,"""" said Whitman.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, expressly forbids capital punishment for offenders who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense for which they were convicted. Although the US conditioned its ratification of the ICCPR to allow it to continue this widely-rejected practice, other countries have criticized the US for entering this reservation against the spirit of the treaty. The use of the death penalty against juvenile offenders is also banned by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by every country in the world except for the United States and Somalia.","United States","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Both men were arrested in January 1999 in connection with a story printed in the Standard on January 10, 1999 alleging a plot within in the ZNA to over throw your government.  On January 12 Standard editor Mark Chavunduka was illegally arrested by the ZNA's military police. He was detained incommunicado for six days at Cranborne military barracks in Harare, in defiance of a January 14 High Court judgment ordering Minister Moven Mahachi and Major Mhonda of the ZNA to release him. Ray Choto turned himself over to the civilian police on January 19, after the ZNA sought to arrest him in connection with the story. The two were taken to Harare police headquarters on January 19 to give statements to the civilian police and were handed over to military police and alleged that they were tortured for 24 hours at a torture center on a farm outside Harare. Chavunduka and Choto claim that their torture included beatings with fists, wooden planks and rubber batons, the use of electric shocks to the body and genitals, and having their heads wrapped in plastic bags and submerged in water tanks. Both men were threatened with death if they did not reveal the sources of their information and were told their relatives would be tortured too. After their release they were handed back to civilian police, and were taken to hospital. Chavanduka and Choto were released on bail on January 21 and charged under the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act with publishing false information likely to cause alarm, fear or despondency to the public. Since their release a doctor who examined them has confirmed that he found evidence of injuries consistent with their allegations of torture. Human Rights Watch has obtained a copy of this report. They are due to appear in court again on February 22. Human Rights Watch believes that Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were imprisoned and tortured solely on account of their legitimate activities as journalists andcall for the charges against them to be withdrawn. We also call for an immediate inquiry into their unlawful detention and into the allegations that their captors threatened to kill the two and torture their families unless they revealed their sources. The officers in charge of the two men while they were in detention should be suspended from duty pending an independent inquiry into the torture allegations. We also believe that the findings of such an investigation need to be made public, and for those responsible to be brought to justice. We would like to remind you that these arrests, incarceration and ill-treatment contravene Articles 5 and 19 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights which Zimbabwe has signed, and Article 7 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are sure that it is in your own interest and that of your governments to respect these international laws and covenants. We look forward to hearing your response.

After a detailed investigation, the organization accused Serbian special police forces and the Yugoslav army of indiscriminately attacking civilians, torturing detainees, and committing summary executions. The evidence suggests that government forces had direct orders to kill village inhabitants over the age of fifteen.   The killing of forty-five ethnic Albanian civilians has provoked an apparent shift in western policy toward Kosovo, which the Contact Group is meeting in London today to discuss.   A report in the Washington Post yesterday provided excerpts from telephone conversations between Serbian Interior Ministry General Sreten Lukic and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, who clearly ordered government security forces to """"go in heavy"""" in Ra ak. The two officials later discussed ways that the killings might be covered up to avoid international condemnation.   Human Rights Watch conducted separate interviews in Kosovo with fourteen witnesses to the attack, many of whom are hiding out of fear for their lives, as well as with foreign journalists and observers who visited Racak on January 16. Together, the testimonies suggest a well planned and executed attack by government forces on civilians in Racak, where the KLA had a sizable presence and had conducted some ambushes on police patrols.   As has happened on numerous occasions in the Kosovo conflict, once the KLA retreated, government forces moved in and committed atrocities against the residents of the village. While it is possible that some residents may have defended their homes in the morning, most were clearly not involved in any armed resistance. At least twenty-three people were summarily executed by the police while offering no resistance -- a clear violation of the laws of war, and a crime punishable by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).   Villagers told consistent stories of how government forces rounded up, tortured, and then apparently executed the twenty-three ethnic Albanians on a hill outside of the village. Two witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch saw these men being beaten by the police and then taken off in the direction of the hill. Local villagers, foreign journalists, and diplomatic observers who saw the bodies the next day said that the victims had been shot from close range, most of them in the head; some of them appeared to have been shot while running away. Four men are known to have survived.   Eighteen other people were killed inside Ra ak, including a twelve-year-old boy and at least two female civilians, as well as nine soldiers of the KLA. At least one civilian, Nazmi Ymeri (76), was executed in his yard. Witnesses claim that Banush Kamberi, whose headless body was found in his yard, was last seen alive in the custody of the police. At least two people, Bajram Mehmeti and his daughter Hanumshahe (20), were killed by a grenade thrown by the police as they were running through the street.   Human Rights Watch confirmed that a group of approximately forty policeman, in blue uniforms and without masks, shot from a distance of twenty meters on unarmed civilians who were running through their yards. They killed Riza Beqa (44), Zejnel Beqa (22), and Halim Beqa (12), and wounded two women, Zyhra Beqa (42) and her daughter Fetije (18). It is believed that local policemen from the nearby Stimlje police station participated in this action.   The attack on civilians in Ra ak is one in a long series of war crimes committed by the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police during the Kosovo conflict. Since February 1998, government troops have systematically destroyed civilian property, attacked civilians, and committed summary executions, all of which are grave breaches of the laws of war. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has also committed some serious abuses, such as the taking of civilian hostages and summary executions. The KLA in the Shtimle and Suva Reka area was particularly known for a high number of kidnappings of ethnic Serbs.   Human Rights Watch called on the Yugoslav government to allow an unhindered investigation by international forensics experts and the war crimes tribunal to determine the precise nature of events. Government authorities, directly implicated in the crime, cannot be trusted to conduct an impartial investigation.   The organization also called on the international community to take resolute action against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his government for brazenly violating international humanitarian law. International inaction in the face of past atrocities, the organization said, gave President Milosevic the rightful impression that he could continue his abusive campaign with impunity.   Finally, Human Rights Watch called on the Contact Group to insist that the Chief Prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, be granted access to Ra ak and other sites of atrocities in Kosovo.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

""""This is the first time in our experience in Colombia that human rights defenders have been kidnaped in such a brutal and open manner,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"Colombia continues to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for human rights defenders."""" Vivanco added that last year alone, five human rights defenders were murdered in Colombia. Over a year ago, the Colombian government authorized one million dollars to be spent on an emergency fund meant to protect human rights defenders from attack. Nevertheless, until now, little or nothing has been done to protect the offices of human rights groups despite the urgency expressed by national and international monitors. The employees are Jairo Bedoya, the director of the IPC; Claudia Tamayo, planning and development coordinator; Jorge Salazar, human rights investigator; and Olga Rodas, office manager.  According to information received by Human Rights Watch, a group of well-armed individuals in Chevrolet Luv pick up trucks blocked off the IPC offices at about 4 p.m. yesterday. Five of them -- one woman and four men -- entered the offices and seized the approximately 25 people gathered there. Although the armed group identified itself initially as members of a guerrilla-linked militia, they later said that they were paramilitaries and that they would “not permit the growth of Communism?in the IPC. In the past, Colombia’s paramilitary groups, which often work with the tacit or open support of Colombia’s military, have accused human rights groups of supporting leftist insurgents. After asking for the directors of the IPC, the group selected four individuals and bound their hands before taking them away. The group also took two portable computers and the identity cards of nine of the other men present. """"When I spoke to President Pastrana in the presidential palace last October, I told him of my deep concern for the absence of government action to protect human rights defenders,"""" said Vivanco. """"Today, I ask myself: How many more defenders have to suffer before the authorities take the necessary measures to protect them?"""" Human Rights Watch urgently called on Colombian authorities to adopt the necessary measures to bring about the safe release of these four human rights defenders. The organization also stressed to the forces currently holding them that these individuals are not combatants in Colombia’s armed conflict and therefore are explicitly protected by the laws of war.

On January 25, 1999, when Human Rights Watch published a 166-page book exposing Enron's complicity in human rights abuse connected with the Dabhol Power Corporation, a company spokesperson was quoted in the press as saying that all the problems there had been """"put to rest."""" """"This isn't a problem of the past - it's a problem right now,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"Villagers who protested against the project are still facing imprisonment, because police have trumped up charges against them. Enron isn't helping solve this problem by denying responsibility once again."""" Roth noted that protests are no longer taking place outside the front gates of the power plant, where police forces paid by the company repeatedly quelled peaceful demonstrations by attacking the protesters, beating them with canes and arresting them. But he said the protests have fallen silent because the local police have outlawed any kind of demonstration in the area around the plant, thereby depriving people of their right to free speech. Since December 1996, the police have issued a continuous series of orders banning the """"public utterance of cries, singing of songs, playing of music""""and the """"delivery of harangues, the use of gestures or mimetic representations, and the preparation, exhibition or dissemination of pictures, symbols, placards or any other object or thing which may in the opinion of such authority offend against decency or morality...."""" These provisions have been used as the justification for criminalizing demonstrations against the company. The orders expire every fifteen days and are routinely renewed. Many energy companies have invested in closed, repressive countries -- and made the argument that their investment would help develop the local economy and thereby improve the human rights situation, said Human Rights Watch. But in this case, Enron has invested in a democratic country, in a region with no significant strife -- and human rights abuses there have increased. """"Enron hasn't made things better for human rights; it has made things worse,"""" said Roth. """"Through misuse of laws and abuse of power, the police have crushed open and organized dissent against the company.""""  Spokespeople for Enron have complained that company officials were not interviewed for the report and did not receive advance copies of it. Human Rights Watch used the company's public statements to the Indian press and to Amnesty International, as well as internal company documents, in preparing the section of the report on Enron's response to charges of human rights abuse.  Human Rights Watch provided copies of the report to company officials five days before the release date of January 25, 1999 and invited the company's response. However, Human Rights Watch has not received any direct response from the company. Roth noted that the plant will become operational in March 1999, and Enron is planning major new investments in India. He urged Enron to take steps to ensure the company's operations do not contribute to violations of human rights in the future.","Asia, India","Economic Justice and Rights"

""""This is just a cynical attempt to get Pinochet back home where he will be safe from justice,"""" said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Chilean government knows that its judiciary cannot prosecute Pinochet."""" Human Rights Watch submitted a statement by former Chilean Ambassador and former Chilean Bar Association Director Roberto Garret detailing the obstacles preventing a trial in Chile. First among these is the April 1978 amnesty from prosecution that the Chilean military granted itself for the crimes committed from September 1973 through March 1978- the period during which the bulk of Pinochet's crimes were committed. The Chilean Supreme Court has refused on several occasions to reconsider this self-amnesty. A final obstacle to the prosecution of Pinochet in Chile is the likelihood that he would be tried before a military tribunal because he was commander-in-chief at the time of his crimes. Military courts in Chile are staffed by military officers who have an unbroken record of preventing the prosecution of any military official for crimes committed during the 1973 coup and its aftermath. Brody discounted yesterday's suggestion by Chilean Foreign Minister José Miguel Insulza that the government might take part in cases now pending against Pinochet in Chile.

I write to express our concern regarding six Armenian citizens who are conscientious objectors and who are currently imprisoned for refusal to do military service on religious grounds, or who are in hiding due to continued harassment. There is no alternative service law in Armenia, and these cases are part of a broader pattern of systematic human rights violations against those who decline to perform military service due to their religious beliefs, which has persisted at least since 1993. This harassment, generally carried out by police and conscription commission officials, includes physical abuse and beatings of conscientious objectors, repeated visits by the conscription commission officials and police to family member's homes during early morning hours and at night, and warrantless searches of their homes. During these searches family members told Human Rights Watch that officials threaten and insult them because of their religious faith. In previous correspondence with you, we also documented hostage-taking of family members of conscientious objectors by police and conscription commission officials. Karen Voskanyan, an eighteen-year-old resident of Mashtots District, Yerevan, currently imprisoned at the Ministry of Defense Disciplinary Battalion at Hrazdan. In early May 1998, Mashtots District Conscription Commission officials detained Mr. Voskanyan at his home and took him to the conscription commission premises. Shortly after his arrival Mr. Voskanyan fled, and conscription officials then pursued him and detained him in the street in front of a nearby building. Mr. Voskanyan's lawyer reported to Human Rights Watch that officials beat him severely during his detention, so severely that one of the officials allegedly died of at the scene as a result of exertion. Upon hearing of the official's death, officials from the conscription commission are reported to have resumed beating Mr. Voskanyan in retaliation. Mr. Voskanyan's lawyer told Human Rights Watch that when Mr. Voskanyan's brother and mother, Haikan Sarkisyan, tried at one point to intervene to prevent the beating officials struck them as well. Following the incident, Mr. Voskanyan was detained at the Yerevan Military Police Department, and on May 14, 1998, was conscripted and sent to military unit No. 56952 in Gumri, despite his statements that we was a conscientious objector on religious grounds. His lawyer stated that upon arrival at the unit, Mr. Voskanyan reiterated that he was a conscientious objector, and subsequently, two officials of the Gumri unit—officer Navoyan, and noncommissioned officer Harutuniyan—beat him and threatened him with a knife in attempt to coerce him into serving. Mr. Voskanyan was tried and found guilty of willful refusal to perform military service (Article 257-a of the Armenian criminal code), at Gumri District Court. He is currently serving a sentence of three years in the Ministry of Defense Disciplinary Battalion at Hrazdan. At court, his lawyer stated that he raised the issue of the beating by Navoyan and Harutuniyan. During court proceedings, Mr. Voskanyan's lawyer reported that officer Navoyan admitted that he struck Mr. Voskanyan on the face, but denied he had threatened him with a knife. The judge refused to order military officials to discipline officer Navoyan, and declined to investigate the beating of Mr. Voskanyan's mother and brother by Mashtots District Conscription Commission officials. Andranik Kosyan, a twenty-four-year-old resident of Vanadzor, currently imprisoned in Sovietashen Closed Prison. On October 29, 1998, Mr. Kosyan was found guilty of evading required military service (Article 75 of the Armenian criminal code), and sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he is currently serving in Sovietashen Closed Prison. This is Mr. Kosyan's second imprisonment for evading of military service. On March 17, 1997, he was tried and convicted of the same charges, and was sentenced to one year imprisonment. On May 22, 1997, he was released by amnesty. Two days after his release on May 24, 1997, he reported that he presented himself at the Vanadzor police station as Armenian law requires of released convicts, but was not able to register. On June 6, 1997, he indicated that he again presented himself at the police station, where he was detained and immediately conscripted into military unit No. 58831, despite his statements that he was a conscientious objector on religious grounds. On June 19, 1997, Mr. Kosyan was taken to the Yerevan Military Police Department where, he reported, he was threatened by officials including the deputy warden, who took away his religious literature and told him that he would be deliberately sent to an area with heavy fighting to force him to take up arms. On August 30, 1997, he fled the Yerevan Military Police Department, but was detained again on January 12, 1998. On February 25, 1998, Mr. Kosyan's trial began at the Arabski District Court. His lawyer told Human Rights Watch that despite substantial medical evidence presented at court that Mr. Kosyan's health rendered him unfit to serve -- regardless of his status as a conscientious objector -- he was convicted of evading military service on October 29, 1998, and is currently imprisoned in Sovietashen Closed Prison. Samvel Manukyan, a twenty-year-old resident of Yerevan, currently imprisoned in Kosh Corrective Labor Colony. According to his lawyer, in December 1996, Mr. Manukyan was reportedly conscripted and taken to Konakir military unit No. 63858 in Yerevan, despite having declared himself a conscientious objector on religious grounds. He fled the unit on May 16, 1997, and was detained the same day. On July 15, 1997, he was convicted on Article 255-a, desertion, and sentenced to three years of imprisonment, which he is currently serving in Kosh Corrective Labor Colony. Artur Stepanyan, a twenty-two-year-old resident of Yerevan, currently imprisoned in Kosh Corrective Labor Colony. Former inmates of the Kosh Corrective Labor Colony told Human Rights Watch that Mr. Stepanyan is currently serving in the colony after having been tried and convicted of Article 255-a, desertion, after declaring himself a conscientious objector on religious grounds. The former inmates are Mr. Stepanyan's coreligionists who spoke and prayed with him regularly at the labor colony. Artashes Alexanyan, a twenty-four-year-old resident of Yerevan, currently on conditional release. Mr. Alexanyan was tried, convicted and sentenced in September 1994 for evading required military service (on Article 75) to one year in a corrective labor colony. Mr. Alexanyan told Human Rights Watch that after he served his sentence and was released, he was detained at home on December 14, 1996, at approximately 6:30 a.m. by officials of the Hortain District Conscription Commission and Hortain District Police. He stated that officials arrived at his home, searched it without a warrant, and, not finding him at home, threatened to physically abuse his father. Officials subsequently detained Mr. Alexanyan in a neighboring apartment. Mr. Alexanyan reported that he was detained in a cell at the Hortain District Conscription Commission after he stated that he was conscientious objector on religious grounds. On December 14, 1996, he was taken to the Yerordmas Military Induction Center in Yerevan, and forcibly conscripted. On May 16, 1997, Mr. Alexanyan was tried and sentenced to four years of imprisonment for willful refusal to perform military service (Article 257). On May 31, 1997, during his transfer from the Vanadzor Investigative Isolator to Sovietashen Closed Prison in Yerevan by train, he stated he was beaten by guards on the train when they discovered he had been sentenced for willful refusal to perform military service . He reported to Human Rights Watch that he was again beaten by officials of Sovietashen Closed Prison upon his arrival after they learned of his conviction for refusal to do military service. He was later transferred to Sovietashen Corrective Labor Colony, and was released conditionally on May 16, 1998, a status that does not permit him to travel and requires him to present himself regularly to police officials. Tigran Petrossyan, a twenty-one-year-old resident of Hortain district, Yerevan. Mr. Petrossyan was released on October 26, 1998, but has been forced into hiding due to continued harassment from Ministry of Defense conscription commission officials. Mr. Petrossyan reported that he declared himself a conscientious objector in 1995. Mr. Petrossyan's mother, Avleta Garayan, told Human Rights Watch that subsequently she was repeatedly visited at her home by officials from the Soviet District Conscription Commission and the Yerevan military police, who threatened her and on one occasion told her that they intended to physically abuse her son once they detained him and conscripted him. In 1997, Mr. Petrossyan again declared to conscription officials his unwillingness to serve, and on August 21, 1997, was tried and sentenced to one year and six months on charges of evading required military service (Article 75). After his conviction, Amnesty International identified Mr. Petrossyan as a prisoner of conscience. After serving in Kosh Corrective Labor Colony, Mr. Petrossyan was freed on October 26 under a general amnesty adopted in September 1998. Yet Mrs. Garayan reported to Human Rights Watch that three days after his release on October 29, Hortain District Conscription Commission officials visited their home at approximately 7:30 p.m., conducted a search without a warrant despite her objections, and threatened and insulted her and other visitors in the apartment. Mr. Petrossyan is currently in hiding. We are aware, in addition to the six cases documented above, of at least fifteen individuals who have been subjected to similar treatment, and who are currently in hiding due to this systematic harassment. While some of these fifteen individuals were harassed and immediately forced into hiding, others were imprisoned, released and subsequently subjected to continued harassment following their release. We consider the harassment of prisoners who have already served sentences to be a particularly egregious example of abusive activity by Armenian officials. The government of Armenia is obliged to respect the rights of conscientious objectors. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has recognized conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Resolution 1989/59, and reaffirmed in Resolution 1993/84) . The Commission reinforced this position in 1995, when it called on U.N. member states to """"...if they have not already done so, . . enact legislation and . . . take measures aimed at exemption from military service on the basis of a genuinely held conscientious objection to armed service ( Resolution 1995/83)."""" Moreover, the Council of Europe, to which Armenia now seeks accession, supports the right to conscientious objection. In 1987, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers issued to all member states Recommendation No. R (87) 8, which states that """"anyone liable to conscription for military service who, for compelling reasons of conscience, refuses to be involved in the use of arms, shall have the right to be released from the obligation to perform such service..."""" The Committee of Ministers concomitantly called on members states to adopt laws to support this right. Human Rights Watch believes that domestic law should provide for alternative service based on religious or conscientious opposition to military service, and that each affected conscript should be permitted by law to secure a fair review of a claim of his right to engage in such alternative service. We view the lack of such a law and the harassment against conscientious objectors, described above, as a violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which upholds the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and guarantees individuals the right to """"manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching."""" Moreover, in view of the resolutions made by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and by the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, the detention of conscientious objectors in Armenia can be viewed only as arbitrary deprivation of liberty, which contravenes Article 9 of the ICCPR. Beating and other physical abuse of any individual is a gross violation of Article 7 of the ICCPR, which bans """"torture or . . . cruel or degrading treatment or punishment."""" We therefore urge you immediately to: - release Karen Voskanyan, Andranik Kosyan and Artur Stepanyan from imprisonment; - make Artashes Alexanyan's release unconditional; - investigate and prosecute all allegations that Ministry of Defense conscription officials and police have carried out a systematic, widespread campaign of harassment that includes physical abuse and threats against conscientious objectors and their family members; - adopt a law establishing alternative service to military service for those who declare themselves conscientious objectors, and begin immediate implementation of the law after its adoption.

The Ranvir Sena is a private militia of upper caste landlords. At least twenty-one people were killed, many at point-blank range. As the world focuses its attention on attacks on India's marginalized communities, including Christians and tribals in Orissa and Gujarat, attacks on members of scheduled castes (Dalits) in many parts of the country continue unabated.  In a letter released today, Human Rights Watch said the state government should:  Ensure that senior officials at the state and local levels publicize strong directives that civil servants and security officers found to be complicit in Ranvir Sena attacks, or found to take part in arbitrary raids, will be prosecuted;  Provide full security to villagers against further Ranvir Sena attacks and ensure that police pickets are placed away from upper caste areas to areas more accessible and secure for lower caste communities;  Appoint independent commissions to investigate and punish those responsible for attacks in affected districts, including any officials or members of the police who failed to respond to repeated calls for protection for villagers or to prosecute previous acts of violence;  Ensure that all districts affected by caste clashes (particularly Jehanabad, Patna, and Bhojpur) have at least one senior officer who is a member of a scheduled caste community. Investigate and prosecute those responsible for attacks on women during the massacres;  Appoint an independent judicial body to investigate the role of the police in conducting raids on villages in the aftermath of massacres, and in illegally destroying or seizing property. Prosecute and punish police responsible for such abuses. Compensate Dalits who have lost property during such raids. The full text of the letter follows.  January 26, 1999 Chief Minister Rabri Devi Patna, Bihar India Dear Chief Minister Rabri Devi,  We write to express our deep concern about the massacre on January 25 of at least twenty-one lower caste men, women and children in the village of Shankarbigha, Jehanabad district, Bihar. As you are aware, the massacre is the latest in a series of such attacks, the fifth of its kind since July 1996, in which lower caste men, women and children were killed by the Ranvir Sena for their suspected allegiance to the Communist Party of India/Marxist-Leninist [CPI(M-L)] or the Maoist Communist Centre, groups that have agitated for radical redistribution of land in the state. The latest attack clearly indicates that the state administration has failed to either curb the activities of this illegal army or to provide protection to the state's poorest lower caste sectors. Human Rights Watch urges the government to break the cycle of violence and state complicity by taking immediate steps to prevent further attacks in Bihar's central districts and to investigate and punish those responsible for the killings, including any officials or members of the police who failed to respond to repeated calls for protection for the villagers or to prosecute previous acts of violence.  According to press reports, members of the Ranvir Sena, a private militia of local upper caste landlords, entered eight thatched huts in the village on the night of January 25 and fired indiscriminately on the occupants. Many of the victims, including several children, were shot in the head and stomach at point-blank range. According to Jehanabad District Magistrate P. Amrit, the killers shouted Ranvir Sena slogans throughout the attacks. The village is only ten kilometers away from Laxmanpur-Bathe, the site of a December 1997 Ranvir Sena massacre that left at least sixty-one lower caste villagers dead. In that incident nearly 250 Ranvir Sena members raided the village in another overnight attack and shot, stabbed, and raped victims waking from their sleep.  Previous attacks have frequently followed rising tensions between landlords and agricultural laborers over agricultural wages, encroachment on land by upper caste farmers, or blockades imposed on village lands by CPI(M-L) members. Investigations conducted by Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups reveal a pattern of police and other official complicity in the violence. In several cases, villagers repeatedly appealed for protection to district officials weeks or even days before the attack took place. Police typically arrived on the scene over twelve hours after the incident. In one case, police officers stationed nearby forced open the villagers' houses and then stood by and watched as the massacre took place. Human Rights Watch has also found that police deployed in massacre-affected areas in the aftermath of killings have conducted raids on Dalit hamlets and have engaged in looting, destruction of property, arbitrary arrests, and attacks on women.  The government should make every effort to ensure that senior officials at the state and local levels issue unambiguous directives that are widely publicized that any civil servant or security officer found to be complicit in Ranvir Sena attacks, or found to take part in arbitrary raids, will be prosecuted. While we are aware that arrests have been carried out in connection with a number of these attacks, we are unaware that any of the sena leaders involved in the attacks have been arrested. If your government is going to stem the violence, it is essential that those organizing the attacks, as well as those carrying them out, be brought to justice and that the activities of this already-banned organization be curtailed.  Human Rights Watch recommends that the state government of Bihar provide full security to villagers against further Ranvir Sena attacks and ensure that police pickets are placed away from upper caste areas to areas more accessible and secure for lower caste communities. Independent commissions of inquiry should also be appointed to investigate and punish those responsible for attacks in affected districts, including any officials or members of the police who failed to respond to repeated calls for protection for villagers or to prosecute previous acts of violence. All districts affected by caste clashes (particularly Jehanabad, Patna, and Bhojpur) should have at least one senior officer who is a member of a scheduled caste community. A special effort should be also be made to investigate and prosecute those responsible for attacks on women during the massacres.  Finally, an independent judicial body should be appointed to investigate the role of the police in conducting raids on villages in the aftermath of massacres, and in illegally destroying or seizing property. Police responsible for such abuses should be prosecuted and punished accordingly. Dalits who have lost property during such raids should be compensated. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to learning more about what your government has done to end the violence. Sincerely, Sidney R.

According to local human rights groups, incidents of violence, including assaults on church workers, nuns and priests, and arson attacks on churches and other property have increased sharply since December 25. In the most recent incident in Orissa, an Australian missionary and his sons were killed when a mob reportedly led by a local leader of the extremist Bajrang Dal group set fire to their van. While we were gratified to see that your government has condemned that incident and other acts of violence and that a number of people have been arrested in connection with the attacks, we are greatly troubled by the fact that the attacks have continued. We are also greatly troubled by allegations that local officials, including police officers, have given tacit support to rallies organized by groups that have fomented the violence. State and local officials have also attempted to downplay the destruction to Christian property, dismissing the burning of churches as attacks on mere """"temporary structures."""" By characterizing the violence as a """"communal clash"""" between local communities, some authorities appear to be suggesting that the attacks were spontaneous eruptions, but there is some evidence to suggest that they have been well-organized under the leadership of extremist Hindu groups. In Gujarat, the Bajrang Dal reportedly threatened local newspaper editors and journalists that they would be """"taught a lesson"""" if they continued to publish reports about the incidents. We are concerned that the communities affected represent some of the poorest in these states and include former Dalits and members of local tribal communities. These recent attacks fall into a pattern of abuse against such marginalized communities. They represent a clear failure on the part of both the central and state governments to take the necessary steps to ensure that such communities enjoy the full protection of their rights.  Despite the ongoing nature of the violence, local police have not provided adequate protection to villagers in the affected areas, even though there have been early warnings about the possibility of violence. According to reports we have received, in some cases police have refused to register complaints by members of the Christian community although they have registered complaints by others against the Christian community. Some who have filed charges with the police have reportedly been pressured to withdraw their complaints. We have also received reports that officers who have taken action in response to the attacks have been threatened with transfers.  While we have not investigated these incidents ourselves and would welcome an opportunity to visit Gujarat and Orissa to gather first-hand information from both sides, the public perception in targeted communities is that elements of the government have been complicit. Your government should make every effort to reverse this perception by ensuring that senior officials at the state and local levels issue unambiguous directives that are widely publicized that any civil servant or security officer found to be complicit in the attacks will be punished and that association of civil servants with groups preaching communal intolerance is strictly prohibited. While we are aware that arrests have been carried out in connection with a number of these attacks, we are unaware that any of the leaders of the groups involved in the attacks has been arrested. If your government is going to stem the violence, it is essential that those organizing the attacks, as well as those carrying them out, be brought to justice. We also urge you to encourage state governments to establish vigilance committees at the local level to monitor and report on incidents of violence and provide a mechanism for affected villagers to register complaints. The powers of the National Commission on Minorities could be expanded to enable it to establish branch offices and legal cells in affected states to investigate incidents and assist affected communities. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to learning more about what your government has done to end the violence. Sincerely, Sidney R.

Enron Power Corporation owns 50 percent of the Dabhol Power Corporation, which employs security forces who routinely beat and harass people demonstrating peacefully against the power plant. The report charges that Dabhol has indirectly benefitted from other repressive government actions aimed at quelling opposition to the plant, which is the largest single foreign investment in India and the largest private power project in the world.? The project is a joint-venture of three U.S. companies -- the Houston-based Enron Corporation which is the principal shareholder and operator; General Electric; and Bechtel -- and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The report documents how Indian authorities have misused Indian law to charge peaceful demonstrators with serious crimes. Meanwhile, the U.S. government and its Export-Import Bank, which have both vigorously promoted Enron’s investment in India, have failed to address the human rights questions that they are obliged to investigate. The report calls on international financial institutions to take human rights into consideration when financing projects. """"Governments have a primary responsibility to make sure that human rights violations don't take place,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But corporations can't look the other way when protesters are being beaten right outside their front gates. Enron has been shirking its responsibility to behave as a decent global citizen.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the corporate and political leaders gathered this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to examine the Enron investment in India as part of their focus this year on """"Responsible Globality."""" The 166-page report is the result of a year-long investigation and provides detailed evidence of the systematic suppression of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as police use of arbitrary detentions and excessive force against opponents of the Enron project. All of these are violations of international laws and treaties that the Indian government has signed. Local opposition to the Enron project began in 1992 over concerns about """"transparency,"""" corruption, and the hasty negotiations over the terms of Enron’s investment. Since then, protests have erupted over local farmers?complaints that the power plant has unfairly acquired their land and has diverted scarce water for its needs. Fishermen have protested over fears that when power generation begins in March 1999, effluents will cause a rise in seawater temperatures and kill off their fish harvests.  In one instance in June 1997, Maharashtra police raided a fishing village where many residents opposed the power plant. They arbitrarily beat and arrested dozens of villagers, including Sadhana Bhalekar, the wife of a well- known protester against the plant. They broke down the door and window of Bhalekar’s bathroom and dragged her naked out into the street, beating her with batons. Bhalekar was three months pregnant at the time. In another instance in May 1997, police beat and arrested nearly 180 protesters who were demonstrating peacefully oustide the company gates. In its investigation, Human Rights Watch documented thirty similar incidents and heard allegations of many more. The Human Rights Watch report also documents how contractors for the Dabhol Power Corporation harassed and attacked individuals opposed to the power plant.?Police refused to investigate complaints, and in several cases, actually arrested the victims on trumped-up charges.?P> Since the project’s inception in 1992, Enron and the government of Maharashtra state have repeatedly ignored public complaints. """"Dabhol Power Corporation would not tolerate any human rights abuses by its employees and sub-contractors,"""" the company said in a 1997 statement. """"If you have concerns about police actions, we suggest that you take it up with the police or government body that is responsible for their operations."""" """"Our report clearly establishes that people who opposed the power plant were subjected to human rights abuses,"""" said Roth. """"Enron’s responsibilities don’t end at the perimeter of its plant premises. Given the size and impact of its facility, the company must address abuses that aim to silence its opposition."""" The Dabhol Power Corporation, under provisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the security they provided to the company.?These forces, located adjacent to the project site, were stationed there largely for the purpose of dealing with protests. While they report to local police, their expenses are paid by the company. The U.S. government bears special responsibility because of its aggressive lobbying on behalf of the three U.S.-based companies developing the project, and because it extended hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds for the project while seemingly indifferent to human rights-related policies that apply to such transactions.?P> Human Rights Watch noted that although the Indian press widely reported the human rights troubles around the power plant, U.S. officials failed to investigate the matter. Enron has received between $290 million and $300 million in U.S. government loan guarantees for its investment in Dabhol. The State Department’s entire assessment for one Export-Import Bank loan read, """"The State Department has no objection to this case on political grounds or on the basis of human rights issues."""" U.S. law requires that such an assessment be carried out before loan guarantees can be extended. The U.S. ambassador to India in the mid-1990's, Frank Wisner, told Human Rights Watch in an interview, """"I have never seen any information on human rights violations related to Dabhol."""" Ambassador Wisner was named to the board of directors of Enron Oil and Gas, a subsidiary of the Enron Corporation, on October 28, 1997, a few months after he left his post in India.","Asia, United States, India","Economic Justice and Rights"

""""Already, 133 countries have signed this treaty, and it’s going to take effect on March 1, 1999 -- faster than any international treaty in history. North Africa needs to get on this band wagon without delay."""" North Africa is a heavily mined region -- with all countries affected by the weapon. Egypt, which claims to suffer from some twenty-three million uncleared landmines, is also the sole remaining antipersonnel mine producer on the continent of Africa. Egyptian manufactured mines are known to have been deployed in countries including Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Somalia. For these reasons, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines has chosen Egypt as the site for its Fifth International NGO Conference in late 1999. Tunisia and Algeria are the only countries in North Africa which have signed the treaty. Human Rights Watch urged them to ratify and implement the treaty as soon as possible. To date sixty countries have ratified the treaty, including Jordan, Qatar and Yemen in the region of the Middle East and North Africa. Wareham urged Tunisia and Algeria to start destruction of their stockpiled antipersonnel landmines, to accelerate their demining programs in order to clear all antipersonnel landmines within ten years, and to provide assistance to landmine survivors. She also called on them to comply with the treaty’s requirement to report on their progress in implementing the treaty.  While some in the Middle East/North Africa region are very hostile to a landmine ban at this time -- including Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Libya, and Syria -- nearly every country has expressed support for a ban at some point in the future. """"The landmine problem is not going away,"""" said Wareham. """"The time to ban antipersonnel mines is right now."""" Human Rights Watch is a member of the 1997 Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines. It is also coordinator of the Landmine Monitor initiative, a global reporting network that reports on implementation of the treaty and on the humanitarian response to the global landmine crisis.

At the summit meeting tomorrow (Saturday), states neighboring Burundi—the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda -- as well as Ethiopia are expected to discuss lifting the blanket trade sanctions that have been in force against Burundi since 1996.  """"The trade sanctions haven't stopped the civil war, and they've imposed a lot of hardship on the population,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But cutting off the arms supply could stem the pervasive human rights abuses that this war has inflicted on so many civilians.""""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/21/letter-julius-nyerere-urging-arms-embargo-burundi","Letter to Julius Nyerere Urging Arms Embargo on Burundi","Letter to Julius Nyerere Urging Arms Embargo on Burundi","","01/21/1999","Human Rights Watch has been actively engaged with the situation in Burundi, having monitored both human rights developments and arms flows to parties to the tragic civil war in that country in the past two years. On the basis of our research, and continuing investigations in the region, we have called repeatedly on the United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Burundi (all sides)— in keeping with our policy of advocating curbs on the flow of weapons to forces, be they governments or non-state actors, that commit gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Although the situation in Burundi appears to have stabilized to some extent and peace negotiations are underway, we remain highly concerned about ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Burundi, as well as about the fact that both sides continue to arm themselves at an alarming pace (despite the regional sanctions against the government of President Pierre Buyoya). We are also concerned about the growing role of Burundian government as well as rebel forces in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We understand that the issue of sanctions will be high on the agenda for the regional summit that is scheduled to be held in Arusha this Saturday, January 23. We also understand that one likely outcome of this meeting is that sanctions on Burundi will be suspended, if not lifted altogether. Were this to happen, I would ask you to impress on the leaders of the states in the region the need to at least maintain an arms embargo on the government of Burundi, and extend such an embargo to the rebels as well. The advantage of an arms embargo over a blanket embargo of goods is that an arms ban is a highly discriminating mechanism that targets only those who are using (or really: mis-using) weapons, not the civilian population. Moreover, while an arms embargo is only as effective as its implementation by the states imposing it, the imposition of a ban on the provision of arms nevertheless sends a powerful message to those who commit gross violations of human rights that they cannot continue to conduct business as usual. Such an embargo should cover both the government of Burundi and the armed rebel movements, as both sides have committed gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch published a report in 1998, Proxy Targets: Civilians in the War in Burundi, which described the pattern of these abuses. A regional arms embargo should be implemented and actively enforced by the regional states imposing it. Leaks in the sanctions in force since 1996 have permitted both sides to continue to arm themselves. Unsurprisingly, aware of states' willingness to close their eyes to these supplies and what would be done with these weapons, both sides have made no effort to cease their attacks on the civilian population, one conveniently blaming the other for each atrocity. Thanks to the inflow of arms and ammunition, the Army has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive. New recruits appear to be well armed with AKM and AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles, and to have plenty of ammunition (last week, all the on-duty soldiers in Bujumbura were seen carrying three clips of ammunition each). To strengthen an embargo regime, we suggest that the regional states monitor the embargo's implementation by placing well-trained security personnel at key transshipment points in their countries and instructing them to carry out inspections of suspect cargo. Moreover, states imposing the embargo should amend their national laws to criminalize embargo violations, and should actively prosecute those who are found to be trafficking in arms to Burundi. Beyond a regional arms embargo, I would also ask you to consider calling on the U.N. Security Council to impose an international arms embargo on all sides in the war, as this would address the problem of arms flights from other regions directly into Bujumbura (i.e., without the involvement of the neighboring states). It is our understanding that members of the Security Council would endorse the idea of an international embargo on both sides in the civil war if regional states were to show strong support for it. Should the Security Council impose an embargo, neighboring states would be in a strong position to request international assistance in monitoring their borders and in obtaining training of customs and police officers. There have been repeated reports of arms transfers to both the Burundian government and rebel forces in the past year. For example: In February 1998, a cargo plane flying from Burgas in Bulgaria to Bujumbura was grounded in Lagos, Nigeria, as it was attempting to refuel. Finding arms aboard, Nigerian authorities briefly detained the plane's crew, as well as a Burundian military officer, Alfred Nkurunziza, then a key aide to President Buyoya and currently Burundi's minister of defense. This particular flight was but one of many arms flights to Bujumbura in the past year. Lake Tanganyika was reported to be the main route for arms traffickers supplying Burundian rebel forces in 1998. Many of these weapons originate in South Africa and are transferred to the rebels via Zambia or eastern Congo. The International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda) charged by the U.N. Security Council with investigating arms trafficking in the Great Lakes region, drew attention to this business in two reports in 1998, as the Burundian rebels' alliance with rebels from Rwanda had, in the commission's view, significantly weakened the international arms embargo in force against the latter.  Human Rights Watch also continues to receive reports of serious violations of human rights in Burundi:  Both parties to the conflict continue to target civilians, several hundred of whom have been killed in the last few months. In addition, despite the repeated assurances by the government of Burundi that camps for the displaced would be disbanded, tens of thousands continue to be held against their will in such facilities. Such reports on recent human rights violations and arms supplies underscore the urgency of the need for an arms ban. In closing, therefore, I urge you to consider calling on the neighboring states to impose an arms embargo against both the Burundian government and rebel forces. Only a strong message of that nature can put an end to the culture of impunity that has characterized the civil war while shielding the civilian population from the deleterious effect of wider sanctions.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/21/china-time-go-back-geneva","China- Time to go back to Geneva","China: Time to go back to Geneva","","01/21/1999","Human Rights Watch today urged the international community to back a resolution condemning China's human rights practices at the next session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, from March 22-April 30, 1999. The drafting and lobbying for a resolution should begin immediately. """"Last year, the key countries that have sponsored such a resolution since 1990 opted instead for 'dialogue' with China, saying a 'non-confrontational' approach would be more effective,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"But today China is carrying out one of the worst crackdowns against political dissent since 1989. The time for silence is over."""" Some of the governments that decided not to sponsor a resolution last year cited the fact that in the last six years, no resolution against China had actually been passed, though in 1995 a measure failed by a single vote. Others cited the lack of consensus about the value of a resolution. And virtually all cited commitments China had made in exchange for dropping the annual effort at a resolution, including promises to sign key international human rights treaties and to welcome a visit to China by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson. Jones said none of those arguments held up. """"Past failures to adopt a resolution were largely due to a lack of political will by the sponsors, who did not devote as much time and resources to getting a resolution passed as China spent getting it defeated."""" She also pointed out that under the pressure of the Geneva discussion, Beijing took limited steps such as agreeing to visits by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (in 1997) and U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance (in 1994), but stopped short of implementing their recommendations for specific reforms. """"The decision on whether or not to criticize China in the U.N.'s most important human rights body should be based on principle, not on a calculated assessment of a motion's success,"""" said Jones. Human Rights Watch said it was time to revisit the statements made last year when governments decided to abandon public criticism of China at the Human Rights Commission. Both the European Union (E.U.) and the U.S. set benchmarks for what China would have to do to avoid a resolution, but curiously, the benchmarks did not include refraining from committing new abuses. The E.U.'s conditions included a visit to China by Mary Robinson, resumption of visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to Chinese prisons, release of """"a number"""" of dissidents, signing and submitting for ratification the two key human rights covenants and E.U. visits to Tibet. The American conditions were release of political prisoners with medical problems, signing and submitting for ratification the two key human rights covenants, and resuming discussions with the ICRC on prison visits. The visit to Tibet of ambassadors from the E.U. troika countries took place in May 1998 but was marred by reports of at least ten deaths, vicious beatings, and prolonged solitary confinement for prisoners who tried to hold a protest at Tibet's main prison. Mary Robinson's visit took place in September 1998, but Chinese officials produced none of the information she requested on prisoners, denied her access to the Panchen Lama, and made no specific commitments on ratification of two U.N. human rights treaties. China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in October 1998 but has produced no timetable for ratifying it. It has also indicated to diplomats that it intends to attach reservations, or exceptions, on key provisions, such as Article 19 guaranteeing the right to free expression. No progress was made on ICRC visits to prisons. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has continued to arrest and punish anyone it sees as threatening to its one-party system, clearly violating both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR. At least one hundred members of the Chinese Democracy Party have been detained since July 1998, and three have received harsh sentences of eleven to thirteen years in prison. Other are awaiting trial. Lin Hai, a software engineer, was put on trial in Shanghai in December 1998 for distributing Chinese e-mail addresses to a pro-democracy group in Washington; he was given a two-year sentence on January 20. A labor rights and democracy activist, Zhang Shanguang, was given a ten-year sentence for providing Radio Free Asia information about peasant protests. A poet and writer, Ma Zhe, was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of subversion for publishing an independent literary journal. In addition, strict new regulations were adopted on formation of non-governmental political and social organizations in October 1998. Chinese officials warned film directors, computer software developers, writers and artists, the media, and the publishing industry that if they endangered """"social order"""" or tried to """"overthrow state power"""" they could be imprisoned for life. In light of these developments, it is difficult for governments to continue to claim that dialogues are more effective than criticism in addressing human rights issues. Among the countries that abandoned Geneva in favor of carrying out """"dialogues"""" were Canada, Australia, Japan, the U.S. and the European Union. In February 1998, the E.U. foreign ministers issued a statement just weeks before the first E.U.-China summit in London. They said, """"In view of the encouraging results in the E.U.-China human rights dialogue, neither the E.U. presidency nor member states should table or co-sponsor a draft resolution at the next U.N. Commission on Human Rights."""" At the same time, the British government, then in the E.U. presidency, qualified this decision by leaving the door open to future support for a Geneva effort. British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said, """"We have therefore resolved on a new approach in which we are going to put our priority and pressure on human rights in China through dialogue with China...Any decision that we reach this year in relation to the Commission on Human Rights does not necessarily bind us next year. Whether or not we table a resolution at next year's Commission on Human Rights will depend upon China showing that it is willing to enter into the dialogue in good faith and produce results."""" Other countries moved away from sponsoring a resolution, some even earlier than the E.U. Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said in April 1997, """"The government has decided in light of the significant weakening of consensus of the resolution among its traditional co-sponsors that it no longer carries the weight it has in past years...We are optimistic that this [package of bilateral cooperative programs on human rights] will lead to other opportunities for us to influence change in China's human rights practices. Rather than co-sponsor the resolution, we would pursue more effective means to influence Chinese respect for the human rights of its citizens."""" Australia's Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, also declared in April 1997, """"China has agreed to establish a formal and regular bilateral dialogue on human rights... While there will inevitably be differences between Australia and China on human rights issues, a formal bilateral dialogue will provide a framework for dealing with such differences and for pursuing concrete improvements in the observance of internationally recognized human rights standards in China."""" Noting that a resolution on China had never passed, he added, """"If that sort of diplomacy is not going to be effective, well, you have got to think through what could be effective."""" In the U.S., a State Department spokesman announced the U.S. decision to abandon a Geneva resolution in March 1998, about the same time that the administration disclosed that President Clinton's trip to China would be moved up from November to June: """"We have taken note of a number of positive developments in the human rights situation in China...While we by no means consider [China's promise to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the release of several dissidents] sufficient -- nor do we consider the human rights situation in China to be satisfactory -- we have determined that there are other, more promising ways to pursue improving the human rights situation."""" In Germany, then Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said in March 1998: """"I welcome the fact that China is now a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and also its announced intention to sign the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those are hopeful signs, holding out a prospect of further urgently needed progress in enhancing respect for human rights in China. This is a goal to which we remain committed. Countries that think they can ignore their obligations under international human rights conventions are on quite the wrong track."""" In recent weeks, pressure has been building within several countries to suspend bilateral dialogues and begin preparing a resolution for debate in Geneva. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons adopted a series of recommendations on December 21, 1998. It noted that """"very grave and widespread abuses of human rights continue in China, not least in Tibet"""" and called on the British government to give """"serious consideration to supporting the renewal of the previous human rights resolution in relation to China at subsequent sessions of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."""" The European Parliament has repeatedly called on the E.U. to support a China motion in Geneva. Sixty members of the U.S. Congress wrote to President Bill Clinton on December 10, 1998, urging him to """"make a renewed, vigorous effort to urge China to comply with its international human rights obligations"""" and to """"inform Chinese officials that the U.S. will press for reintroduction and adoption of a resolution on China at next spring's U.N. Commission meeting..."""" In his reply on January 5, Clinton wrote that """"I am not optimistic that such a resolution would garner sufficient support in the international community to be an effective tool...We will approach the Commission meeting with an open mind, however, and look for the most effective ways to highlight human rights abuses in China."""" The human rights situation in China has clearly deteriorated; a return to Geneva would be a fitting response.","Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"

Jones said that Human Rights Watch hoped to see a public statement on the Lin Hai case from industry giants like Microsoft.

The Kurdish leader, who has been in Italy since mid-November, was allowed to flee the country this past weekend on the eve of a court decision on whether Italy would prosecute him. His whereabouts are currently unknown.   """"The Italian government in particular, but also the international community as a whole, has in this case missed an important opportunity to signal that those who commit atrocities will be held accountable,"""" stated Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The case underscores the need to operationalize the commitments made by Italy and other countries to a system of international criminal justice: they need to enact legislation enabling them to prosecute crimes of universal jurisdiction, such as crimes against humanity. And, though it could not have been a forum for adjudication of this case, they need to ratify the treaty creating an international criminal court, so that future gross violations can be adjudicated outside of the political realm where this case was resolved.""""     Ocalan is wanted in Turkey on terrorism charges related to the fourteen-year conflict that his PKK has waged against Turkish government forces. Italy declined to extradite Ocalan to Turkey on the grounds that he might face the death penalty there. Upon Ocalan's departure from Italy, decisions by the Italian authorities were still pending on both his request for political asylum in Italy and a possible Italian charge of terrorism against him. In repeated recent public statements, apparently concerned that an Ocalan trial would be politically unpopular, particularly with western Europe's large Kurdish population, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema encouraged Ocalan to leave the country. Italian authorities expressed relief upon Ocalan's departure.     In a November letter to Prime Minister D'Alema, Human Rights Watch praised the decision not to send Ocalan to Turkey to stand trial, where the rights group warned against a substantial risk he would face torture, as well as the possibility of the death penalty. At the same time, Human Rights Watch pressed Italy to hold Ocalan accountable for crimes against humanity committed under his command, or to send him to another country that would undertake the prosecution in accordance with international law.     Human Rights Watch's letter to D'Alema recounted that between 1992 and 1995, the height of the conflict, Ocalan's PKK is believed to have been responsible for at least 768 extrajudicial executions, mostly of civil servants and teachers, political opponents, off-duty police officers and soldiers, and those deemed by the PKK to be """"state supporters."""" In addition, the PKK committed numerous large-scale massacres of civilians, usually against villagers or villages that were believed to be connected with the state civil defense """"village guard system."""" In twenty-five such massacres committed between 1992 and 1995, 360 people were killed, including thirty-nine women and seventy-six children. These actions were not committed by rogue units or commanders, but were PKK official policy.     Human Rights Watch has often reported and condemned abuses committed by Turkish government forces, as well as the PKK. """"We have repeatedly demanded that the Turkish government investigate and hold accountable those members of its security forces responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed against the Kurds, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate fire,"""" Cartner explained.

The Council of Europe's review of Armenia's membership application should yield substantial reforms, yet our recent findings that show that the government is falling well below the standards expected for membership. We believe that the widespread pattern of violations that we found in Armenia -- combined with the climate of impunity for their perpetrators -- is indicative of the government's lack of commitment to the rule of law.   I write to express our alarm regarding the results of a recent assessment carried out by Human Rights Watch investigators into human rights practices in Armenia. The Council of Europe's review of Armenia's membership application should yield substantial reforms, yet our recent findings that show that the government is falling well below the standards expected for membership. We believe that the widespread pattern of violations that we found in Armenia -- combined with the climate of impunity for their perpetrators -- is indicative of the government's lack of commitment to the rule of law. Our concerns include:  Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army that has led to numerous deaths;  police abuse of detainees in pretrial detention; legislation that codifies violations of freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance; arbitrary detention of journalists and harassment of the media; and  the failure to prosecute incidents of election-related violence and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. Given our recent findings, we believe that Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe would be premature until such time as the government takes concrete and significant steps to improve human rights practices, and we urge no further progress on its application to give the government sufficient time to address the concerns detailed below and to demonstrate that it is fully committed to improving human rights protections both in law and in practice. Two Human Rights Watch representatives will be in Strasbourg during the January parliamentary assembly session and will be contacting you separately to arrange a meeting to discuss our findings in greater detail. Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army. During a recent in-depth investigation into conditions in the Armenian army, Human Rights Watch found that throughout the past three years officers and conscripts have been responsible for beating, torturing, and shooting to death new conscripts. We found a persistent pattern by military procuracy investigators of declaring many such peacetime deaths as suicides or accidental deaths despite significant evidence -- both forensic and photographic -- that the deaths were murders. Senior defense ministry personnel are highly reluctant to hold senior unit officers accountable for such deaths; in some cases, junior officers have been prosecuted, but the convicted officers were frequently released by amnesty shortly after sentencing. Armenian nongovernmental organizations estimate that approximately 200 conscripts died annually in 1996, 1997, and 1998, despite the cease-fire governing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict signed in May 1994. Human Rights Watch considers this estimate credible, and believes that actual figures are very likely to be higher. Some of these deaths are a result of ongoing hostilities in the conflict zone; however, the numerous deaths throughout the past three years in units away from the conflict zone, and deaths ruled suicides in units in the conflict zone, indicate a pattern of persistent human rights violations for which authorities are unwilling to hold officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense's policy of declaring statistics on peacetime deaths a military secret, and of instructing journalists not to identify units where deaths have occurred in published reports, has contributed to a climate of impunity for officers responsible for abuse in their units. Further, Defense Ministry officials' refusal to make the code of conduct for military personnel available to the public contributes to lack of discipline in units, fosters a climate of lawlessness in which abuses take place, and hinders judges, investigators, and lawyers from holding officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense has refused requests from nongovernmental organizations, defense lawyers, and others concerned with conditions in the army to make public this document. We are particularly alarmed by this development because the code, which details appropriate conduct for military personnel, disciplinary infractions and punishments, and due process during investigations, was readily available to those serving in the Soviet Army in almost all military units and even in most public libraries. As such, we view this lack of transparency as indicative of the government's lack of commitment to guaranteeing a fundamental element of rule of law citizens' access to the laws that govern them. Conscripts interviewed during the course of our investigation stated that physical abuse and beatings of new conscripts in the Armenian army is systematic and widespread by officers and by older conscripts. One twenty-year-old Armenian citizen who recently completed military service in Martakert military unit 49971, inside the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast, told Human Rights Watch that physical abuse by officers is rampant even for such minor offenses as being late to meals, failure to salute an officer, and talking during sleeping hours. For instance, he described witnessing an officer beating a fellow conscript in this unit so severely for failing to salute that the conscript's arm was broken. In addition, this former conscript and numerous other conscripts stated that officers routinely ignore severe beatings of new conscripts by older soldiers, and that new inductees are frequently pressured and physically abused by older conscripts and officers to compel them to perform humiliating tasks and to extort money and personal belongings from them. No conscript or family member interviewed by Human Rights Watch expressed confidence that complaints about such abuses to officers would be investigated and acted upon, and in many cases, expressed great fear that complaints would merely lead to further abuse. In unit 59015, located in Zod, Vardenis province, officers have been alleged to have been engaged in systematized theft of conscripts' belongings and packages from home, and family members stated that one junior officer was beaten to death for allegedly refusing to participate in the scheme. Following the man's death, family members told Human Rights Watch that they became aware of ten subsequent deaths in the unit throughout a period of two and a half years. During this period, the family repeatedly sought the assistance of senior Defense Ministry staff, the military procuracy and the president to sanction officers in the unit, to no avail. Officials' persistent failure to act on the family's complaints in this case illustrates the government's unwillingness to act to curb abuses, and contributed to a climate in which the subsequent deaths in the unit occurred. Two officers from the unit are now awaiting trial in Yerevan for murder and participation in the scheme, but to our knowledge the unit's senior commander has not been disciplined or sanctioned for failing to investigate the family's complaints and implementing measures to alter the abusive conditions in the unit. Another family told Human Rights Watch that they received a letter in November 1997, requesting that they send money to their son, a conscript serving in military unit 34153 in Askeron, Nagorno Karabakh. Family members reported that in a separate note accompanying the letter, the draftee indicated that he had been compelled to make the request and that the family should not send money. This conscript's death in the unit was ruled a suicide on January 3, 1998, despite evidence on his body of a severe beating. Human Rights Watch is aware of five other deaths ruled as suicides or accidental deaths in this unit, including the death on April 7, 1998, of Vahagan Alaveridian, an eighteen-year-old resident of Yerevan drafted in November 1997. Mr. Alaverdian's family reported that after Armenian military officials called them to Hojaly military hospital in Nagorno Karabakh, they identified the body of their son covered in extensive bruises on the chest, stomach, and back, and they alleged that officers and other members of the military unit in which he served were responsible for beating him to death. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has serious concerns regarding conditions in places of detention under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, including stockades in military units and military police holding cells. One twenty-four-year-old former detainee who declared himself a conscientious objector told Human Rights Watch that in December 1996, he was detained at his Yerevan home by conscription commission officials, and forcibly conscripted into military unit 27229 in Noyamberian, despite his statements that he was unable to do military service for religious reasons. He reported that he was then taken from the Noyamberian military unit to the Echivan military police department, where he was held in a weapons storage room of approximately two-by-three meters in size for two and a half months along with eleven other detainees, from January to mid-March 1997. He reported that this room had no toilet, and that guards frequently denied requests to use bathroom facilities. During his entire stay in this facility, he was not allowed to bathe, and had only infrequent access to drinking and washing water. He further reported that food was provided only intermittently at two to three day intervals, usually by soldiers who themselves served at the facility and shared their rations with detainees. We consider such treatment to be cruel, inhuman, and degrading, and as such in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 19 of Armenia's Constitution. Draftees who had declared themselves conscientious objectors on religious grounds told Human Rights Watch that they and their family members are routinely subject to harassment and even physical abuse by police, district and regional conscription commission officials, and other Ministry of Defense personnel. We note that due to the lack of an alternative to military service, Amnesty International has designated a number of prisoners currently serving for refusal to perform military service on religious grounds as prisoners of conscious. For several years, we have received alarming reports that Ministry of Defense personnel arbitrarily detain and hold hostage family members of draftees who fail to report for callups. Notably, this practice was cited in the U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997. For example, one draftee told Human Rights Watch that in July 1997, Yerevan conscription commission officials detained his mother, took her to a military unit attached to the Ministry of Defense's headquarters on Ashtarag highway, and held her for four days in an attempt to coerce her son into reporting for military duty. The draftee's wife and mother-in-law told Human Rights Watch that they were detained and held hostage in the same military unit for one day, and were freed only after repeated reminders to the unit's officers that at the time of their detention they had not been allowed to place their minor children in an adult's care and that they were at home without supervision. Reports of widespread physical abuse of detainees -- including children -- in pre-trial detention We are alarmed by reports of rampant physical abuse in pretrial detention facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security and by the failure to prosecute those responsible for it. For instance, police officials of the Massis district police station and Yerevan Investigative Isolator No. 1 reportedly severely beat Hamlet Heloyan, after his arrest in March 1998, in an effort to coerce him into signing a confession regarding his participation in a series of thefts. Reports of systematic beatings of detainees in other facilities include a former detainee of the Gumri Investigative Isolator who told Human Rights Watch that on June 1, 1996, he witnessed the arrival from Yerevan of Ministry of Internal Affairs Criminal Investigative Department staff, who proceeded to summarily pull detainees from their cells and severely beat them over a period of several hours. He reported that the beatings were in retaliation for the previous escape of two prisoners from the facility. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has received numerous allegations that police officials at the Yerevan Main City Police Department routinely beat children at the facility who are detained for petty crimes. For example, one seventeen-year-old boy interviewed by a Human Rights Watch investigator stated that in November 1997, he was detained by Yerevan city police officers, taken to the Yerevan Main City Police Department, and severely and systematically beaten for several hours, after which his head was repeatedly forced into a bucket of water in an attempt to coerce him into signing testimony against others. He stated that five police officials systematically carried out the beating, including Nelly Duriyan, the head of the Yerevan Main City Police Department's unit for children. Human Rights Watch investigator found highly credible allegations that children detained in other facilities in the Yerevan metropolitan area, including in Nornok and Erebuni police station, have been beaten by police. The procurator's office has shown an insufficient commitment to impartially investigating and prosecuting cases of physical abuse, which has contributed to the climate of impunity for police abuse in Armenia. Despite three meetings between procuracy officials and Human Rights Watch representatives, and a written request, Deputy Procurator General Haratiyan, whose responsibilities include oversight of the police, failed to provide information regarding the prosecution of abusive police officials. This lack of transparency contributes to the widespread lack of public confidence in the procuracy and the police in Armenia. We are particularly alarmed about this situation because of the great reluctance that victims of torture in Armenia have expressed to Human Rights Watch to make complaints to officials, and view it as fostering the current climate in which witnesses and victims greatly fear retaliation and retribution. To the best of our knowledge, very few complaints against the police have been prosecuted, and in such cases the police have been charged under articles of the criminal code that are vague and not appropriate to the seriousness of the crimes, such as abuse of office. In one case we are aware of in which police officials have been tried for deaths in police custody, these officials have been tried under articles that have allowed the officials to be freed by amnesty after serving limited sentences. In June 1998, a Yerevan court sentenced four policemen from the third and fourth precincts in Gumri to eight years of imprisonment for the August 12, 1997, death in custody of Galust Dilanian. Police were convicted on charges of abuse of office and assisting in a suicide, even though photographic evidence showed extensive evidence of severe beatings on the victim's body. On October 8, 1998, a Vanadzor court freed one of the police officers, Rafik Gaboyan, by amnesty. Given the very serious nature of the complaints about facilities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, we are concerned about the ministry's lack of willingness to transfer both pretrial and post-conviction facilities to the Ministry of Justice's authority, and about the ministry's failure to cooperate with nongovernmental organizations that seek to monitor pretrial and post-conviction facilities. For example, on February 6, 1998, Mikael Danielian, chairman of the Helsinki Association of Armenia, submitted a request to be allowed access into pretrial and post-conviction facilities to monitor conditions. To date, the ministry has not responded to this request. Restrictions on freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance. In September 1997, the National Assembly adopted an amendment to Armenia's law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations that infringes on freedom of religion in Armenia, and fosters government-sponsored religious intolerance. The 1997 amendment prohibits financing for religions with spiritual centers outside the country, which broadly impacts most religions, including the Roman Catholic Church, and increased the number of members required for registration of a religious organization from fifty to 200. The law as it was originally adopted in 1991 precludes proselytizing by religions other than the official Armenian Orthodox Church. The law, and the amendment passed in 1997, violate freedom of religion, and are incompatible with Armenia's obligations under Article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees individuals the right """"...to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religious or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching."""" The government's treatment of the Jehovah's Witness organization illustrates how freedom of religion continues to be violated in law as well as in practice in Armenia. On May 22, 1998, the Jehovah's Witness organization applied for registration and subsequently received a verbal rejection from the staff of the State Committee for Religious Affairs. Only after repeated appeals did members of the Jehovah's Witnesses receive a written rejection letter on July 17, 1998. Following the committee's refusal to register the organization in May, the organization appealed to the presidential commission on human rights to issue an unequivocal statement in support of the organization's registration. Rather than issue such a statement, on July 8, 1998, the presidential commission issued an opinion that the matter of the organization's registration should be dealt with in the courts. At present, Armenia has lagged in completing reform of its court system, and the judiciary remains heavily under the influence of the executive. As such, we view the presidential commission's ruling as a dismaying indication of the government's lack of commitment to defending basic human rights even when clear violations are brought to its attention. After the presidential human rights commission's action on July 8, 1998, a smear campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses began in Armenia's official newspapers that included statements by officials of the Armenian government and of the Armenian Orthodox Church. The statements cited below help create a climate of hostility toward adherents to this faith: If the case would ever be submitted to court investigation, there would be a large public outcry. Hundreds of people, who have been victims of this sect, separated families -- children affected by its teaching -- would act as public prosecutors....Let them apply to the court, its their constitutional right. -- Lazar Sujyan, chairman of the State Committee of Religious Affairs, on July 15, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper, in an interview regarding the State Committee's decision to deny registration to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The spread of the Jehovah's Witness ideology is a serious threat to the nation, state and religion. First, they prohibit their adherents to touch a gun, that is, to defend the homeland, life, liberty and religion and thus destroy the foundations of our state. Second, there are multiple suicides among the members of the sect -- students -- twelve years old, hung themselves. Both were from Sunik region. There are cases reported in which women reject keeping their households and bearing children or implementing their nuptial duties. Thus, wives practically disavow the oath given to their future husband when marrying, be it at the civil affairs register or at the church. It naturally leads to the destruction of the family, and thus the nation and the state. -- Bishop Parghev Martirossiyan of the Armenia Apostolic Church, on July 18, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper. Statements such as these, which are indicative of the government's deep hostility to nontraditional religious faiths, preceeded a series of violent attacks on religious minorities in April 1995. The U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1995 states that members of twelve non-apostolic religious organizations were subject to attacks by paramilitary troops whose actions were reportedly cleared by high-level government officials. It adds, """"Services were broken up by paramilitary troops wielding iron pipes and guns, pastors and adherents were beaten and kidnaped, and offices were ransacked and equipment stolen. Several victims were rushed to the hospital. About twenty adherents were held for several days or weeks at a military police facility before being released. When asked why they were being held, the commandant told the detainees that it was because of their religious beliefs. The attacks were tacitly abetted by months of articles critical of the groups in both the official and nonofficial press."""" Eyewitnesses with whom Human Rights Watch spoke stated that immediately after the 1995 attacks they were detained and brought to the Ministry of Defense military police headquarters in Yerevan for a period of ten days to two weeks. Adherents to the Jehovah's Witness told Human Rights Watch that members of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Yerkrapah Battalion, a militia group of Nagorno Karabakh veterans headed by Defense Minister Vasgen Sarkisyan carried out the attacks. We are seriously alarmed that throughout the past three years the government of Armenia has refused to bring to justice any of the perpetrators of these attacks. We consider continued impunity for members of the security forces and the Yerkrapah for the attacks to be particularly troubling as we have received highly credible reports that the Yerkrapah organization has subsequently been responsible for other attacks such as the ransacking of a human rights center library in Vanadzor on July 29, 1997. Arbitrary detention and harassment of journalists We are concerned that the government officials' arbitrary detention and other incidents of harassment of journalists -- coupled with a lack of transparency in formulation of policy affecting the media -- has stifled freedom of the press in Armenia and contributes to a climate of self-censorship. For instance, on September 23, 1998, police detained staff of the Hrazdan Television Company, an independent television station located outside of Yerevan, as they were filming footage of newly installed traffic lights for a news broadcast. Police officials reportedly told the staff of the television company that only with the written consent of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security did journalists have the right to broadcast information regarding police activities in Hrazdan. Journalists were detained for five hours, during which time Kotaik province police chief ArmenYeritziyan allegedly threatened the director of the television station in an effort to discourage him from broadcasting information regarding the incident. Journalists told Human Rights Watch that there is an unofficial list of taboo subjects on which the government does not allow reporting, thus choking off public debate on vital issues that have a significant impact on citizens' lives. Journalists stated that subjects the government deems too sensitive for public discussion include the routine conscription of Armenian citizens and refugees into the Armenian army with subsequent forced service in the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast and surrounding areas in Azerbaijan; and corruption and human rights violations by both Republic of Armenia security forces and security forces answerable to the Nagorno Karabakh authorities. Reporters noted that reporting on these subjects was likely to provoke harassing visits and summons for questioning from personnel from the Ministries of Defense and Internal Affairs and National Security. We note that the government has failed to prosecute past incidents of retaliation against journalists by government officials, including beatings and arbitrary detentions, which has contributed to self-censorship and has had a stifling effect on the Armenian media. Other factors contribute to self-censorship in Armenia. Ownership of Periodika and Hymamul, the sole newspaper printing press in the country and the largest distribution service that owns major newspaper street sales outlets in Yerevan, remains in government hands. The government's refusal to divest ownership of these entities gives officials the potential to shut or pressure newspapers who are deemed too critical of the government. We are also concerned that the Ministry of Communication hinders the activities of independent television stations through its failure to develop transparent licencing regulations, and by the widespread reports that the personnel of the ministry frequently solicits bribes from independent television station personnel during the licencing process and during inspections. We note that the Ministry of Communication's Committee for Review of Licence Applications does not meet in open session or hold public hearings, the ministry's Armenia Radio and Television Center has not published technical standards and fee schedules for broadcasting equipment, and that the ministry's National Inspectorate for Broadcasting and Measurement has no published standards for conducting inspections. For the past seven years this lack of written policies and transparency has had a stifling effect on the development of a vigorous, independent broadcast media in Armenia, and has allowed government officials to arbitrarily exert pressure on stations should it deem them overly critical of government officials or policy. Failure to investigate and prosecute violent incidents and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. The OSCE's international election observer mission final report on the March 16, 1998 and March 30, 1998 rounds of the presidential election concluded that the election did not meet international standards, and that observers witnessed ballot stuffing, discrepancies in the vote counts, a large presence of unauthorized persons in polling stations, and instances of intimidation directed at voters, election commission members, candidate proxies and even the international observers themselves. This marked the third consecutive national election in as many years marred by serious irregularities. Human Rights Watch has received numerous credible allegations that organized groups participated in ballot stuffing and violence during the first and second rounds of the Armenian presidential elections on March 16, 1998 and March 31, 1998. Reports include Yerevan precinct 1-5, where a group of approximately thirty men in dark civilian clothing entered the polling station on March 16 and beat two candidate proxies who had protested the group's attempts to tamper with the ballot box. The procuracy and police have failed to investigate and prosecute those responsible, despite published reports regarding the incident and numerous witnesses on the scene. We note that procuracy officials told Human Rights Watch on November 26 that of the forty complaints they investigated, only in four cases have perpetrators of election-related violations been held accountable. But the OSCE election observer mission report provides detailed documentation of widespread violations at the precinct and community electoral commission level that have not been prosecuted. They include ballot stuffing in Yerevan precinct 4-8, fabricated signature counts in Yerevan precinct 3-24, coupon stuffing in Yerevan precincts 8-30 and 8-16, and vote count irregularities in Yerevan precincts 1-6, 8-14, 11-38, and Lori precinct 1-5. The developments outlined above cause serious alarm. We are particularly concerned by our findings that many of the abuses cited above appeared to be fostered by a deliberate systematic restriction on public access to laws and administrative decisions, and by lack of transparency in the process of formulating laws and administrative rulemaking. We view this lack of transparency as directly contributing to poor human rights practices in Armenia and to the widespread distrust in public institutions and lack of public confidence in the parliament, procuracy, police, army, and courts expressed to us by numerous victims of human rights abuses. A cornerstone of the rule of law is that citizens who are expected to abide by laws and regulations should have access to them -- and our findings indicate that in many cases there appeared to be a deliberate attempt on the part of the government to restrict access. For these reasons, we believe the government of Armenia is currently not sufficiently committed to reform and rule of law to merit consideration for full membership in the Council of Europe, and we urge the Parliamentary Assembly to take no further action on its consideration of Armenia's application until such time as the concerns outlined above are addressed. We therefore urge the goernment of Armenia to adopt the following recommendations: reopen investigations of all deaths that the military procuracy has ruled as suicides or accidental deaths where significant evidence exists that murders have occurred;  promptly make public full statistics on deaths in military units and the results of investigations into such deaths carried out by the military police, military procuracy and Ministry of Defense's office for control and inspection; promptly and fully investigate all credible allegations of physical abuse and prosecute all officers and soldiers found responsible; publish all laws, administrative rulings and codes of conduct that govern infractions by conscripts, officers and other Ministry of Defense personnel and that govern conditions and grounds for detention in Ministry of Defense holding facilities and disciplinary battalions; adopt and implement a law on alternative military service; carry out prompt and impartial investigations of all allegations of torture and physical abuse of detainees in the custody of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, make publically available the results of such investigations, and prosecute those officials found responsible; establish a system of independent inspection of all places of detention, including those under the authority of the Ministry of Defense; allow regular and routine access to places of detention to Armenian nongovernmental organizations involved in monitoring and humanitarian assistance to pretrial detainees and prisoners; cease prosecuting police accused of torture on charges of abuse of office; publish statistics on complaints against abusive police officers, the results of investigations into complaints, and prosecution of such cases, including the nature of the charges and lengths of sentences; transfer all pretrial and post-conviction facilities such as closed prisons and labor colonies to the authority of the Ministry of Justice; repeal all provisions of the 1991 law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations, including the 1997 amendment to the law, that are incompatible with international standards;  promptly register religious organizations on a nondiscriminatory basis and desist from harassing members of religious minority groups;  investigate and prosecute instances of harassment of religious minorities by police and other government officials; divest ownership of the Periodika printing facilities and Hymamul newspaper distribution system; and  hold meetings of the Ministry of Communication's licencing review committee in open sessions, adopt transparent rules for applicants seeking television broadcast licences, publish fee scales and inspection standards, and investigate all allegations that Ministry of Communication staff extort bribes from those seeking broadcast licences. I look forward to your response regarding these serious concerns, and to further dialogue with you and members of the Parliamentary Assembly regarding human rights practices in Armenia.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/19/hrw-letter-special-rapporteurs/azerbaijan","HRW - Letter to Special Rapporteurs - Azerbaijan","HRW - Letter to Special Rapporteurs / Azerbaijan","","01/19/1999","In a June 10, 1998 letter to you, Human Rights Watch recommended that no further progress be made in consideration of Azerbaijan's membership application to the Council of Europe until such time as the government achieved measurable progress in adopting urgently needed reform. We continue to be deeply alarmed by developments throughout the year, and believe Azerbaijan's admission to the Council of Europe would be highly premature due to the government's failure to comply with many of its human rights obligations.   In a June 10, 1998 letter to you, Human Rights Watch recommended that no further progress be made in consideration of Azerbaijan's membership application to the Council of Europe until such time as the government achieved measurable progress in adopting urgently needed reform. We continue to be deeply alarmed by developments throughout the year, and believe Azerbaijan's admission to the Council of Europe would be highly premature due to the government's failure to comply with many of its human rights obligations. We are especially distressed that the accession review period, which should have prompted substantial reforms, has in fact witnessed a deterioration in human rights practices in many important areas. Significantly, the 1998 presidential election campaign was characterized by attempts to stifle the legal exercise of electoral rights, by police brutality against public demonstrators and physical abuse in custody after their detention, and by harassment of and attempts to stifle the print and broadcast media. Following the October 11 presidential elections, the police continued to physically abuse demonstrators, and government officials turned to the courts -- which enjoy no independence from the executive -- to squelch freedom of the press through a wave of criminal and civil defamation suits against journalists and newspapers. We note that many of the protests and public demonstrations were in part related to the widespread irregularities that occurred during the elections, which, according to election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, did not meet international standards. Throughout the year the Ministry of Justice's violations of freedom of association and the arbitrary application of registration laws governing nongovernmental organizations and other associations hindered the development of civil society. Moreover, delays in implementing judicial reform and reports of widespread corruption in the criminal justice system raise concerns that the government is not committed to the establishment of a legal system that fairly and impartially adjudicates disputes and administers justice. The past year has seen several signs that the Azerbaijani government is concerned about human rights issues generally. A February 1998 presidential decree, for example, urged greater awareness about human rights among government officials, called for proposals to strengthen free speech protections, and called for greater cooperation with nongovernmental organizations. Later presidential decrees effected a moratorium on the death penalty and repealed prepublication censorship. President Heydar Aliyev has spoken out publicly against using """"illegal means"""" against suspects in police custody. We welcome these decrees, but believe they can be no substitute for marked improvements in practice and a demonstrated commitment to institutional reform. Sadly, as this letter and our previous correspondence demonstrates, these benchmarks have not been met. Human Rights Watch representatives will be in Strasbourg during the January Parliamentary Assembly session and will be contacting you separately to arrange a time to discuss these findings in greater detail. The following is a summary of our concerns in Azerbaijan throughout the past year: Physical Abuse and Torture in Police Custody Police routinely beat and physically abuse detainees in Azerbaijan, and sometimes torture them systematically, according to an in-depth Human Rights Watch investigation into allegations of torture in police custody in November 1997. Our investigation found that physical abuse is widespread and routine for both those detained under suspicion of criminal and political or security offenses in Azerbaijan. We found cases of physical abuse so severe that they resulted in the deaths of detainees while in police custody or in months of hospitalization subsequent to detention. We base those findings on numerous credible allegations of systematized torture in the Baku City Police Department, in the holding facility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Directorate to Combat Organized Crime, and in local police precincts in Baku and cities outside the capital, including Ganja, Lenkoran, and Kazakh. We found particularly troubling reports that police detain and physically abuse individuals, later demanding money from their families and relations for their release. For example, Baku resident Hussein Zulfugarov told Human Rights Watch that his family lacked the resources to pay a bribe demanded by police officials at the Yasamalski district police station in sufficient time to secure the release of his son, thirty-year-old Samir Zulfugarov, before he died in police custody from the severe beatings he was subjected to. Zulfugarov stated that on July 27, 1997, four members of the Yasamalski district police station detained his son in the front yard of his home on suspicion of drug trafficking. Zulfugarov reported that after he visited his son at the police station and saw his extensive bruises and an open wound, three police officers from the Yasamalski district police station demanded a bribe of $2,500 in cash for his son's release. When the police officials visited his home later on July 28, Zulfugarov told them that he had not yet been able to raise the sum; the police officers are alleged to have replied that due to his tardiness in paying the bribe, the amount required would be increased to $5,000. Zulfugarov was not released from police custody, and a death certificate shown to Human Rights Watch investigators cited the cause of Samir Zulfugarov's death on August 1, 1997 as """"traumatic shock,"""" accompanied by internal bleeding and a broken rib. More recently, investigations in May 1998 and November 1998 found numerous credible allegations that police officials beat individuals during and after detention at the opposition rallies leading up to and following the October presidential elections. Against a backdrop of widespread torture and police abuse, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Internal Affairs and the procurator general's office have shown an inadequate commitment to investigating credible allegations of torture and physical abuse in custody. Statistics kindly provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for example, show that only two police officials were prosecuted for physical abuse in Baku in 1997. Restrictions on the Free Exercise of Electoral Rights The OSCE election observer mission's final report on Azerbaijan's October presidential elections concluded that the elections did not meet international standards. The report noted instances of ballot stuffing, blatant irregularities in the counting procedure, irregularities in voter lists, skewed coverage by the official media, and the lack of a clear dividing line between incumbent President Heydar Aliyev's campaign and state affairs. We view legislation adopted in May 1998 and finalized by the parliament in July that governed the October presidential elections as jeopardizing the future free exercise of electoral rights in Azerbaijan. The Law on Presidential Elections stipulates that half of the members of the Central Electoral Commission, which exercises oversight over election proceedings and results, will be appointed by the president, while the remaining half will be appointed by parliament. Since the November 1995 parliamentary elections -- in which OSCE election monitors found substantial irregularities -- created a parliament that is overwhelmingly composed of pro-government members, Human Rights Watch is concerned that the Central Electoral Commission will not function as an unbiased body, but rather may continue to interfere with the free exercise of electoral rights. Members appointed to the Central Election Commission this year can be expected to serve for at least three more years, and are likely to oversee future municipal elections in 1999 and parliamentary elections in 2000. President Aliyev has refused to amend the law in line with suggestions made by the OSCE in its final election monitoring report and by organizations such as the National Democratic Institute. This has stalled the process of long-term democratic institution building because it has prevented the creation of the Central Election Commission as an impartial body that enjoys broad public confidence. On May 8, 1998, local authorities detained and held for periods of five to ten days approximately one-third of the roughly 150 people who staged a demonstration in Baku to protest the highly controversial draft law on presidential elections, which was then under consideration in parliament. Human Rights Watch collected eyewitness accounts of the rally, which indicated that marchers demonstrated peacefully. Eyewitness accounts of a September 12, 1998, demonstration in Baku indicated that police violently dispersed demonstrators, and testimony from those detained under the administrative penalties code during the rally indicated that the police subjected them to beatings and physical abuse after their detentions while in custody of the main Baku city police station, the Sabailski administrative detention center, and the Surhani and Hatainski district police stations. There were also reports of police brutality during an October 9 demonstration, as well as against those who demonstrated on November 7 against irregularities associated with elections. Restrictions on Freedom of the Press Human Rights Watch welcomed President Aliyev's August 6, 1998 decree instructing the government to lift pre-publication censorship and requesting parliament to amend legislation that has hindered freedom of expression in Azerbaijan. However, since the signing of the decree the government has demonstrated a lack of good faith in guaranteeing freedom of the press in Azerbaijan, physically abusing journalists covering events and filing a wave of spurious libel suits against newspapers. Immediately following the decree we were discouraged by credible reports that at least seven journalists were detained by police in Baku and Ganja on August 15, during pre-election rallies. Following the elections, two journalists were attacked during clashes between police and demonstrators on November 7, four journalists were reportedly injured by police on November 16 as they protested against a libel suit brought against their newspaper, and three journalists were alleged to have been severely beaten on November 25 for reporting on a picket in front of the presidential palace in Baku. Azerbaijani government officials have turned to the government-controlled courts to stifle the press, filing a series of libel suits. On July 7, Monitor magazine was found guilty of """"insulting the Azerbaijani nation"""" in an article discussing issues related to Azerbaijani national identity in a suit brought by three Baku State University professors, who sued the magazine """"on behalf of the Azerbaijani nation."""" The magazine was fined and has not resumed operation. The court ruling followed the seizure of the magazine from Baku newsstands by officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in February, and a letter to Monitor journalists in April from the minister of internal affairs demanding that they repudiate an article they had published regarding the practice of torture in Azerbaijan. On November 10, the government-dominated parliament called for the use of criminal and civil defamation suits against newspapers that published remarks by opposition leaders critical of the president and other government officials. The ensuing wave of criminal and civil prosecutions against opposition newspapers is clearly intended to result in fines that will bankrupt them. On December 14, a Baku court fined Azadliq, a prominent daily, requiring it to pay a fine equivalent to $130,000 for insulting fourteen public officials and relatives of the president by publishing a story alleging that they owned real estate overseas. On December 15, a Baku district court fined Azadliq and Yeni Musavat each the equivalent of $39,000 for having insulted the honor and dignity of President Aliyev by publishing former President Abulfaz Elchibey's allegations that President Aliyev played a role in the creation of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. The Baku city court judge who on December 14 had imposed the fine on Azadliq was reported to have applied to the procurator general to begin criminal proceedings for slander against Azadliq editor Gunduz Tairli. Other newspapers that face prosecution are Mukhalifet, Hurriyyet, and Ulus. An April 1998 decree adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers also tightened media restrictions by laying down new requirements for the registration of all independent television stations in Azerbaijan. The decree stipulates that independent broadcasters must obtain a certificate from state-owned television in order to operate. Television stations must also obtain approval from a frequency commission, whose members include the ministers of internal affairs and national security. By mid-December, no independent television station in Azerbaijan that had applied had received a licence under the new procedures. Stifling Civil Society through Violations of Freedom of Association The Ministry of Justice arbitrarily refuses to register nongovernmental organizations, including human rights organizations, political parties, religious organizations, lawyers' associations, and others to impede their activities. Human rights organizations told Human Rights Watch that Ministry of Justice officials routinely ignore registration applications or make onerous requests for documentation not called for in the 1992 registration law. The OSCE international election observers final report on the October election noted that at the time of the elections Halk Azadliq, Vahdat, the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party and Cakdash Turan political parties had all had their requests for registration turned down by the Ministry of Justice on questionable grounds. In April, a law governing grants to nongovernmental organizations was adopted by the Azerbaijani parliament. Although the law applies to all nongovernmental organizations in Azerbaijan, during parliamentary consideration the government failed to publish the law or otherwise make it available to the affected organizations, despite repeated requests to members of parliament and to the president's office. Human Rights Watch is distressed that the parliament and the president's office thus carefully excluded the community of nongovernmental groups from the process of formulating and studying legislation that affects them so vitally. Delays in Legal Reforms Reform of Azerbaijan's legal system has lagged, and the judiciary remains heavily dominated by the executive. Although a law on the judiciary was adopted in 1997 to reform the court system, it has not yet come into force. The Azerbaijani courts therefore remain a de facto branch of the executive; their budgets, as the Council of Europe noted in a November 1997 report, are controlled by the president. Judges of lower courts are appointed by the president, and higher court judges are not tenured for life but subject to reappointment by the president. The procuracy continues to retain oversight over the courts through its power to initiate the overturning of court decisions on the grounds that the judge's decision is a violation of law or groundless. This exercise of their oversight authority (called nadzor in Russian) ensures that the courts are firmly subordinated to the executive. As a result, there is no impartial forum for peacefully resolving disputes or impartially administering justice in Azerbaijan, and hence a widespread lack of public confidence and mistrust of the judicial system. The government of Azerbaijan should, as minimum steps prior to an invitation to accede to the Council of Europe: Investigate and prosecute allegations of torture in police custody and make its findings public. Such public reporting should include, inter alia, the charges brought against police officers and the length of sentences they receive; Insure routine and regular access to all places of detention, including those under the jurisdictions of the Ministries of Interior, Justice, National Security, and Defense for international humanitarian organizations in full accordance with their rules of conduct; Review all cases of those convicted who state that their confessions and the testimony of those testifying against them were obtained under torture, and make the findings of such investigations public; Adopt electoral reforms outlined in the OSCE international electoral mission final report; End arbitrary denials by the Ministry of Justice of registration requests from nongovernment organizations, lawyers' associations, political parties, and religious organizations; Cease the use of spurious libel suits to squelch freedom of the press; Annul the Cabinet of Minister's decree of April 1998 imposing new requirements for the registration of independent television stations; and Adopt judicial reforms to allow all defendants to receive fair trials by international standards. The Council of Europe plays a significant role in fostering human rights protections and advancing international standards throughout its member states. We urge you to raise these issues with the government and to request that concrete, measurable progress be made in each area prior to any further progress on Azerbaijan's application. We look forward to learning what measures you and the Council of Europe as a whole are contemplating to improve human rights conditions in Azerbaijan.

At a meeting in New York on Saturday, January 16, Human Rights Watch urged the Policing Commission to think beyond the """"reform or disband"""" argument that currently narrows the debate on policing in Northern Ireland. Human Rights Watch encouraged the commission to recommend a vetting procedure whereby the records of people who want to serve on a peacetime police force are rigorously examined to determine whether they have a history of committing human rights abuses. """"The ‘reform or disband' debate doesn't get us very far,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director, Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The bottom line is that the police force should have an officer corps free of human rights abusers. Vetting the force will provide a measure of accountability and build public confidence in a peacetime policing service. In a briefing paper presented to the Policing Commission, Human Rights Watch recommends the establishment of a genuinely independent vetting unit that conducts extensive background checks on every person who served as an Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer and wants to serve in a peacetime policing service. Persons subject to the vetting process would be accorded a full range of """"due process"""" guarantees in conformity with international human rights standards.  The group lists numerous sources of information that could be consulted for evidence of past abusive conduct by RUC officers, including classified government documents such as the Stalker/Sampson report; judgments from civil actions where the RUC has been found liable for rights violations; court cases where the bench rejects confession evidence because it was obtained in an illegal manner (e.g. by physical or psychological coercion); investigative files of the director of public prosecutions where the DPP decided not to prosecute officers under a """"national interest"""" exemption; complaints files from the Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC); and inquest depositions. The group also recommends a community consultation process affording the public an opportunity to comment on rights abuses by individual officers.

Last November, in a decision hailed around the world, a panel of the House of Lords ruled that Pinochet could not claim immunity as a former head of state for acts such as torture and crimes against humanity.     """"The House of Lords got it right the first time,"""" said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. """"It's too late now to turn the clock back.

Spain, France and Switzerland are also seeking the general's extradition. The decision was nullified however, because of the possible bias of one of the judges.     Fifty years ago, the Nuremberg trials established the principle of no sovereign immunity for crimes against humanity.

These include the Genocide Convention and the statutes establishing the various international tribunals, including the new International Criminal Court decided upon last summer in Rome with strong British backing.     At last November's hearing, General Pinochet's lawyers admitted that under their reading of the State Immunity Act, even Adolf Hitler would have been immune from prosecution. """"Parliament clearly did not intend to immunize ex-sovereigns from responsibility for these kinds of atrocities,"""" said Brody.     The group's brief also directly rebuts the Chilean government's claim that Pinochet could be tried in Chile.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/14/human-rights-practices-armenia","Human Rights Practices in Armenia","Human Rights Practices in Armenia","Letter to Armenian President Kocharian","01/14/1999","I write to express our alarm regarding the results of a recent assessment carried out by Human Rights Watch investigators into human rights practices in Armenia. I write to express our alarm regarding the results of a recent assessment carried out by Human Rights Watch investigators into human rights practices in Armenia. In 1996, Armenia applied for membership in the Council of Europe, an organization whose primary role is to strengthen democracy, human rights and the rule of law throughout its member states. Armenia's application to the Council is currently under review, and we are deeply concerned by our recent findings that show that the government is falling well below the standards expected for membership. We believe that the widespread pattern of violations that we found in Armenia -- combined with the climate of impunity for their perpetrators -- is indicative of the government's lack of commitment to the rule of law. Our concerns include: Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army that has led to numerous deaths; police abuse of detainees in pretrial detention; legislation that codifies violations of freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance; arbitrary detention of journalists and harassment of the media; and failure to prosecute incidents of election-related violence and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. Given our recent findings, we believe that Armenia's ascension to the Council of Europe is premature until such time as the government takes concrete and significant steps to improve human rights practices, and we intend to recommend to the Parliamentary Assembly that it take no further action on Armenia's membership application to give the government sufficient time to address the concerns detailed below and to demonstrate that it is fully committed to improving human rights protections both in law and in practice. Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army. During a recent in-depth investigation into conditions in the Armenian army, Human Rights Watch found that throughout the past three years officers and conscripts have been responsible for beating, torturing and shooting to death new conscripts. We found a persistent pattern by military procuracy investigators of declaring many such peacetime deaths as suicides or accidental deaths despite significant evidence -- both forensic and photographic -- that the deaths were murders. Senior defense ministry personnel are highly reluctant to hold senior unit officers accountable for such deaths; in some cases, junior officers have been prosecuted, but the convicted officers were frequently released by amnesty shortly after sentencing. Armenian nongovernmental organizations estimate that approximately 200 conscripts died annually in 1996, 1997 and 1998, despite the cease-fire governing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict signed in May 1994. Human Rights Watch considers this estimate credible, and believes that actual figures are very likely to be higher. Some of these deaths are a result of ongoing hostilities in the conflict zone; however, the numerous deaths throughout the past three years in units away from the conflict zone, and deaths ruled suicides in units in the conflict zone, indicate a pattern of persistent human rights violations for which authorities are unwilling to hold officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense's policy of declaring statistics on peacetime deaths a military secret, and instructing journalists not to identify units where deaths have occurred in published reports, has contributed to a climate of impunity for officers responsible for abuse in their units. Further, Defense Ministry officials' refusal to make the code of conduct for military personnel available to the public contributes to lack of discipline in units, fosters a climate of lawlessness in which abuses take place, and hinders judges, investigators, and lawyers from holding officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense has refused requests from nongovernmental organizations, defense lawyers and others concerned with conditions in the army to make public this document. We are particularly alarmed by this development because the code, which details appropriate conduct for military personnel, disciplinary infractions and punishments, and due process during investigations, was readily available to those serving in the Soviet Army in almost all military units and even in most public libraries. As such, we view this lack of transparency as indicative of the government's lack of commitment to guaranteeing a fundamental element of rule of law -- citizens' access to the laws that govern them. Conscripts interviewed during the course of our investigation stated that physical abuse and beatings of new conscripts in the Armenia army is systematic and widespread by officers and by older conscripts. One twenty-year-old Armenian citizen who recently completed military service in Martakert military unit 49971, inside the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast, told Human Rights Watch that physical abuse by officers is rampant even for such minor offenses as being late to meals, failure to salute an officer, and talking during sleeping hours. For instance, he described witnessing an officer beating a fellow conscript in this unit so severely for failing to salute that the conscript's arm was broken. In addition, this former conscript and numerous other conscripts stated that officers routinely ignore severe beatings of new conscripts by older soldiers, and that new inductees are frequently pressured and physically abused by older conscripts and officers to compel them to perform humiliating tasks and to extort money and personal belongings from them. No conscript or family member interviewed by Human Rights Watch expressed confidence that complaints about such abuses to officers would be investigated and acted upon, and in many cases, expressed great fear that complaints would merely lead to further abuse. In unit 59015, located in Zod, Vardenis province, officers have been alleged to have been engaged in systematized theft of conscripts' belongings and packages from home, and family members stated that one junior officer was beaten to death for allegedly refusing to participate in the scheme. Following the man's death, family members told Human Rights Watch that they became aware of ten subsequent deaths in the unit throughout a period of a two and half years. During this period, the family repeatedly sought the assistance of senior defense ministry staff, the military procuracy and the president to sanction officers in the unit, to no avail. Officials' persistent failure to act on the family's complaints in this case illustrates the government's unwillingness to act to curb abuses, and contributed to a climate in which the subsequent deaths in the unit occurred. Two officers from the unit are now awaiting trial in Yerevan for murder and participation in the scheme, but to our knowledge the unit's senior commander has not been disciplined or sanctioned for failing to investigate the family's complaints and implementing measures to alter the abusive conditions in the unit. Another family told Human Rights Watch that they received a letter in November 1997, requesting that they send money to their son, a conscript serving in military unit 34153 in Askeron, Nagorno Karabakh. Family members reported that in a separate note accompanying the letter, the draftee indicated that he had been compelled to make the request and that the family should not send money. This conscript's death in the unit was ruled a suicide on January 3, 1998, despite evidence on his body of a severe beating. Human Rights Watch is aware of five other deaths ruled as suicides or accidental deaths in this unit, including the death on April 7, 1998, of Vahagan Alaveridian, an eighteen-year-old resident of Yerevan drafted in November 1997. Mr. Alaverdian's family reported that after Armenian military officials called them to Hojaly military hospital in Nagorno Karabakh, they identified the body of their son covered in extensive bruises on the chest, stomach, and back, and they alleged that officers and other members of the military unit in which he served are responsible for beating him to death. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has serious concerns regarding conditions in places of detention under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, including stockades in military units and military police holding cells. One twenty-four-year-old former detainee who declared himself a conscientious objector told Human Rights Watch that in December 1996, he was detained at his Yerevan home by conscription commission officials, and forcibly conscripted into military unit 27229 in Noyamberian, despite his statements that he was unable to do military service for religious reasons. He reported that he was then taken from the Noyamberian military unit to the Echivan military police department, where he was held in a weapons storage room of approximately two-by-three meters in size for two and a half months along with eleven other detainees, from January to mid-March 1997. He reported that this room had no toilet, and that guards frequently denied requests to use bathroom facilities. During his entire stay in this facility, he was not allowed to bathe, and had only infrequent access to drinking and washing water. He further reported that food was provided only intermittently at two to three day intervals, usually by soldiers who themselves served at the facility and shared their rations with detainees. We consider such treatment to be cruel, inhuman and degrading, and as such in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 19 of Armenia's Constitution. Draftees who had declared themselves conscientious objectors on religious grounds told Human Rights Watch that they and their family members are routinely subject to harassment and even physical abuse by police, district and regional conscription commission officials, and other Ministry of Defense personnel. We note that due to the lack of an alternative to military service, Amnesty International has designated a number of prisoners currently serving for refusal to perform military service on religious grounds as prisoners of conscious. For several years, we have received alarming reports that Ministry of Defense personnel arbitrarily detain and hold hostage family members of draftees who fail to report for callups. Notably, this practice was cited in the U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997. For example, one draftee told Human Rights Watch that in July 1997, Yerevan conscription commission officials detained his mother, took her to a military unit attached to the Ministry of Defense's headquarters on Ashtarag highway, and held her for four days in an attempt to coerce her son into reporting for military duty. The draftee's wife and mother-in-law told Human Rights Watch that they were detained and held hostage in the same military unit for one day, and were freed only after repeated reminders to the unit's officers that at the time of their detention they had not been allowed to place their minor children in an adult's care and that they were at home without supervision. Reports of widespread physical abuse of detainees -- including children -- in pre-trial detention We are alarmed by reports of rampant physical abuse in pretrial detention facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security and by the failure to prosecute those responsible for it. For instance, police officials of the Massis District police station and Yerevan Investigative Isolator No. 1 reportedly severely beat Hamlet Heloyan, after his arrest in March 1998, in an effort to coerce him into signing confession regarding his participation in a series of thefts. Reports of systematic beatings of detainees in other facilities include a former detainee of the Gumri Investigative Isolator who told Human Rights Watch that on June 1, 1996, he witnessed the arrival from Yerevan of Ministry of Internal Affairs Criminal Investigative Department staff, who proceeded to summarily pull detainees from their cells and severely beat them over a period of several hours. He reported that the beatings were in retaliation for the previous escape of two prisoners from the facility. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has received numerous allegations that police officials at the Yerevan Main City Police Department routinely beat children at the facility who are detained for petty crimes. For example, one seventeen-year-old boy interviewed by a Human Rights Watch investigator stated that in November 1997, he was detained by Yerevan city police officers, taken to the Yerevan Main City Police Department, and severely and systematically beaten for several hours, after which his head was repeatedly forced into a bucket of water in an attempt to coerce him into signing testimony against others. He stated that five police officials systematically carried out the beating, including Nelly Duriyan, the head of the Yerevan Main City Police Department's unit for children. Human Rights Watch investigator found highly credible allegations that children detained in other facilities in the Yerevan metropolitan area, including in Nornok and Erebuni police station, have been beaten by police. The procurator's office has shown an insufficient commitment to impartially investigating and prosecuting cases of physical abuse, which has contributed to the climate of impunity for police abuse in Armenia. Despite three meetings between procuracy officials and Human Rights Watch representatives, and a written request, Deputy Procurator General Haratiyan, whose responsibilities include oversight of the police, refused to provide information regarding the prosecution of abusive police officials. This lack of transparency contributes to the widespread lack of public confidence in the procuracy and the police in Armenia. We are particularly alarmed about this situation because of the great reluctance that victims of torture in Armenia have expressed to Human Rights Watch to make complaints to officials, and view it as fostering the current climate in which witnesses and victims greatly fear retaliation and retribution. To the best of our knowledge, very few complaints against the police have been prosecuted, and in such cases the police have been charged under articles of the criminal code that are vague and not appropriate to the seriousness of the crimes, such as abuse of office. In one case we are aware of in which police officials have been tried for deaths in police custody, these officials have been tried under articles that have allowed the officials to be freed by amnesty after serving limited sentences. In June 1998, a Yerevan court sentenced four policemen from the third and fourth precincts in Gumri to eight years of imprisonment for the August 12, 1997, death in custody of Galust Dilanian. Police were convicted on charges of abuse of office and assisting in a suicide, even though photographic evidence showed extensive evidence of severe beatings on the victim's body. On October 8, 1998, a Vanadzor court freed one of the police officers, Rafik Gaboyan, by amnesty. Given the very serious nature of the complaints about facilities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, we are concerned about the ministry's lack of willingness to transfer both pretrial and post-conviction facilities to the Ministry of Justice's authority, and about the ministry's failure to cooperate with nongovernmental organizations that seek to monitor pretrial and post-conviction facilities. For example, on February 6, 1998, Mikael Danielian, chairman of the Helsinki Association of Armenia, submitted a request to be allowed access into pretrial and post-conviction facilities to monitor conditions. To date, the ministry has not responded to this request. Restrictions on freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance. In September 1997, the National Assembly adopted an amendment to Armenia's law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations that infringes on freedom of religion in Armenia, and fosters government-sponsored religious intolerance. The 1997 amendment prohibits financing for religions with spiritual centers outside the country, which broadly impacts most religions including the Roman Catholic Church, and increased the number of members required for registration of a religious organization from fifty to 200. The law as it was originally adopted in 1991, precludes proselytizing by religions other than the official Armenian Orthodox Church. The law, and the amendment passed in 1997, violate freedom of religion, and are incompatible with Armenia's obligations under Article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees individuals the right """"...to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religious or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching."""" The government's treatment of the Jehovah's Witness organization illustrates how freedom of religion continues to be violated in law as well as in practice in Armenia. On May 22, 1998, the Jehovah's Witness organization applied for registration and subsequently received a verbal rejection from the staff of the State Committee for Religious Affairs. Only after repeated appeals did members of the Jehovah's Witnesses receive a written rejection letter on July 17, 1998. Following the committee's refusal to register the organization in May, the organization appealed to the presidential commission on human rights to issue an unequivocal statement in support of the organization's registration. Rather than issue such a statement, on July 8, 1998, the presidential commission issued an opinion that the matter of the organization's registration should be dealt with in the courts. At present, Armenia has lagged in completing reform of its court system, and the judiciary remains heavily under the influence of the executive. As such, we view the presidential commission's ruling as a dismaying indication of the government's lack of commitment to defending basic human rights even when clear violations are brought to its attention. After the presidential human rights commission's action on July 8, 1998, a smear campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses began in Armenia's official newspapers that included statements by officials of the Armenian government and of the Armenian Orthodox Church. The statements cited below help create a climate of hostility toward adherents to this faith: """"If the case would ever be submitted to court investigation, there would be a large public outcry. Hundreds of people, who have been victims of this sect, separated families -- children affected by its teaching -- would act as public prosecutors....Let them apply to the court, its their constitutional right."""" -- Lazar Sujyan, chairman of the State Committee of Religious Affairs, on July 15, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper, in an interview regarding the State Committee's decision to deny registration to the Jehovah's Witnesses. """"The spread of the Jehovah's Witness ideology is a serious threat to the nation, state and religion. First, they prohibit their adherents to touch a gun, that is, to defend the homeland, life, liberty and religion and thus destroy the foundations of our state. Second, there are multiple suicides among the members of the sect -- students -- twelve years old, hung themselves. Both were from Sunik region. There are cases reported in which women reject keeping their households and bearing children or implementing their nuptial duties. Thus, wives practically disavow the oath given to their future husband when marrying, be it at the civil affairs register or at the church. It naturally leads to the destruction of the family, and thus the nation and the state."""" -- Bishop Parghev Martirossiyan of the Armenia Apostolic Church, on July 18, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper. Statements such as these, which are indicative of the government's deep hostility to nontraditional religious faiths, preceeded a series of violent attacks on religious minorities in April 1995. The U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1995 states that members of twelve non-apostolic religious organizations were subject to attacks by paramilitary troops whose actions were reportedly cleared by high-level government officials. It adds, """"Services were broken up by paramilitary troops wielding iron pipes and guns, pastors and adherents were beaten and kidnaped, and offices were ransacked and equipment stolen. Several victims were rushed to the hospital. About twenty adherents were held for several days or weeks at a military police facility before being released. When asked why they were being held, the commandant told the detainees that it was because of their religious beliefs. The attacks were tacitly abetted by months of articles critical of the groups in both the official and nonofficial press."""" Eyewitnesses with whom Human Rights Watch spoke stated that immediately after the 1995 attacks they were detained and brought to the Ministry of Defense military police headquarters in Yerevan for a period of ten days to two weeks. Adherents to the Jehovah's Witness told Human Rights Watch that members of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Yerkrapah Battalion, a militia group of Nagorno Karabakh veterans headed by Defense Minister Vasgen Sarkisyan carried out the attacks. We are seriously alarmed that over the past three years the government of Armenia has refused to bring to justice any of the perpetrators of these attacks. We consider continued impunity for members of the security forces and the Yerkrapah for the attacks to be particularly troubling as we have received highly credible reports that the Yerkrapah organization has subsequently been responsible for other attacks such as the ransacking of a human rights center library in Vanadzor on July 29, 1997. Arbitrary detention and harassment of journalists We are concerned that the government officials' arbitrary detention and other incidents of harassment of journalists -- coupled with a lack of transparency in formulation of policy affecting the media -- has stifled freedom of the press in Armenia and contributes to a climate of self-censorship. For instance, on September 23, 1998, police detained staff of the Hrazdan Television Company, an independent television station located outside of Yerevan, as they were filming footage of newly installed traffic lights for a news broadcast. Police officials reportedly told the staff of the television company that only with the written consent of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security did journalists have the right to broadcast information regarding police activities in Hrazdan. Journalists were detained for five hours, during which time Kotaik province police chief Armen Yeritziyan allegedly threatened the director of the television station in effort to discourage him from broadcasting information regarding the incident. Journalists told Human Rights Watch that there is an unofficial list of taboo subjects on which the government does not allow reporting, thus choking off public debate on vital issues that have a significant impact on citizens' lives. Journalists stated that subjects the government deems too sensitive for public discussion include the routine conscription of Armenian citizens and refugees into the Armenian army with subsequent forced service in the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast and surrounding areas in Azerbaijan; and corruption and human rights violations by both Republic of Armenia security forces and security forces answerable to the Nagorno Karabakh authorities. Reporters noted that reporting on these subjects was likely to provoke harassing visits and summons for questioning from personnel from the Ministries of Defense and Internal Affairs and National Security. We note that the government has failed to prosecute past incidents of retaliation against journalists by government officials, including beatings and arbitrary detentions, which has contributed to self-censorship and a stifling effect on the Armenian media. There are other factors that contribute to self-censorship in Armenia. Ownership of Periodika and Hymamul, the sole newspaper printing press in the country and the largest distribution service that owns major newspaper street sales outlets in Yerevan, remains in government hands. The government's refusal to divest ownership of these entities gives officials the potential to shut or pressure newspapers who are deemed too critical of the government. We are also concerned that the Ministry of Communication hinders the activities of independent television stations through failure to develop transparent licencing regulations, and by the widespread reports that the personnel of the ministry frequently solicits bribes from independent television station personnel during the licencing process and during inspections. We note that the Ministry of Communication's Committee for Review of Licence Applications does not meet in open session or hold public hearings, the ministry's Armenia Radio and Television Center has not published technical standards and fee schedules for broadcasting equipment, and that the ministry's National Inspectorate for Broadcasting and Measurement has no published standards for conducting inspections. For the past seven years this lack of written policies and transparency has had a stifling effect on the development of a vigorous, independent broadcast media in Armenia, and has allowed government officials to arbitrarily exert pressure on stations should it deem them overly critical of government officials or policy. Failure to investigate and prosecute violent incidents and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. The OSCE's international election observer mission final report on the March 16, 1998, and March 30, 1998 rounds of the presidential election concluded that the election did not meet international standards, and that observers witnessed ballot stuffing, discrepancies in the vote counts, a large presence of unauthorized persons in polling stations, and instances of intimidation directed at voters, election commission members, candidate proxies and even the international observers themselves. This marked the third consecutive national election in as many years marred by serious irregularities. Human Rights Watch has received numerous credible allegations that organized groups participated in ballot stuffing and violence during the first and second rounds of the Armenian presidential elections on March 16, 1998, and March 31, 1998. Reports include Yerevan precinct 1-5, where a group of approximately thirty men in dark civilian clothing entered the polling station on March 16 and beat two candidate proxies who protested the group's attempts to tamper with the ballot box. The procuracy and police have failed to investigate and prosecute those responsible, despite published reports regarding the incident and numerous witnesses on the scene. We note that procuracy officials told Human Rights Watch on November 26 that of the forty complaints they investigated, only in four cases have perpetrators of election-related violations been held accountable. But the OSCE election observer mission report provides detailed documentation of widespread violations at the precinct and community electoral commission level that have not been prosecuted. They include ballot stuffing in Yerevan precinct 4-8, fabricated signature counts in Yerevan precinct 3-24, coupon stuffing in Yerevan precincts 8-30 and 8-16, and vote count irregularities in Yerevan precincts 1-6, 8-14, 11-38, and Lori precinct 1-5. The developments outlined above cause serious alarm. We are particularly concerned by our findings that many of the abuses cited above appeared to be fostered by a deliberate systematic restriction on public access to laws and administrative decisions, and by lack of transparency in the process of formulation of laws and administrative rulemaking. We view this lack of transparency as directly contributing to poor human rights practices in Armenia, and to the widespread distrust in public institutions and lack of public confidence in the parliament, procuracy, police, army, and courts expressed to us by numerous victims of human rights abuses. A cornerstone of the rule of law is that citizens who are expected to abide by laws and regulations should have access to them -- and our findings indicate that in many cases there appeared to be a deliberate attempt on the part of the government to restrict access. For these reasons, we believe the government of Armenia is not sufficiently committed to reform and rule of law to merit consideration for full membership in the Council of Europe, and we intend to urge the Parliamentary Assembly to set aside its consideration of Armenia's application until such time as the concerns outlined above are addressed. We therefore urge you to: -reopen investigations of all deaths that the military procuracy has ruled as suicides or accidental deaths where significant evidence exists that murders have occurred; -promptly make public full statistics on deaths in military units and the results of investigations into such deaths carried out by the military police, military procuracy and Ministry of Defense's office for control and inspection; -promptly and fully investigate all credible allegations of physical abuse and prosecute all officers and soldiers found responsible; -publish all laws, administrative rulings and codes of conduct that govern infractions by conscripts, officers and other Ministry of Defense personnel and that govern conditions and grounds for detention in Ministry of Defense holding facilities and disciplinary battalions; -adopt and implement a law on alternative military service; -carry out prompt and impartial investigations of all allegations of torture and physical abuse of detainees in the custody of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, make publically available the results of such investigations, and prosecute those officials found responsible; -establish a system of independent inspection of all places of detention, including those under the authority of the Ministry of Defense; -allow regular and routine access to places of detention to Armenian nongovernmental organizations involved in monitoring and humanitarian assistance to pre-trial detainees and prisoners; -cease prosecuting police accused of torture on charges of abuse of office; -publish statistics on complaints against abusive police officers, the results of investigations into complaints, and prosecution of such cases, including the nature of the charges and lengths of sentences; -transfer all pretrial and post-conviction facilities such as closed prisons and labor colonies to the authority of the Ministry of Justice; -repeal all provisions of the 1991 law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations, including the 1997 amendment to the law, that are incompatible with international standards; -promptly register religious organizations on a nondiscriminatory basis and desist from harassing members of religious minority groups; -investigate and prosecute instance of harassment of religious minorities by police and other government officials; -divest ownership of the Periodika printing facilities and Hymamul newspaper distribution system; -hold meetings of the Ministry of Communication's licencing review committee in open sessions, adopt transparent rules for applicants seeking television broadcast licences, publish fee scales and inspection standards, and investigate all allegations that Ministry of Communication staff extort bribes from those seeking broadcast licences. I look forward to your response regarding these serious concerns, and to further dialogue with you and members of your government regarding human rights practices in Armenia.

Armenia's application to the Council is currently under review, and we are deeply concerned by our recent findings that show that the government is falling well below the standards expected for membership.  I write to express our alarm regarding the results of a recent assessment carried out by Human Rights Watch investigators into human rights practices in Armenia. In 1996, Armenia applied for membership in the Council of Europe, an organization whose primary role is to strengthen democracy, human rights and the rule of law throughout its member states. Armenia's application to the Council is currently under review, and we are deeply concerned by our recent findings that show that the government is falling well below the standards expected for membership. We believe that the widespread pattern of violations that we found in Armenia -- combined with the climate of impunity for their perpetrators -- is indicative of the government's lack of commitment to the rule of law. Our concerns include:     * Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army that has led to numerous deaths;     * police abuse of detainees in pretrial detention;     * legislation that codifies violations of freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance;     * arbitrary detention of journalists and harassment of the media; and     * failure to prosecute incidents of election-related violence and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. Given our recent findings, we believe that Armenia's ascension to the Council of Europe is premature until such time as the government takes concrete and significant steps to improve human rights practices, and we intend to recommend to the Parliamentary Assembly that it take no further action on Armenia's membership application to give the government sufficient time to address the concerns detailed below and to demonstrate that it is fully committed to improving human rights protections both in law and in practice.     * Rampant physical abuse, beatings and torture of conscripts in the Armenian army. During a recent in-depth investigation into conditions in the Armenian army, Human Rights Watch found that throughout the past three years officers and conscripts have been responsible for beating, torturing and shooting to death new conscripts. We found a persistent pattern by military procuracy investigators of declaring many such peacetime deaths as suicides or accidental deaths despite significant evidence -- both forensic and photographic -- that the deaths were murders. Senior defense ministry personnel are highly reluctant to hold senior unit officers accountable for such deaths; in some cases, junior officers have been prosecuted, but the convicted officers were frequently released by amnesty shortly after sentencing. Armenian nongovernmental organizations estimate that approximately 200 conscripts died annually in 1996, 1997 and 1998, despite the cease-fire governing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict signed in May 1994. Human Rights Watch considers this estimate credible, and believes that actual figures are very likely to be higher. Some of these deaths are a result of ongoing hostilities in the conflict zone; however, the numerous deaths throughout the past three years in units away from the conflict zone, and deaths ruled suicides in units in the conflict zone, indicate a pattern of persistent human rights violations for which authorities are unwilling to hold officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense's policy of declaring statistics on peacetime deaths a military secret, and instructing journalists not to identify units where deaths have occurred in published reports, has contributed to a climate of impunity for officers responsible for abuse in their units. Further, Defense Ministry officials' refusal to make the code of conduct for military personnel available to the public contributes to lack of discipline in units, fosters a climate of lawlessness in which abuses take place, and hinders judges, investigators, and lawyers from holding officers accountable. The Ministry of Defense has refused requests from nongovernmental organizations, defense lawyers and others concerned with conditions in the army to make public this document. We are particularly alarmed by this development because the code, which details appropriate conduct for military personnel, disciplinary infractions and punishments, and due process during investigations, was readily available to those serving in the Soviet Army in almost all military units and even in most public libraries. As such, we view this lack of transparency as indicative of the government's lack of commitment to guaranteeing a fundamental element of rule of law -- citizens' access to the laws that govern them. Conscripts interviewed during the course of our investigation stated that physical abuse and beatings of new conscripts in the Armenia army is systematic and widespread by officers and by older conscripts. One twenty-year-old Armenian citizen who recently completed military service in Martakert military unit 49971, inside the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast, told Human Rights Watch that physical abuse by officers is rampant even for such minor offenses as being late to meals, failure to salute an officer, and talking during sleeping hours. For instance, he described witnessing an officer beating a fellow conscript in this unit so severely for failing to salute that the conscript's arm was broken. In addition, this former conscript and numerous other conscripts stated that officers routinely ignore severe beatings of new conscripts by older soldiers, and that new inductees are frequently pressured and physically abused by older conscripts and officers to compel them to perform humiliating tasks and to extort money and personal belongings from them. No conscript or family member interviewed by Human Rights Watch expressed confidence that complaints about such abuses to officers would be investigated and acted upon, and in many cases, expressed great fear that complaints would merely lead to further abuse. In unit 59015, located in Zod, Vardenis province, officers have been alleged to have been engaged in systematized theft of conscripts' belongings and packages from home, and family members stated that one junior officer was beaten to death for allegedly refusing to participate in the scheme. Following the man's death, family members told Human Rights Watch that they became aware of ten subsequent deaths in the unit throughout a period of a two and half years. During this period, the family repeatedly sought the assistance of senior defense ministry staff, the military procuracy and the president to sanction officers in the unit, to no avail. Officials' persistent failure to act on the family's complaints in this case illustrates the government's unwillingness to act to curb abuses, and contributed to a climate in which the subsequent deaths in the unit occurred. Two officers from the unit are now awaiting trial in Yerevan for murder and participation in the scheme, but to our knowledge the unit's senior commander has not been disciplined or sanctioned for failing to investigate the family's complaints and implementing measures to alter the abusive conditions in the unit. Another family told Human Rights Watch that they received a letter in November 1997, requesting that they send money to their son, a conscript serving in military unit 34153 in Askeron, Nagorno Karabakh. Family members reported that in a separate note accompanying the letter, the draftee indicated that he had been compelled to make the request and that the family should not send money. This conscript's death in the unit was ruled a suicide on January 3, 1998, despite evidence on his body of a severe beating. Human Rights Watch is aware of five other deaths ruled as suicides or accidental deaths in this unit, including the death on April 7, 1998, of Vahagan Alaveridian, an eighteen-year-old resident of Yerevan drafted in November 1997. Mr. Alaverdian's family reported that after Armenian military officials called them to Hojaly military hospital in Nagorno Karabakh, they identified the body of their son covered in extensive bruises on the chest, stomach, and back, and they alleged that officers and other members of the military unit in which he served are responsible for beating him to death. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has serious concerns regarding conditions in places of detention under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, including stockades in military units and military police holding cells. One twenty-four-year-old former detainee who declared himself a conscientious objector told Human Rights Watch that in December 1996, he was detained at his Yerevan home by conscription commission officials, and forcibly conscripted into military unit 27229 in Noyamberian, despite his statements that he was unable to do military service for religious reasons. He reported that he was then taken from the Noyamberian military unit to the Echivan military police department, where he was held in a weapons storage room of approximately two-by-three meters in size for two and a half months along with eleven other detainees, from January to mid-March 1997. He reported that this room had no toilet, and that guards frequently denied requests to use bathroom facilities. During his entire stay in this facility, he was not allowed to bathe, and had only infrequent access to drinking and washing water. He further reported that food was provided only intermittently at two to three day intervals, usually by soldiers who themselves served at the facility and shared their rations with detainees. We consider such treatment to be cruel, inhuman and degrading, and as such in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 19 of Armenia's Constitution. Draftees who had declared themselves conscientious objectors on religious grounds told Human Rights Watch that they and their family members are routinely subject to harassment and even physical abuse by police, district and regional conscription commission officials, and other Ministry of Defense personnel. We note that due to the lack of an alternative to military service, Amnesty International has designated a number of prisoners currently serving for refusal to perform military service on religious grounds as prisoners of conscious. For several years, we have received alarming reports that Ministry of Defense personnel arbitrarily detain and hold hostage family members of draftees who fail to report for callups. Notably, this practice was cited in the U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997. For example, one draftee told Human Rights Watch that in July 1997, Yerevan conscription commission officials detained his mother, took her to a military unit attached to the Ministry of Defense's headquarters on Ashtarag highway, and held her for four days in an attempt to coerce her son into reporting for military duty. The draftee's wife and mother-in-law told Human Rights Watch that they were detained and held hostage in the same military unit for one day, and were freed only after repeated reminders to the unit's officers that at the time of their detention they had not been allowed to place their minor children in an adult's care and that they were at home without supervision.     * Reports of widespread physical abuse of detainees -- including children -- in pre-trial detention We are alarmed by reports of rampant physical abuse in pretrial detention facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security and by the failure to prosecute those responsible for it. For instance, police officials of the Massis District police station and Yerevan Investigative Isolator No. 1 reportedly severely beat Hamlet Heloyan, after his arrest in March 1998, in an effort to coerce him into signing confession regarding his participation in a series of thefts. Reports of systematic beatings of detainees in other facilities include a former detainee of the Gumri Investigative Isolator who told Human Rights Watch that on June 1, 1996, he witnessed the arrival from Yerevan of Ministry of Internal Affairs Criminal Investigative Department staff, who proceeded to summarily pull detainees from their cells and severely beat them over a period of several hours. He reported that the beatings were in retaliation for the previous escape of two prisoners from the facility. Moreover, Human Rights Watch has received numerous allegations that police officials at the Yerevan Main City Police Department routinely beat children at the facility who are detained for petty crimes. For example, one seventeen-year-old boy interviewed by a Human Rights Watch investigator stated that in November 1997, he was detained by Yerevan city police officers, taken to the Yerevan Main City Police Department, and severely and systematically beaten for several hours, after which his head was repeatedly forced into a bucket of water in an attempt to coerce him into signing testimony against others. He stated that five police officials systematically carried out the beating, including Nelly Duriyan, the head of the Yerevan Main City Police Department's unit for children. Human Rights Watch investigator found highly credible allegations that children detained in other facilities in the Yerevan metropolitan area, including in Nornok and Erebuni police station, have been beaten by police. The procurator's office has shown an insufficient commitment to impartially investigating and prosecuting cases of physical abuse, which has contributed to the climate of impunity for police abuse in Armenia. Despite three meetings between procuracy officials and Human Rights Watch representatives, and a written request, Deputy Procurator General Haratiyan, whose responsibilities include oversight of the police, refused to provide information regarding the prosecution of abusive police officials. This lack of transparency contributes to the widespread lack of public confidence in the procuracy and the police in Armenia. We are particularly alarmed about this situation because of the great reluctance that victims of torture in Armenia have expressed to Human Rights Watch to make complaints to officials, and view it as fostering the current climate in which witnesses and victims greatly fear retaliation and retribution. To the best of our knowledge, very few complaints against the police have been prosecuted, and in such cases the police have been charged under articles of the criminal code that are vague and not appropriate to the seriousness of the crimes, such as abuse of office. In one case we are aware of in which police officials have been tried for deaths in police custody, these officials have been tried under articles that have allowed the officials to be freed by amnesty after serving limited sentences. In June 1998, a Yerevan court sentenced four policemen from the third and fourth precincts in Gumri to eight years of imprisonment for the August 12, 1997, death in custody of Galust Dilanian. Police were convicted on charges of abuse of office and assisting in a suicide, even though photographic evidence showed extensive evidence of severe beatings on the victim's body. On October 8, 1998, a Vanadzor court freed one of the police officers, Rafik Gaboyan, by amnesty. Given the very serious nature of the complaints about facilities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, we are concerned about the ministry's lack of willingness to transfer both pretrial and post-conviction facilities to the Ministry of Justice's authority, and about the ministry's failure to cooperate with nongovernmental organizations that seek to monitor pretrial and post-conviction facilities. For example, on February 6, 1998, Mikael Danielian, chairman of the Helsinki Association of Armenia, submitted a request to be allowed access into pretrial and post-conviction facilities to monitor conditions. To date, the ministry has not responded to this request.     * Restrictions on freedom of religion and government-sponsored religious intolerance. In September 1997, the National Assembly adopted an amendment to Armenia's law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations that infringes on freedom of religion in Armenia, and fosters government-sponsored religious intolerance. The 1997 amendment prohibits financing for religions with spiritual centers outside the country, which broadly impacts most religions including the Roman Catholic Church, and increased the number of members required for registration of a religious organization from fifty to 200. The law as it was originally adopted in 1991, precludes proselytizing by religions other than the official Armenian Orthodox Church. The law, and the amendment passed in 1997, violate freedom of religion, and are incompatible with Armenia's obligations under Article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees individuals the right """"...to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religious or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching."""" The government's treatment of the Jehovah's Witness organization illustrates how freedom of religion continues to be violated in law as well as in practice in Armenia. On May 22, 1998, the Jehovah's Witness organization applied for registration and subsequently received a verbal rejection from the staff of the State Committee for Religious Affairs. Only after repeated appeals did members of the Jehovah's Witnesses receive a written rejection letter on July 17, 1998. Following the committee's refusal to register the organization in May, the organization appealed to the presidential commission on human rights to issue an unequivocal statement in support of the organization's registration. Rather than issue such a statement, on July 8, 1998, the presidential commission issued an opinion that the matter of the organization's registration should be dealt with in the courts. At present, Armenia has lagged in completing reform of its court system, and the judiciary remains heavily under the influence of the executive. As such, we view the presidential commission's ruling as a dismaying indication of the government's lack of commitment to defending basic human rights even when clear violations are brought to its attention. After the presidential human rights commission's action on July 8, 1998, a smear campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses began in Armenia's official newspapers that included statements by officials of the Armenian government and of the Armenian Orthodox Church. The statements cited below help create a climate of hostility toward adherents to this faith: """"If the case would ever be submitted to court investigation, there would be a large public outcry. Hundreds of people, who have been victims of this sect, separated families -- children affected by its teaching -- would act as public prosecutors....Let them apply to the court, its their constitutional right."""" -- Lazar Sujyan, chairman of the State Committee of Religious Affairs, on July 15, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper, in an interview regarding the State Committee's decision to deny registration to the Jehovah's Witnesses. """"The spread of the Jehovah's Witness ideology is a serious threat to the nation, state and religion. First, they prohibit their adherents to touch a gun, that is, to defend the homeland, life, liberty and religion and thus destroy the foundations of our state. Second, there are multiple suicides among the members of the sect -- students -- twelve years old, hung themselves. Both were from Sunik region. There are cases reported in which women reject keeping their households and bearing children or implementing their nuptial duties. Thus, wives practically disavow the oath given to their future husband when marrying, be it at the civil affairs register or at the church. It naturally leads to the destruction of the family, and thus the nation and the state."""" -- Bishop Parghev Martirossiyan of the Armenia Apostolic Church, on July 18, 1998, in Respublica Armenia, the parliament's official newspaper. Statements such as these, which are indicative of the government's deep hostility to nontraditional religious faiths, preceeded a series of violent attacks on religious minorities in April 1995. The U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1995 states that members of twelve non-apostolic religious organizations were subject to attacks by paramilitary troops whose actions were reportedly cleared by high-level government officials. It adds, """"Services were broken up by paramilitary troops wielding iron pipes and guns, pastors and adherents were beaten and kidnaped, and offices were ransacked and equipment stolen. Several victims were rushed to the hospital. About twenty adherents were held for several days or weeks at a military police facility before being released. When asked why they were being held, the commandant told the detainees that it was because of their religious beliefs. The attacks were tacitly abetted by months of articles critical of the groups in both the official and nonofficial press."""" Eyewitnesses with whom Human Rights Watch spoke stated that immediately after the 1995 attacks they were detained and brought to the Ministry of Defense military police headquarters in Yerevan for a period of ten days to two weeks. Adherents to the Jehovah's Witness told Human Rights Watch that members of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Yerkrapah Battalion, a militia group of Nagorno Karabakh veterans headed by Defense Minister Vasgen Sarkisyan carried out the attacks. We are seriously alarmed that over the past three years the government of Armenia has refused to bring to justice any of the perpetrators of these attacks. We consider continued impunity for members of the security forces and the Yerkrapah for the attacks to be particularly troubling as we have received highly credible reports that the Yerkrapah organization has subsequently been responsible for other attacks such as the ransacking of a human rights center library in Vanadzor on July 29, 1997.     * Arbitrary detention and harassment of journalists We are concerned that the government officials' arbitrary detention and other incidents of harassment of journalists -- coupled with a lack of transparency in formulation of policy affecting the media -- has stifled freedom of the press in Armenia and contributes to a climate of self-censorship. For instance, on September 23, 1998, police detained staff of the Hrazdan Television Company, an independent television station located outside of Yerevan, as they were filming footage of newly installed traffic lights for a news broadcast. Police officials reportedly told the staff of the television company that only with the written consent of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security did journalists have the right to broadcast information regarding police activities in Hrazdan. Journalists were detained for five hours, during which time Kotaik province police chief Armen Yeritziyan allegedly threatened the director of the television station in effort to discourage him from broadcasting information regarding the incident. Journalists told Human Rights Watch that there is an unofficial list of taboo subjects on which the government does not allow reporting, thus choking off public debate on vital issues that have a significant impact on citizens' lives. Journalists stated that subjects the government deems too sensitive for public discussion include the routine conscription of Armenian citizens and refugees into the Armenian army with subsequent forced service in the former Nagorno Karabakh oblast and surrounding areas in Azerbaijan; and corruption and human rights violations by both Republic of Armenia security forces and security forces answerable to the Nagorno Karabakh authorities. Reporters noted that reporting on these subjects was likely to provoke harassing visits and summons for questioning from personnel from the Ministries of Defense and Internal Affairs and National Security. We note that the government has failed to prosecute past incidents of retaliation against journalists by government officials, including beatings and arbitrary detentions, which has contributed to self-censorship and a stifling effect on the Armenian media. There are other factors that contribute to self-censorship in Armenia. Ownership of Periodika and Hymamul, the sole newspaper printing press in the country and the largest distribution service that owns major newspaper street sales outlets in Yerevan, remains in government hands. The government's refusal to divest ownership of these entities gives officials the potential to shut or pressure newspapers who are deemed too critical of the government. We are also concerned that the Ministry of Communication hinders the activities of independent television stations through failure to develop transparent licencing regulations, and by the widespread reports that the personnel of the ministry frequently solicits bribes from independent television station personnel during the licencing process and during inspections. We note that the Ministry of Communication's Committee for Review of Licence Applications does not meet in open session or hold public hearings, the ministry's Armenia Radio and Television Center has not published technical standards and fee schedules for broadcasting equipment, and that the ministry's National Inspectorate for Broadcasting and Measurement has no published standards for conducting inspections. For the past seven years this lack of written policies and transparency has had a stifling effect on the development of a vigorous, independent broadcast media in Armenia, and has allowed government officials to arbitrarily exert pressure on stations should it deem them overly critical of government officials or policy.     * Failure to investigate and prosecute violent incidents and ballot tampering during the March presidential elections. The OSCE's international election observer mission final report on the March 16, 1998, and March 30, 1998 rounds of the presidential election concluded that the election did not meet international standards, and that observers witnessed ballot stuffing, discrepancies in the vote counts, a large presence of unauthorized persons in polling stations, and instances of intimidation directed at voters, election commission members, candidate proxies and even the international observers themselves. This marked the third consecutive national election in as many years marred by serious irregularities. Human Rights Watch has received numerous credible allegations that organized groups participated in ballot stuffing and violence during the first and second rounds of the Armenian presidential elections on March 16, 1998, and March 31, 1998. Reports include Yerevan precinct 1-5, where a group of approximately thirty men in dark civilian clothing entered the polling station on March 16 and beat two candidate proxies who protested the group's attempts to tamper with the ballot box. The procuracy and police have failed to investigate and prosecute those responsible, despite published reports regarding the incident and numerous witnesses on the scene. We note that procuracy officials told Human Rights Watch on November 26 that of the forty complaints they investigated, only in four cases have perpetrators of election-related violations been held accountable. But the OSCE election observer mission report provides detailed documentation of widespread violations at the precinct and community electoral commission level that have not been prosecuted. They include ballot stuffing in Yerevan precinct 4-8, fabricated signature counts in Yerevan precinct 3-24, coupon stuffing in Yerevan precincts 8-30 and 8-16, and vote count irregularities in Yerevan precincts 1-6, 8-14, 11-38, and Lori precinct 1-5. The developments outlined above cause serious alarm. We are particularly concerned by our findings that many of the abuses cited above appeared to be fostered by a deliberate systematic restriction on public access to laws and administrative decisions, and by lack of transparency in the process of formulation of laws and administrative rulemaking. We view this lack of transparency as directly contributing to poor human rights practices in Armenia, and to the widespread distrust in public institutions and lack of public confidence in the parliament, procuracy, police, army, and courts expressed to us by numerous victims of human rights abuses. A cornerstone of the rule of law is that citizens who are expected to abide by laws and regulations should have access to them -- and our findings indicate that in many cases there appeared to be a deliberate attempt on the part of the government to restrict access. For these reasons, we believe the government of Armenia is not sufficiently committed to reform and rule of law to merit consideration for full membership in the Council of Europe, and we intend to urge the Parliamentary Assembly to set aside its consideration of Armenia's application until such time as the concerns outlined above are addressed. We therefore urge you to: -reopen investigations of all deaths that the military procuracy has ruled as suicides or accidental deaths where significant evidence exists that murders have occurred; -promptly make public full statistics on deaths in military units and the results of investigations into such deaths carried out by the military police, military procuracy and Ministry of Defense's office for control and inspection; -promptly and fully investigate all credible allegations of physical abuse and prosecute all officers and soldiers found responsible; -publish all laws, administrative rulings and codes of conduct that govern infractions by conscripts, officers and other Ministry of Defense personnel and that govern conditions and grounds for detention in Ministry of Defense holding facilities and disciplinary battalions; -adopt and implement a law on alternative military service; -carry out prompt and impartial investigations of all allegations of torture and physical abuse of detainees in the custody of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security, make publically available the results of such investigations, and prosecute those officials found responsible; -establish a system of independent inspection of all places of detention, including those under the authority of the Ministry of Defense; -allow regular and routine access to places of detention to Armenian nongovernmental organizations involved in monitoring and humanitarian assistance to pre-trial detainees and prisoners; -cease prosecuting police accused of torture on charges of abuse of office; -publish statistics on complaints against abusive police officers, the results of investigations into complaints, and prosecution of such cases, including the nature of the charges and lengths of sentences; -transfer all pretrial and post-conviction facilities such as closed prisons and labor colonies to the authority of the Ministry of Justice; -repeal all provisions of the 1991 law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations, including the 1997 amendment to the law, that are incompatible with international standards; -promptly register religious organizations on a nondiscriminatory basis and desist from harassing members of religious minority groups; -investigate and prosecute instance of harassment of religious minorities by police and other government officials; -divest ownership of the Periodika printing facilities and Hymamul newspaper distribution system; -hold meetings of the Ministry of Communication's licencing review committee in open sessions, adopt transparent rules for applicants seeking television broadcast licences, publish fee scales and inspection standards, and investigate all allegations that Ministry of Communication staff extort bribes from those seeking broadcast licences. I look forward to your response regarding these serious concerns, and to further dialogue with you and members of your government regarding human rights practices in Armenia.

Human Rights Watch will meet with Chris Patten, chairperson of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, and the other commissioners on Saturday. Northern Ireland’s police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), has been plagued by allegations of serious human rights violations throughout the course of “the Troubles.” Among the many police abuses Human Rights Watch has documented are physical and psychological ill-treatment in Northern Ireland’s holding centers, the illegal use of plastic bullets, and the intimidation of defense lawyers.  “The RUC has consistently failed to respect human rights,” said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “The Policing Commission has a chance now to set up a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for abusive police.” Cartner urged that officers responsible for human rights violations be held accountable for past abuses and that, in the future, human rights be considered a “first principle” of policing.  In July 1998, Human Rights Watch released a study of police abuse in fourteen cities in the United States. “American cops commit human rights violations, too,” said Allyson Collins, Human Rights Watch’s senior researcher on the United States. “If Chris Patten and the commission are going to study good police practices in the States, they should also look at what American police forces are doing wrong — and be sure to avoid those problems back in Northern Ireland.” Three of the cities the commission will visit — New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta — were part of the Human Rights Watch study. The Policing Commission, established in June 1998 by the historic Good Friday Agreement, will be spending most of its time in meetings with law enforcement organizations in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Toronto, Canada. The commission has agreed to meet with a small number of U.S.-based international human rights organizations which have conducted research and advocacy on policing in Northern Ireland. In a letter dated November 17, 1998, Human Rights Watch urged the commission to meet with civil liberties groups and community coalitions that have been critical of U.S.-style police practices. “Some of the best ideas about good police practices aren’t coming from the police — they’re coming from watchdog groups and citizens organizations who represent the victims of police abuse,” said Collins. “ The Policing Commission is consulting mostly with those doing the policing, but it could really benefit by hearing from the ‘policed’.”  Human Rights Watch will present the commission with a briefing paper on vetting the Northern Ireland police force for human rights abusers at a meeting at John Jay College in New York on Saturday, January 16.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/01/13/mexican-justice-system-complicit-torture-disappearance","Mexican Justice System Complicit in Torture Disappearance","Mexican Justice System Complicit in Torture, """"Disappearance""""","","01/13/1999","Prosecutors and judges deserve much of the blame for human rights violations that occur in Mexico, including torture and """"disappearances,"""" according to a new report by Human Rights Watch Systemic Injustice:Torture, """"Disappearance,"""" and Extrajudicial Execution in Mexico .  """"Mexico's justice system is far more likely to prosecute a torture victim, using evidence obtained through abuses, than it is to send the torturer to prison,"""" commented José Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watch's executive director for the Americas. """"Far from leading to justice, that creates injustice."""" Based on case studies drawn from five Mexican states, the report is the result of two years of investigation. It scrutinizes incidents of torture, """"disappearance,"""" and extrajudicial execution, then analyzes the judicial processes that followed. The report draws cases from the poor and predominantly rural south of Oaxaca state, the industrialized central region of Morelos and Jalisco, and the northern border states of Baja California and Tamaulipas. Demonstrating the variety of circumstances in which the justice system fails, it scrutinizes incidents related to counterinsurgency, drugs, and common crime. Despite a well-developed formal system of human rights protections, the Mexican government has failed to reduce, much less resolve, the serious, seemingly intractable human rights problems suffered throughout the country. Systemic Injustice: Torture, """"Disappearance,"""" and Extrajudicial Execution in Mexico concludes that, faced with widespread human rights violations, the government has opted to treat human rights as an issue to be managed politically, countered with facile statistics, or handled through insufficient reforms or initiatives.  To its credit, the government of President Ernesto Zedillo has recognized that human rights violations take place, and it has called in general terms for greater attention to human rights issues. The report also notes important human rights initiatives undertaken by this and prior governments, including the creation of the National Human Rights Commission in 1990, passage of the Federal Law to Prevent and Punish Torture in 1991, legal reforms strengthening human rights protections in 1990 and 1993, and the recent decision of the Mexican government to recognize the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The report concludes that when confronted with specific cases of human rights violations, authorities are much more likely to close ranks and deny that abuses took place than they are to insist that human rights violators be brought to justice. At the same time, prosecutors are encouraged to use evidence obtained through abuse because they face no penalty for doing so—their bosses do not punish them and judges do not reject their cases. Both in practice and by law, Mexico's justice system is fundamentally ambiguous about what to do with evidence obtained during or following human rights violations, including illegal arrests and searches, prolonged detention, and torture or other forms of coercion. The Constitution and laws on the books give grounds to dismiss evidence obtained through human rights violations and to require the prosecution of public officials guilty of accepting or admitting such evidence. The law is often vague on these issues, however, and courts often rule in favor of accepting impugned evidence.  The report calls on the Mexican government to eliminate evidence that is unreliable because it was coerced or fabricated. The government must establish a system of accountability for public servants, including police, prosecutors, and judges. Human Rights Watch calls on Mexico's Congress to play a more active role in promoting human rights, and it urges greater involvement by the United States, European Union, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and United Nations.

On December 19, at 7:30 p.m., Pourng Tong, 55, an activist member of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (known by the acronym ADHOC), was shot and killed in the doorway of his home in Prey Pongro Village, Ponhea Leu District, Kandal Province. He was allegedly shot in the presence of a member of the commune militia by the bodyguard of a local gravel company that was attempting to evict fifteen families. Witnesses say that prior to the murder, a man stood outside Pourng Tong's house and called for him to come out. When Pourng Tong opened the door, he was shot with an assault rifle. Four bullets hit him in the chest and abdomen and two bullets lodged in his calf muscles. He died within a few minutes.  Local villagers in the area have been working for the past five years grinding stones for a gravel company that has repeatedly tried to occupy the land on which the families lived. Villagers have charged that the company hired a militia unit to intimidate local residents and to ensure that company trucks could pass through the area. In addition, the company offered U.S. $300 to residents to leave. While eight families accepted the offer, fifteen families rejected the money, saying it was not enough to compensate the loss of their land. Pourng Tong had been a volunteer activist member with ADHOC since 1997. He had been helping the group of fifteen families resist the eviction and assisted them in filing a complaint in the provincial court against the eviction threat. He is survived by his wife and seven children. The case is currently under investigation by the Kandal provincial police. However ? even though the deputy chief of the provincial police has told the media that a member of the local militia is thought to have been involved in the murder, and the names of other suspected perpetrators are known ? no arrests have yet been made.

Mr. Duric's trial is scheduled to take place on January 18, 1999, in Niš. He is charged with broadcasting a radio program without a license, based on article 219, paragraph 1, of the Serbian criminal code. If convicted, he faces up to one year in prison. The station was closed by the Ministry of Telecommunications on August 18, 1998, when two policemen entered the studio and seized part of the station's transmitter. While Mr. Duric did broadcast a radio program without a license, he did so only after having been denied a license in a politically-based procedure that violates your government's obligations under both domestic and international law. As we have commented many times in the past, we object to the politically motivated decision-making process employed by the Ministry of Telecommunications to distribute licenses for private radio and television stations. After a complex and contradictory application process, the ministry readily gives licenses to stations that are either pro-government or provide entertainment, while denying licenses to stations that are independent or report critically on the government.The few stations that do get licenses must pay disproportionately high fees. In short, we believe that the state purposefully denies licenses to stations that are independent, and that City Radio, which fulfilled all application requirements for a license under the government's 1998 frequency tender, was illegally denied a broadcast license based on its journalistic independence. Although the second round of the tender is technically still open, City Radio and dozens of other independent radio stations have not received any information about their pending applications. City Radio is the first station to face criminal charges in connection with the distribution of frequencies. Four other stations in Niš are operating without a license, but none of them have been charged with illegal broadcasting. We believe that City Radio, as a member of the Association of Independent Electronic Media (ANEM) and a provider of objective news, is being targeted because it presents information that is critical of the government. We consider the forthcoming trial against Mr. uri to be in direct violation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's obligations to guarantee freedom of the press, and we call on you to ensure that the politically-motivated charges against Mr. Duric are withdrawn. As a matter of urgency, a new set of media laws on the republic and federal level that guarantee the distribution of broadcast frequencies on a non-political basis should be adopted. Until then, we call on your government to permit all currently operating radio and television stations to broadcast without interference.

The full text of the letter follows.   His Excellency President B.J. Habibie Istana Merdeka Jakarta Pusat Indonesia   Dear President Habibie,   Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned by the January 9 attack on Acehnese detainees by a military unit in which four men were bludgeoned to death and twenty-three others were severely beaten. We understand three of the latter are near death. While we welcome the prompt arrest of some the perpetrators and will be closely monitoring their courts-martial, we urge you to ensure that all of those involved in the attack are identified and punished.   In addition, as important as the prosecutions are, we believe this attack was preventable, and we strongly urge you to take steps to ensure that it does not happen again. The attack might have been prevented by the following:  Ensuring that the army does not get involved in arrests, detention, and interrogation of suspects. According to Indonesia's Criminal Procedure Code, only the police have the authority to investigate crimes and make arrests. The Indonesian army, however, has always reserved the right to arrest and detain people during counterinsurgency operations. General Wiranto has repeatedly said that Aceh is no longer a zone of special military operations, but since late December and the sending of hundreds of troops to the region, that is exactly what it has become. Particularly since the brutal deaths of seven soldiers on January 3, the army is as much involved in the arrest, detention, and interrogation of suspects as it ever was during the eight years that Aceh had special military status. We urge you to prohibit the army from taking on these functions and believe that serious human rights abuses could be substantially reduced as a result.  Prosecuting past abuses in Aceh. Since the resignation of President Soeharto, a broad range of people of Aceh have been demanding that military personnel responsible for serious and systematic abuses between 1989 and 1998 be investigated and punished. With thousands of people killed, """"disappeared,"""" tortured, or held, sometimes for years, in unacknowledged military detention, the Indonesian armed forces came to be regarded as the enemy by many Acehnese. That was clear last August 31, after Aceh's status as a special military zone was ended, when departing troops were stoned. The killing of the soldiers on January 3 was a horrible crime and must be prosecuted, but the cycle of violence will not be stopped by sending in more troops with unlimited authority to search homes and unlimited powers of arrest and detention. It is critically important that the people of Aceh begin to get a sense that justice will be done: justice will be attainable only by going back and prosecuting the worst abuses of the past.  Protecting detainees. The January 3 murders of the soldiers should have been an added reason to ensure that police, rather than the army, had responsibility for detainees. It now appears that soldiers from Infantry Battalion 113 based in Birueuen, the same unit as the dead men, were the leaders of the attack on the Indonesian National Youth Building where the detainees were being held. Given the possibility of the violence, extra precautions should have been taken to ensure that.soldiers from Battalion 113 had no role in the operations taking place against suspected perpetrators of the January 3 killings and no access to the detainees. There is no reason why a civilian building should have been used as a detention center in any case.   Finally, we urge you to ensure that all those with chain-of-command responsibility for the troops involved in the attack and for the protection of the detainees are appropriately punished, as well as the perpetrators themselves.

Greece has enacted a number of discriminatory measures to force ethnic Turks to migrate to Turkey or to disrupt community life and weaken its cultural basis. The most egregious example was Article 19 of the Citizenship Law, which, until it was abolished in 1998, allowed the state to strip approximately 60,000 non-ethnic Greeks of their citizenship between 1955 and 1998. Human Rights Watch welcomed abolition of the law last year, but noted that it did not apply retroactively, so tens of thousands of ethnic Turks remain wrongfully deprived of their Greek citizenship. A 1990 law granted the state wide-ranging powers in appointing the mufti, the Turkish community's religious leader who also serves as an Islamic judge in civil matters. In defiance of the law, the Turkish community has continued to elect its religious leaders, who have been prosecuted and imprisoned by Greek authorities. In addition, the repair of mosques is sometimes blocked by state authorities, and those involved in the repair are prosecuted. Human rights violations in the education field affect the largest number of individuals and have done the most to foster economic underdevelopment among the Turkish minority. Turkish children attend schools that are overcrowded and poorly funded compared to those attended by ethnic Greeks. And the two Turkish-language high schools in Western Thrace can provide only a fraction of the needed places, resulting in a disproportionate drop-out rate. In addition, Human Rights Watch has received credible complaints from members of the ethnic Turkish minority, alleging police surveillance, discrimination in public employment, and restrictions on freedom of expression.

During the past two weeks, the islands, located some 1,000 miles to the northeast of Bali, have been the site of repeated clashes between armed Christian and Muslim groups. The clashes have left hundreds of people dead. Partisans on each side have claimed that government security forces were directly supporting their adversaries. Human Rights Watch today urged the Indonesian government to investigate allegations of bias and partisan participation by government security forces in the bloody communal conflict in the Moluccan islands (Maluku).

The clashes have left hundreds of people dead.  Partisans on each side have claimed that government security forces were directly supporting their adversaries. """"Misdeeds by security forces alone are not responsible for the tragic outbreak of communal violence in the region, but it is imperative that the government set the record straight,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.  There are claims that some soldiers have supplied weapons and bullets to combatants on the side they happen to favor, and accounts that some army and mobile brigade police officers have taken sides during clashes.  Indonesian human rights groups have reported that at least some of the allegations are credible.  For the past year, sectarian conflict in the region has been fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.  """"In many cases, allegations of bias by security forces undoubtedly are ill-founded, but a full accounting is needed to distinguish rumor from fact and to bring to justice security forces found to have abetted the conflict,"""" said Saunders.  """"Government inaction on the claims only adds to the groups' mutual distrust of the government and increases the likelihood of further vigilantism.""""  Almost exactly a year ago, on January 19, 1999, as Muslims around the world were celebrating the end of the fasting month, a fight broke out on the island of Ambon, in Maluku province, Indonesia, between a Christian public transport driver and a Muslim youth. Such fights were commonplace, but this one escalated into a virtual war between Christians and Muslims.  Although the communities had coexisted for centuries, tensions had been building for decades as a result of the decline of traditional authority structures, the influx of migrants, the """"greening"""" or perceived Islamization of the central government and civil service, and, finally, the outbreak of communal violence elsewhere in Indonesia in the aftermath of the fall of strongman President Soeharto in May 1998.  Throughout 1999, the conflict continued, spreading to neighboring islands.  In late December, a new spate of violent clashes was triggered following what appears to have been a routine traffic accident in Ambon in which the driver was Christian and the injured bicyclist a Muslim. According to Indonesian government figures, over 1,300 people have been killed since the violence began a year ago, more than 500 in the last two weeks alone.  Medecins Sans Frontiers reports that more than 100,000 people have been displaced by the conflict within the Maluku region and  that at least another 80,000 have fled to the neighboring Sulawesi island group. There have been reports that security forces have used unwarranted lethal force to quell the violence and claims that outside provocateurs have instigated violence.  As with earlier clashes, however, the reliability of reports from the region have been very difficult to judge, with Christian and Muslim sources providing vastly different accounts of what has transpired.  Human Rights Watch also stressed recommendations it has previously made to the Indonesian government in connection with the communal violence in the region, none of which have yet been adequately implemented:  1. Ensure that security forces assigned to Maluku are fully equipped with non-lethal methods of crowd control.  2. Make absolutely clear in all public pronouncements and interviews that both Christians and Muslims have suffered terrible losses. There has been a distressing tendency in both the Indonesian and international media to quote sources from only one side of the conflict. That reporting feeds back into the communal tensions, helping fuel one side's anger against the other.  3. Find and prosecute any provocateurs.  4. Undertake a thorough and impartial study of the underlying political, economic, and demographic causes of tension and prepare recommendations on how to address them that can be discussed and debated in the region.  5. Ensure that international humanitarian organizations are allowed full access to assist the wounded and displaced and ensure that existing supplies are safely and impartially distributed.  6. Ensure that the rights of internally displaced people in the region are fully protected in accordance with """"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement"""" prepared by the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations.

Nearly 80% of the drug offenders who received prison sentences in 1997 had never been convicted of a violent felony and almost half had never even been arrested for a violent crime. """"New York's drug laws are among the country's harshest,"""" said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. """"Not only do they waste public resources, but they also violate basic notions of justice by putting minor nonviolent offenders behind bars."""" Human Rights Watch's research suggests that most drug offenders in the criminal justice system are street-level sellers caught in """"buy and bust"""" operations staged by the police, addicted individuals supporting their habit through low-level positions in the drug trade, """"mules"""" who carried drugs owned by someone else, and drug dealers' girlfriends and wives. Some supporters of New York's drug laws have argued that most drug offenders are violent criminals. The new DCJS data contradict such claims. That data also indicate that many of the drug offenders sentenced to prison are first offenders. One in three had never even been previously arrested for a drug felony, and half had never been convicted of one. According to the DCJS analysis of the prior history of the 10,047 men and women sentenced to prison for drug offenses in 1997: 77.5% had no prior violent felony convictions. 47.6% had no prior arrests for a violent felony. 50.9% had no prior drug felony convictions. 33.3% had no prior drug felony arrests. Of those who had been previously convicted of a drug felony, 89% were convicted of the lowest categories of drug crimes (class C, D or E). 31.8% had no prior felony convictions for any crime. 17.2% had never been arrested for any felony. Only 9.7% had prior convictions for both drug and violent felonies. Under laws passed a quarter of a century ago during the administration of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, even minor drug offenders face mandatory prison terms. Judges cannot set fair sentences tailored to the conduct and culpability of each defendant and the danger they pose to society. The law permits no distinction between a person who makes a one-time delivery of drugs for a small fee and a major trafficker. And the sentences are extreme: a person convicted of one sale of two ounces of cocaine receives the same prison term as a murderer or rapist—at least fifteen years to life. Many addicts who could be helped with drug treatment are warehoused instead in prison—usually upstate and far from their families and communities. Thousands of drug offenders have ended up in prison as a result of these laws. Few are significant traffickers. According to the Department of Correctional Services, there were 22,407 drug offenders under custody as of September 1, 1998. Twenty-five percent of them were convicted of simple drug possession. Sixty percent were convicted of the three lowest felonies—Class C, D, or E—which involve only minute drug amounts. For example, only a one-half gram of cocaine is required for conviction of Class D felony possession—and 1,242 people are in prison for that offense. The DCS analysis also reveals that one in five of the drug offenders under its custody—4,450 people—had no prior felony convictions. Another 7,501 had only one prior conviction. That is, more than half (53.4%) of the drug offenders in prison had one or no prior convictions. Because of the severe and rigid sentencing scheme mandated by the drug laws, low-level drug offenders face years in prison. According to the DCS analysis of the sentences of the total population of drug offenders under its custody, the average maximum sentence for first felony offenders convicted of a Class B felony is 87.6 months, 68.1 months for a Class C felony, 56.5 months for a Class D felony, and 42.4 months for a Class E felony. Even if an offender does not serve the maximum period behind bars, his or her liberty remains conditional until the maximum period is completed. Human Rights Watch recognizes stiff prison sentences can be appropriate for addressing violent crime and protecting communities. But such sentences are misguided and destructive when it comes to nonviolent drug offenders. Indeed, as documented in """"Cruel and Usual: Disproportionate Sentences for New York Drug Offenders,"""" a Human Rights Watch report released last year, New York's drug laws violate fundamental principles of justice by yielding disproportionately harsh sentences all too frequently.

In a letter to the new chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Human Rights Watch urged the OSCE to postpone opening its Kazakhstan office until the government repeals legislation penalizing participants in unregistered public organizations, which has been used to prevent opposition figures from standing for election. The government of Kazakhstan barred opposition candidates on spurious grounds, disbanded public associations formed to monitor the vote, and used legal and extra-legal means to effectively close most newspapers with links to the opposition. Several journalists with state-run news agencies reported to Human Rights Watch that they were explicitly warned against submitting stories even obliquely critical of President Nursultan Nazarbaev. Kazakhstan's parliament moved up the elections, originally scheduled for 2000, in an October 8 vote, which some have maintained violated the constitution. Legislation passed in May banning individuals with administrative sentences from standing for office blocked the candidacies of at least three opposition activists-- including former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin--all of whom had received administrative sentences for participating in unsanctioned political meetings. In the end, four candidates, including President Nazarbaev, gained access to the ballot before the November 26 deadline; only one of the remaining three openly criticizes Nazarbaev's policies.  Registration requirements were onerous and included collecting the signatures of 170,000 voters. Human Rights Watch found that public officials and heads of publicly-funded institutions such as schools, hospitals and other workplaces forced employees and students to sign petitions in support of President Nazarbaev. Some officials obtained signatures of pensioners and apartment-dwellers by means of fraud.

Human Rights Watch appealed to the Indonesian government not to turn the troubled region back into a special zone for counterinsurgency operations and urged it to put together a concrete plan for addressing past human rights violations in Aceh. The New York-based organization also urged Jakarta-based embassies to coordinate among themselves and immediately send a joint diplomatic team to Aceh to meet with as broad a range of individuals and organizations as possible, including nongovernmental organizations, academics and students, influential community leaders, and religious leaders as well as officials at the district, subdistrict and village levels. The visit could be an important means of exploring possible solutions to an escalating crisis.  Human Rights Watch's appeal came after a series of violent incidents in East and North Aceh in recent weeks that the army has blamed on the guerrilla organization called Aceh Merdeka (the Free Aceh Movement). They have accused one man in particular, Ahmad Kandang, of being the mastermind. Kandang was deported from Malaysia last year and has been active in organizing pro-independence activities ever since. The local press has reported widespread belief among the Acehnese more generally that some of the incidents have been provoked by elements within the military itself in the interests of maintaining a large troop presence in Aceh, an accusation the army vigorously denies.  But an important factor in the violence is the resentment now boiling over in Aceh at the Habibie government's failure to take concrete steps toward investigating and prosecuting those responsible for massive and systematic human rights abuses during the eight-year period (1990-98) that Aceh was formally a """"military operations region."""" That status, imposed when major counterinsurgency operations against Aceh Merdeka got underway, was only lifted on August 7, 1998. The two districts, East and North Aceh, where the recent violence has taken place, were a particular target of those operations in which thousands of civilians were killed or disappeared, and many more arbitrarily arrested. Expectations that the Habibie government would address the abuses of the past were high following the resignation of President Soeharto in May 1998, but they have gradually been replaced by anger over lack of any serious action.  Background to the Violence  This cycle of violence really began in Lhokseumawe on August 31, when a crowd began throwing rocks at 659 troops being pulled out of Aceh as part of the formal ending of the region's special military status. The incident sparked off several days of rioting in which two youths were killed and 300 offices and shops in Lhokseumawe and surrounding towns were burned or seriously damaged. The army said at the time that someone was using a megaphone to shout """"Long live Aceh Merdeka"""".as the rioting took place; press reports carried stories of local people accusing a sergeant from the subdistrict military command in Bayu as being the """"brains"""" behind the rioting. The army denied the accusation.  The most recent incidents of violence include the following:  On Sunday, January 3, nine people, including a young woman, were reported killed as military operations were taking place in the villages of Kandang, Paloh, and Pusong in Muara Dua subdistrict as well as in the villages of Buluh Blang Ara and Simpang Kramat in Kuta Makmur subdistrict. According to press reports in the Jakarta daily Kompas (January 3, 1998), the military operations were aimed at finding two soldiers taken hostage on December 30. According to the army, their captors belonged to Aceh Merdeka. Army sources said that one of those killed was carrying an AK-47 rifle, but who opened fire and under what circumstances remains unclear. Six of those killed were pronounced dead at the main hospital in the city of Lhokseumawe on Sunday. Another victim was reportedly buried immediately by family members, and two other bodies were brought to the hospital on Monday. In the aftermath of the shootings, a post office, tax office, and subdistrict administrative office in Lhokseumawe were set on fire by angry crowds.  On December 29, seven soldiers were killed in the village of Lhok Nibong, East Aceh by a mob that the army says was led by Aceh Merdeka. The attack took place after a public bus carrying military personnel returning from leave was stopped by a crowd of people in what is locally called a """"sweeping"""" -- a check of identity cards. Those with military i.d.s were dragged off the bus. According to one account, a trader from Lhokseumawe was stopped in his car by men armed with knives and was forced to take five corpses to the Arakundoe river, where the armed men tossed the bodies in. Three of the stabbed and beaten bodies were recovered on December 31; a fourth was found on January 4. A report in the Aceh daily, Serambi Indonesia (January 2, 1998) said that an eyewitness had seen another car with two badly beaten soldiers in it, then still alive, being driven toward the Jambo Aye dam. The two men are also believed to have been killed, although their bodies have not been found. The army said the attack was the work of Ahmad Kandang. Local activists said that the bodies of four of the seven soldiers had been displayed in exactly the same way that the military itself had displayed the bodies of four civilians it killed in 1991, including by hanging one from a tree. Of fourteen people taken into custody by the military in connection with the attack, twelve were reported to have been from North Aceh, i.e. they were not local people.  On December 20, a mob estimated at 1,000 people attacked the subdistrict military post in Bayu, North Aceh -- the same post that figured in the August 31-September 2 violence -- after a sergeant there was accused of having molested a married woman on her way home from tarawih prayers, a form of worship that takes place in the evening during the fasting month of Ramadan. The army said that even the woman's husband admitted she was mentally disturbed, and that the sergeant in question had tried to take her home after she came on her own to the subdistrict command threatening to commit suicide. When the rumor spread that she had been molested by the sergeant, a group of youths tried to attack the military command. The military said it fired warning shots and called in reinforcements from Lhokseumawe. The new troops tried to evacuate the sergeant from the command for his own protection, according to an account in the December 21, 1998 edition of Serambi Indonesia, but the mob surrounded the vehicle they intended to use, so the army opened fire. Two civilians were wounded, both apparently by rubber bullets. A new mob arrived at the military command about an hour later from the village of Simpang Kandang, but were forced back by army fire. On the way back, in Alue Awe village in the Blang Mangat subdistrict, the crowd attacked an army major and his wife, traveling home to Aceh from Medan in their private car. Both were seriously injured. The major's firearm was taken, and the car was burned. Three other men in army fatigues were reportedly stopped at a crowd-operated checkpoint in Simpang Cunda. They too were beaten up and relieved of their weapons, and their car was also burned.  If Aceh Merdeka fighters had a hand in the torture and execution of the soldiers in Lhok Nibong, then they have committed a major violation of international humanitarian law. Clearly any civilians who took part are also responsible for serious crimes and must be punished accordingly. But the depth of local sentiment against the military shows the urgent need for investigation and prosecution of past abuses. Only if the military is held accountable, and is seen to be held accountable, for those abuses, is the cycle of violence likely to end.","Asia, Indonesia",""
