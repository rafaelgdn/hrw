""""This is a great step forward for global justice.""""     Signing the treaty places no obligations on the incoming Bush administration. But Dicker said he hoped the Bush administration would participate in ongoing negotiations on the court to help shape the practice of the court.     The option of signing the treaty without ratifying it expired on December 31, 2000. One hundred and thirty-six governments have already signed the International Criminal Court treaty, and 25 have already ratified. The pace of signature and ratification of the treaty has picked up speed in the last six months, and Human Rights Watch anticipates that sixty states will have ratified by mid-2002. Sixty ratifications will bring the treaty into force and trigger the establishment of the court. The International Criminal Court will try future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court is the most significant international tribunal since the Nuremberg courts after World War II, and the most important advancement in human rights protection since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.     """"President Clinton has supported international tribunals for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Iraq,"""" said Dicker. """"But his record on international justice got a lot better today as a result of this important decision.""""     The court is designed with numerous safeguards to protect the rights of the accused and guarantee the highest standards of due process.

""""This sudden rush of signatures is fantastic, and it shows that support for the court is near universal,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"Against this backdrop, history will look harshly on President Clinton if he fails to sign.""""    By December 29 at 10:00 am, 132 states had signed the treaty for the court, which will try cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Ten states have signed in the last week. Three more states have signaled that they will sign today.     The new tally reflects even greater support for the court than when the treaty was finalized, in Rome in July 1998, when 120 states voted for the treaty and only seven voted against it. The United States was among those voting against.     The option of signing the treaty without ratifying it expires on December 31, 2000. President Clinton is coming under increasing pressure from members of Congress, non-governmental organizations, and legal experts to sign the treaty in the next two days. A growing number of U.S. newspaper editorial boards have also urged him to sign.     """"This sudden rush of signatures is fantastic, and it shows that support for the court is near universal,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"Against this backdrop, history will look harshly on President Clinton if he fails to sign.""""     The large number of signatures increases the likelihood of ratifications from states worldwide. The court will go into operation once 60 states have ratified, probably by mid-2002. Twenty-five states have already ratified the treaty, with twenty more expected within the next nine months.     The wide range of support for the international criminal court, from countries all across the globe, also makes it impossible for the court to be mischaracterized as an institution driven by a few """"northern"""" or """"developed"""" countries.     The court is the most significant international tribunal since the Nuremberg courts after World War II, and the most important advancement in human rights protection since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.     President Clinton has supported more limited international criminal tribunals for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Iraq and has supported justice in specific countries.     The court is designed with numerous safeguards to protect the rights of the accused and guarantee the highest standards of due process.

In a letter to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch said that Dr. Moncef Marzouki faces trial on December 30 on spurious charges of """"belonging to an illegal organization"""" and """"disseminating false information."""" The charges reflect his advocacy of democratic reforms as spokesperson for the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), an independent human rights group. The Academic Freedom Committee, a group of prominent academics and scholars, called on President Ben Ali to carry out his recent pledge to respect international human rights standards, and asked the president to stop his government's use of physical violence, unwarranted criminal prosecution, and punitive administrative measures to silence its academic critics.  Dr. Marzouki has already lost his ability to earn his livelihood after being fired by the Ministry of Public Health, following highly arbitrary administrative procedures, from his teaching position at the University of Sousse on July 29, 2000. On December 15, plainclothes police officers physically assaulted Professor Mohammed Bechri, a professor at the faculty of Law and Economics at the University of Sousse, when he and several companions attempted to present a petition to the Ministry protesting Dr. Marzouki's dismissal.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/27/letter-president-zine-al-abidine-ben-ali","Letter to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali","Letter to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali","","12/27/2000","We write this open letter on behalf of the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch to express our alarm at attacks on academic freedom in Tunisia. We are particularly concerned about the ongoing persecution of Dr. Moncef Marzouki, a professor of community medicine at the University of Sousse and the spokesperson for the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), an independent human rights group.  Dr. Marzouki faces trial on December 30 on charges of belonging to an illegal organization, the internationally respected CNLT, under article 30 of Penal Law no. 154, and disseminating false information with the intent of disturbing public order, under article 49 of the Press Law. If convicted, he could serve up to eight years in prison. The government's use of these laws to punish Dr. Marzouki for his advocacy of democratic reforms is inconsistent with its obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a party, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression singled out article 49 of the Press Law as violating article 19 of the ICCPR, regarding freedom of expression. Your Excellency stated earlier this month that you would seek to reform the Tunisian legal system, specifically by changing the press laws so as to prevent their use to justify censorship. We hope that you will use the occasion of Dr. Marzouki's trial to demonstrate your commitment to the defense of free expression and academic freedom in Tunisia. This upcoming trial is the latest incident in a pattern of systematic harassment of Dr. Marzouki. Dr. Marzouki already served a prison sentence in 1994 for his political views. Furthermore, the government's efforts to silence Dr. Marzouki have deprived him of his ability to earn a livelihood and support his family. In 1994 he was prevented from continuing his internationally recognized practice and research in public health, which focused on handicapped children. For most of the period since then he was also stripped of his passport, preventing him from pursuing his academic activity outside Tunisia. On July 29, 2000, Dr. Marzouki was fired from his teaching position (his only source of income) by the Ministry of Public Health following highly questionable and arbitrary procedures. We respectfully ask you to encourage the proper authorities to reinstate Dr. Marzouki to his teaching position and allow him to travel abroad for professional purposes and to visit his family.  The campaign against Dr. Marzouki highlights a general crackdown on academics and civil society in Tunisia over the past few months. Most recently, Professor Mohamed Bechri, a member of the Faculty of Law and Economics at the University of Sousse, was attacked and beaten by plainclothes police officers on December 15 as he was attempting to present to the Ministry of Public Health a petition bearing over five hundred signatures protesting Dr. Marzouki's dismissal. Professor Bechri told Human Rights Watch that he was forcibly prevented from approaching the Ministry and was attacked in his car as he was trying to leave. Professor Bechri's companions, journalist Sihem Bensedrine and Omar Mestiri, secretary general of the CNLT, were also beaten. Mestiri was abducted and abandoned outside the village of Mejaz el Bab, some fifty kilometers from Tunis.  In light of recent comments Your Excellency has made regarding the need for greater respect for human rights in Tunisia, we urge you to instruct the authorities to take all necessary steps to identify and prosecute those responsible for the attacks on Mohamed Bechri, Sihem Bensedrine, and Omer Mestiri. Furthermore, we respectfully urge you to demonstrate a genuine commitment to human rights by bringing to a halt the use of unwarranted criminal and administrative charges to punish scholars and academics who express critical views, and to allow them to pursue their research and teaching freely.  Tunisia has nominated itself as a host for the U.N. World Information Society Summit in 2003. This event aims to gather leading figures in government and civil society to foster the global development of the Internet and other new means of disseminating information. We fully support any effort to decrease the gap between developed and less-developed nations in this important area, and we would be pleased to see this summit take place in a developing country whose government was committed to protecting the right of academics to gather and share their knowledge. We hope that your urgent attention to decreasing the pressure on academics will show Tunisia to be such a country.  We look forward to your positive response on this important matter.

But President Clinton still has a chance to shape his legacy: He can bring hope and justice to the lives of millions of people all over the world, decades after he leaves office, by signing the treaty for an international criminal court before the deadline Sunday. The international criminal court is the biggest thing to happen in human rights in 50 years. The court will prosecute people suspected of committing the worst atrocities known to mankind: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Without such a court, we have nowhere to deposit the tyrants and tin-pot rebel leaders who commit these terrible deeds. Just one example: Six months ago, the government of Sierra Leone finally captured the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, whose troops have been killing, raping and cutting off the limbs of civilians in that West African country for the past 10 years. But now that they have him, what can they do with him? After a decade of civil war, the Sierra Leonean judicial system is, to say the least, a shambles. So the past half year has been spent wrangling at the United Nations about the makeup and jurisdiction of a special tribunal -- which is still not off the ground. Meanwhile, the rebels in Sierra Leone are bargaining to lay down their weapons only if their leader is released from prison -- a pact with the devil if there ever was one. Court simplifies things How much simpler it would be to have an international court with judges and prosecutors at the ready, where people such as this rebel leader routinely could be handed over. That's the only way to return a failed country such as Sierra Leone to normalcy: a sober judicial proceeding in which the crimes of the past are laid out, addressed and punished. The international court will be established in less than two years. Already, 122 governments have signed the treaty for the court, and 25 have ratified it. Sixty ratifications are needed. The United States stands almost alone in opposing this process. Virtually every single one of its democratic allies, including all of Western Europe, vigorously supports the court. Court opponents such as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., simply mistrust international institutions that put any obligations on the United States. The Pentagon has legitimate worries that as the world's sole remaining superpower, the United States could become the target of frivolous international lawsuits. But the court has been designed to preclude politically motivated trials. Any citizen charged with genocide or other serious crimes would not come before the court unless his own government had completely failed to investigate the case. That hardly describes the U.S. system of justice. The international criminal court is designed for the dysfunctional Sierra Leones of this world, not for the United States. Some Senate opposition Despite the court's many safeguards and protections for American citizens, some U.S. lawmakers have said they'll never allow it to be ratified in the Senate, which must approve the treaty. And after Sunday, any country that wants to join the court has to ratify it straight away. So Clinton has a very small window of opportunity to do the right thing. If he signs the treaty by Sunday, he will lend American prestige and expertise to the fledgling court. If he lets the deadline pass, the court will go ahead without U.S. support -- and the president will have allowed the forces of short- sightedness and expediency to hold sway over his final days in office. That's not much of a legacy for history. Just ask the people of Sierra Leone.","United States",""

Already, 120 governments have signed the treaty for the court and once 60 countries have ratified it, probably by mid-2002, the court will begin operations. During the course of the next two years a new international criminal court will be established, potentially the most powerful institution for defending human rights that the world has yet devised. The court will prosecute people accused of committing terrible atrocities: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Already, 120 governments have signed the treaty for the court and once 60 countries have ratified it, probably by mid-2002, the court will begin operations. President Clinton, in his final days in office, faces a crucial decision. He knows that the U.S. Senate, and particularly its Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Jesse Helms, will not let this treaty be ratified in the foreseeable future. But he also knows that until Dec. 31, he can sign the treaty without having it ratified at the same time. After New Year's Day, a mere signature will no longer be an option; governments must accede to the treaty directly. The president has two compelling reasons to sign the treaty this week. First, it would keep the United States engaged in shaping the way the court works. Negotiations continue over how the judges, prosecutors and investigators will carry out their work. It is important that the U.S. contribute to helping ensure that the international criminal court will meet the highest standards of jurisprudence. U.S. negotiators have made valuable contributions to the process in the past and they should continue to be involved. Also, his signing the treaty will place the U.S. squarely in line with those who are ready to declare that there is no hiding place anywhere in the world for people who commit crimes against humanity. Those who are accused of such crimes will, if circumstances dictate, be brought before the international criminal court where experienced prosecutors and judges will hear the facts and bring judgment. It will send a powerful message to those who think crimes against humanity might go unpunished. Although it has supported similar tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Clinton administration stopped short when it came to setting up a permanent court, concerned that U.S. citizens might be subjected to politically motivated prosecutions. As a result, the United States joined a minority of seven countries-- including Iraq, China and Libya--in voting against the treaty when it was negotiated in 1998. There is no reason for concern. The treaty includes numerous safeguards to make sure that American servicemen or other officials would not be hauled before the court on political charges. The court will not even have jurisdiction over cases that have been investigated by an individual's own government. This court is designed for failed states with failed justice systems--not for the United States. In fact, the Clinton administration has a strong record on issues of international justice. In addition to the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals, it has supported recent efforts to establish courts on Cambodia and Sierra Leone. And in a speech to survivors of the Rwandan genocide in 1998, President Clinton said, """"Talks are under way at the United Nations to establish a permanent criminal court. Rwanda ... underscores the need for such a court. And the United States will work to see that it is created."""" As the end of the year approaches, many world leaders will speak about their hope for peace in the world. I join those who hope President Clinton will make it a time of action by signing the treaty for the international criminal court.","United States",""

Asimismo, nos complace enormemente el nombramiento de personas con una larga trayectoria en el campo de los derechos humanos en puestos claves en su gabinete.   Quisiera aprovechar esta ocasión para solicitarle encarecidamente que conceda un indulto a todas aquellas personas que han sido encarceladas injusta y falsamente por terrorismo. Me refiero a aproximadamente 250 inocentes en prisión que han sido identificados como tales por la Iglesia Católica, la Iglesia Evangélica y por la Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos. El indulto es la única via que permite a estas personas recuperar la libertad, pues las leyes actuales no permiten beneficios penitenciarios ni, en muchos casos, revisión judicial alguna. Estas personas han sido víctimas de un sistema procesal y penal draconiano condenado por organizaciones intergubernamentales de derechos humanos como injusto, arbitrario y carente de los elementos mas básicos del debido proceso. Y, además, según la opinión de organizaciones no-gubernamentales peruanas muy respetables y con profundo conocimiento en la materia, son inocentes de los delitos de los que se les acusan.   Estamos convencidos de que la Comisión de Indulto creada por el Ministerio de Justicia del régimen anterior, y que ha logrado magros resultados, no es un mecanismo adecuado para encontrar una solución al problema de los inocentes. Dicha comisión fue creada por un gobierno comprometido en graves violaciones de los derechos humanos (según la Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos más del setenta por ciento de los detenidos por terrorismo han declarado que fueron torturados).   Hemos recibido informes alentadores de que el Gobierno de S.E. ya trabaja en la revisión de los casos de los procesados por terrorismo con pruebas insuficientes y que es probable que con motivo de las fiestas navideñas, un grupo de reclusas de la cárcel de Chorrillos salgan libres.

In letters to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, the organization said that a peace agreement between the two sides should allow Palestinians in exile to choose freely among three options: returning to their country of origin, integrating into the country of asylum, or resettling in a third country.  The organization also called on President Clinton and the international community to ensure that individual refugees are permitted a free and informed choice among the three options and that returns take place in a gradual and orderly manner.

These include voluntary repatriation to the refugee's country of origin; local integration in the country of asylum; or resettlement in a third country. HRW calls on Israel, a future Palestinian state, countries currently hosting stateless Palestinians, and the international community to ensure that individual refugees are able to make free and informed choices for themselves from among these three established precedents. To this end, HRW urges Israel to recognize the right to return for those Palestinians, and their descendants, who fled from territory that is now within the State of Israel, and who have maintained appropriate links with that territory. This is a right that persists even when sovereignty over the territory is contested or has changed hands. If a former home no longer exists or is occupied by an innocent third party, return should be permitted to the vicinity of the former home. As in the cases of all displaced people, those unable to return to a former home because it is occupied or has been destroyed, or those who have lost property, are entitled to compensation. However, compensation is not a substitute for the right to return to the vicinity of a former home, should that be one's choice. Human Rights Watch also calls on the Palestinian Authority to uphold the right to return. In the event of a future Palestinian state, Palestinians who have fled from that territory, and their descendants who have maintained appropriate links, are entitled to return and to receive compensation if they cannot return to their former home. While all Palestinians may well be able to make a case for obtaining Palestinian nationality, this should not diminish their claim to return to Israel if they or their families came from that area and they have maintained links there. A future state of Palestine may find itself both a host country (for those refugees who fled from territory in what is now the State of Israel) and a country of return (for those seeking to exercise their right to return to its territory). As a host country it should offer refugees the possibility of full integration while also recognizing that some may wish to exercise their right to return to territory in Israel. Palestinians with links to Israel or a future Palestinian state should also be allowed, at their option, to choose compensation in lieu of exercising their right to return. Countries hosting Palestinian refugees should facilitate a durable solution by offering the option of full local integration to those Palestinians who may wish to remain. Given the long duration of the Palestinian diaspora, many Palestinians have developed strong ties to countries in which they now reside. Offering the option to remain and fully integrate in the host country would not diminish the right to return of the Palestinians. Rather, it would provide individuals with a greater freedom to choose living arrangements that may accord more with their current attachments and aspirations. The international community also shares a responsibility for finding durable solutions to refugee situations and for preventing individuals from being rendered stateless. Consequently, states should be generous in offering the possibility of third-country resettlement to those Palestinians who may wish to exercise it, and in providing aid to assist the permanent settlement of those who choose to remain in the region as well as those who choose to exercise their right to return. Neither the options of local integration and third-country resettlement, nor their absence, should extinguish the right to return; their humanitarian purpose is to allow individual Palestinians to select during a specified period among several choices for ending their refugee status. In addition, the international community should help to ensure that claims of a right to return are resolved fairly, that individual holders of the right are permitted freely and in an informed manner to choose whether to exercise it, that returns proceed in a gradual and orderly manner, and that any redress for past injustices not create new ones. In this context an internationally supported and funded independent determination mechanism or institution, such as UNHCR, should oversee and facilitate Palestinians' exercise of their right to choose one of the three options. If carried out in good faith, a regulated absorption mechanism does not derogate from the right to return. However, every effort should be made to assess individual claims promptly and to ensure that return takes place as quickly as practical. Any limitations placed on the rate of return by either Israel or a future Palestinian state, if they are imposed, should not be so severe as to effectively extinguish the right to return. Underlying our recommendation is our conviction that governments should meet their legitimate security concerns in a manner that is consistent with these principles and other internationally recognized human rights. Mr. Prime Minister, HRW is cognizant that the right to return is a key outstanding issue between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. While this issue has been under debate for over half a century, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been prepared to address it openly only recently. HRW therefore urges that it is addressed within a rights-based framework that would permit individual Palestinians the ability to make free and informed choices from among the three options outlined above. While we make no claim that a rights-based approach pre-empts consideration of the national security concerns of the parties involved, we do believe that it offers the best chance to reach a lasting peace. I have taken the liberty of sending a similar message to Chairman Arafat and President Clinton, and remain ready to meet with you or your delegation to further clarify the recommendations made in this letter or to discuss these issues further.

The decision allows Judge Guzmán to reinstate charges against Pinochet once this preliminary step has been taken. Significantly, the court stated that the interview must be carried out regardless of whether medical tests have been done to establish whether the 85-year-old former Chilean dictator is mentally capable of standing trial. The Supreme Court upheld last week's Appeals Court ruling that revoked the indictment of General Pinochet. In a 4-1 vote, it agreed with the appellate court that Judge Guzmán's December 1 indictment was invalid because the judge failed to question the accused.  """"While we regret that the indictment was overturned, we believe that overall this is a fair decision,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"The Supreme Court has thrown out the indictment on technical grounds. Yet the court has clearly left the door open for a new indictment. This means that justice can still be done in Chile.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed concern, however, at Tuesday's Appeals Court decision confirming that the medical tests (to be performed by civilian experts attached to the Medical Legal Service and the University of Chile) would be carried out in Santiago's Military Hospital. The Military Hospital has been frequently used in the past as a place of refuge for military officers undergoing prosecution for human rights violations. Pinochet's lawyers and medical advisers have met on several occasions in the hospital to plan his defense strategy.  """"It is highly unfortunate that both Judge Guzmán and the Appeals Court have deemed the Military Hospital a suitable place to carry out these crucial tests,"""" said Vivanco. """"Even if the hospital plays fair, a decision in favor of Pinochet could be tainted by the public perception of bias, and justice would not be seen to have been done.""""","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/20/conditions-detention-foreigners-greece","Conditions Of Detention For Foreigners In Greece","Conditions Of Detention For Foreigners In Greece","","12/20/2000","Introduction The Greek Government should as a matter of urgency take measures to alleviate the extreme overcrowding and other appalling conditions of detention for foreigners held in police facilities in Greece. The United Nations (U.N.), Council of Europe (CoE), European Union (E.U.), Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other intergovernmental bodies should ensure that Greece, as a member state complies fully with international and regional standards for the treatment of detainees. Human Rights Watch conducted an eighteen day research mission to Greece in November 2000. The research team consisted of two lawyers and focused specifically on the human rights of migrants. On November 18, 2000, with the full cooperation of the Ministry of Public Order, the researchers visited the Attica General Police Directorate on Alexandras Avenue in Athens to monitor the conditions of detention for undocumented migrants held there in a special detention center for foreigners. They found not only severe overcrowding, but also that detainees are deprived of exercise time, fresh air, adequate amounts of food, proper access to counsel, and proper access to physicians. The researchers observed the general conditions of detention, interviewed detainees, and met with police administrators.1 This memorandum details the research findings of that visit and serious concerns about the general conditions of detention for all those detained, including asylum seekers.2 Human Rights Watch will publish a general report on migrants' human rights in the spring of 2001, but decided to issue this expedited statement to highlight the urgency of our concerns for detained foreigners, particularly for those at the Alexandras Avenue facility. The Detainees The men detained at the Alexandras Avenue facility-with two apparent exceptions- were foreigners detained for entering and/or living in Greece without valid travel documents or residence permits in violation of Greece's Aliens Act.3 They came from Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Burma, China, Congo, Egypt, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Romania, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.4 Most were arrested by the police on the streets of Athens or other Greek cities and immediately placed in detention when they could not produce a valid passport, visa, other travel document, residence and/or work permit. Some detainees said they had been turned into the police by employers after they demanded back wages.5 There were no detainees under eighteen years of age or women at the Alexandras Avenue facility. All of the detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch came to Greece by traveling on foot, by ship, or hidden in a vehicle. Many were smuggled into the country, paying high fees to brokers in their home countries who provided transportation to Greece and, in some cases, false travel documents. The vast majority of the detainees had an administrative deportation order issued against them by the Ministry of Public Order that could not be executed immediately because their home countries could not provide required documentation in a timely manner or would not issue documents to them at all. Some of the detainees were stateless and had no home country that could issue the required documents. A number of detainees had applied for asylum and were waiting for a decision in the first instance or on appeal, or had already been rejected. Thus, the deportees and asylum seekers were being held in administrative detention. According to an information bulletin posted in the detention center, deportees could challenge their deportation order by lodging an appeal with the Ministry of Public Order up to three days after the order was issued.6 However, an appeal to the Ministry of Public Order regarding a deportation order did not suspend the order of deportation; that is, detainees remained subject to deportation at any time despite the lodging of an appeal.7 Due to serious problems in obtaining legal counsel (see section below on access to counsel), many detainees were not able to appeal their deportation orders and most were simply waiting to be deported.8 Some of the detainees had lodged a request with the Ministry of Public Order for a special type of release on humanitarian grounds that permitted them to leave the detention facility but required them to depart Greece within three months (see section below on arbitrary detention). Police authorities insisted that the Alexandras Avenue facility was not a jail and that people were held there only temporarily while awaiting deportation. However, Human Rights Watch interviewed four detainees who said they had been detained for five, six, eight, and twelve months respectively. Numerous detainees had been at Alexandras Avenue for over five months. Those held at the Alexandras Avenue center and all foreigners held under similar circumstances in police facilities in Greece are in detention as defined by the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Body of Principles). That is, they are persons deprived of their liberty without a conviction under Greece's penal code. General Conditions of Detention Overcrowding The detention facility for foreigners is in the Alexandras Avenue police station, the largest in Athens. Police officials gave Human Rights Watch unhindered access to the facility upon authorization from the Ministry of Public Order. Our researchers were not accompanied by police officers during the visit and were permitted access to all areas of the facility.9 Upon entering the facility, our researchers were immediately struck by the degree of overcrowding. Dirty mattresses lined the floors in the corridors and large groups of detainees were seated on them, crammed into individual rooms and milling about on the limited available floor space in hallways. According to police officials, the Alexandras Avenue facility currently houses approximately 150 men in a space designed for 80 detainees. It was impossible for Human Rights Watch to individually count the number of detainees, but based on the number who slept in each room-coupled with the number of detainees who lived in the corridors-the number 150 appeared quite low.   There were nineteen narrow rooms in two large blocks, each room approximately twelve square meters or 130 square feet, and a small cell in which a mentally disturbed detainee was held. According to police officials, each room should sleep four people. Numerous detainees actually live and sleep on the floors of the inner corridors of the blocks. As many as twelve detainees shared four single mattresses in the corridor of one section of the center. The mattresses were thin and narrow and clearly designed for a single person. Due to the overcrowding, the average room sleeps between seven and twelve detainees. One series of rooms we viewed held nine, ten, twelve, eleven, eight and ten detainees respectively.10 Some mattresses were on frames but at least four were on the floors of most rooms. There is no floor space on which to walk when all the detainees are laying down. Detainees are forced to walk on each other's bedding to get to and from their mattresses during sleeping hours. During the day, mattresses are piled against a wall in some rooms to allow a passage for walking. Persons living in the hallways routinely tolerate other detainees walking across their bedding. Detainees told Human Rights Watch-and prison officials subsequently confirmed-that approximately forty detainees had been deported the day before our visit. Thus, on November 17, 2000, approximately 190 detainees shared space designed for less than half that number. Light The corridors in each of the blocks were dimly lit but there were no lights at all in any of the individual rooms. The corridor lights provided minimal light in the rooms after sunset,11 certainly not enough to read. Human Rights Watch researchers had to let their eyes adjust to the lack of light before they could even determine how many people were housed in a single room. The lights in the corridors and toilet/shower rooms were kept on twenty-four hours per day. Detainees living in the corridors complained that the constant light made it difficult to sleep. There was no natural light at all during the day in the inner corridors where these detainees stayed. Windows in the outer corridors provided some light in the individual rooms during the day. Hygiene Police officials claimed that """"many people"""" were employed to clean the cells """"every day"""" but Human Rights Watch found little evidence of regular cleaning. Despite best efforts by detainees, the cells and individual rooms of the detention center were filthy. The severe overcrowding in the center has led to unsanitary conditions that could pose a serious threat to the health of the detainees. The center is roach infested and our researchers viewed roaches crawling on the walls, on the water fountain, and on the detainees as they spoke with us. Due to the lack of light in the individual rooms, roaches appeared on the walls in abundance. Detainees complained of finding roaches in their bedding and crawling on them, both during the day and at night. Each of the two blocks had one room with three toilets, three showers, and three or four sinks. Detainees complained that, until recently, the toilets had been malfunctioning and they had to clean themselves after using the toilet with water from old soda bottles. In one of the blocks, only two of the three toilets was functioning. Each detainee was responsible for washing his own clothes. Piles of laundry litter the bathroom and lines of drying clothing ring the room. Detainees wash their laundry in the same basins used for personal hygiene such as tooth brushing. They must purchase soaps and toilet paper with their own money and many claimed that police officers selling these products charged them excessive amounts for them. The mattresses were filthy and those in the hallways were particularly dirty because detainees routinely walked over them to get to and from the phone, the toilet or other rooms. Detainees must provide and launder their own sheets. Meals Detainees complained of insufficient amounts of food and that the type of food served was nutritionally deficient. Two meals-at midday and in the evening-are provided. Breakfast is not provided and detainees must purchase coffee and a morning meal from police officers out of their personal accounts. Police authorities claimed that detainees were served the same food from the same cafeteria where the police ate. Detainees complained that the food was heavy in carbohydrates and that little protein or fresh produce was provided. Human Rights Watch was present during the serving of the evening meal. Each detainee was given a small container of what looked like rice or pasta with some type of green vegetable mixed in. While the food did not appear appetizing, it is unclear whether or not it was nutritionally deficient. The amount, however, was clearly insufficient for an adult male from 8:00 p.m. until 1:00 p.m. the following day when the next meal would be provided. Detainees without access to independent funds were at a serious disadvantage as they were unable to purchase a morning meal. One fountain (without cups) in each block provides tepid water for approximately seventy-five detainees. No other beverages are provided. Health and Welfare Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that the conditions of detention in the Alexandras Avenue center have had and will continue to have an adverse affect on the physical and mental health of the detainees. According to police authorities, detainees can make a simple oral request to see a physician due to a medical problem and an appointment with a doctor will be arranged by the police.12 Several detainees, however, complained to Human Rights Watch about health problems and claimed that, despite repeated requests to see a doctor, they were denied medical care. A twenty-five year old Pakistani detainee told Human Rights Watch that he was experiencing severe rectal bleeding and had repeatedly requested to see a physician. Numerous detainees confirmed that the man was, in fact, ill and had asked to see a doctor more than once-but his requests were ignored. A Palestinian man in his fifties had a blood disorder requiring medication. The detainee had been in the detention center for seven months and felt that the dosage for his medication needed to be adjusted because a serious side effect was his inability to keep food down. The police administered the medication but, according to the man, would not arrange an appointment with a physician. A Romanian detainee with a heart condition claimed that he had been requesting to see a doctor for one month but his requests were ignored. A Pakistani man whose three fingers were recently sliced off in a work accident was concerned about infection. He had been in the center for nearly one month and had seen a doctor only once despite repeated requests. Our researchers observed two detainees in particular with obvious mental health problems. A Chinese man who had been detained for five months had ceased to speak and was withdrawn and listless. He sat in a corner of a bed and did not engage anyone. Other detainees told Human Rights Watch that he had """"gone crazy"""" and """"lost his mind."""" Another detainee from the Sudan had been physically separated from the rest of the population and placed in a smaller """"cell"""" completely constructed of bars. This cell had constant light. The Sudanese detainee was labeled by other detainees as """"aggressive"""" and responsible for starting fights. He appeared confused and agitated when speaking with Human Rights Watch. Both the Chinese and Sudanese detainees clearly required psychological support but were not receiving counseling of any sort.13 Numerous detainees noted that the lack of information about why or how long they would be detained, about family members, and about the status of their asylum claims often caused depression, frustration and anger. Exercise, Education, Social Services The detainees are not permitted to exercise outdoors or in an indoor facility nor do they have regular access to fresh air. Despite long periods of detention, they have no access at all to educational programs or social services. Communication  One telephone is available for use by all the detainees in both blocks. They can use it at any time but must purchase their own phone card. The day that Human Rights Watch visited, the line for the phone was extremely long. Access to Counsel There is no state supported general legal aid scheme for the indigent in Greece,14 although asylum seekers can access free legal counsel if they know what organizations offer representation. Detainees awaiting deportation at the Alexandras Avenue detention facility must pay for their own legal counsel. Numerous detainees complained that they and their families could not afford the high costs of retaining legal counsel. Human Rights Watch interviewed thirteen detainees who had applied for asylum. The Greek Council for Refugees (GCR) was providing free legal representation to some of these asylum seekers. According to UNHCR, however, """"There is no system in place that would guarantee that all those in detention who seek asylum will be seen and assisted by GCR or any other non-profit organization.""""15 Thus, although lawyers from the GCR theoretically have access to asylum seekers in detention facilities, the detainees are not given any information about their right to seek asylum or the possibility of free legal counsel for the duration of the procedure. For example, the Information Bulletin for Foreigners/Aliens Being Detained for Deportation that is posted in the center does not include any information about seeking asylum or the provision of legal counsel for asylum seekers.16 Access to legal counsel for asylum seekers is thus a matter of chance; those who know about the GCR, can speak Greek or English (or have someone who does speak these languages intervene on their behalf), and can get access to a phone might have the possibility of representation. The paucity of phones creates a considerable bar to maintaining regular contact with family members and legal counsel. It is nearly impossible to receive a phone call because the phone is in constant use. Therefore, lawyers and nongovernmental organizations working with detainees must appear in person to maintain contact. Moreover, one frustrated lawyer who represents both asylum seekers and undocumented migrants told Human Rights Watch that gaining access to her clients in detention centers often took her one-half of an entire day due to the bureaucracy.17 Although detainees can meet with their lawyers at any time, the facilities do not permit privacy. A small table with three chairs is positioned right outside one of the blocks next to the station where police guards sit-clearly within earshot of police guards. Police Abuse Detainees at the Alexandras Avenue facility did not, in general, complain about physical abuse by police officers in the course of daily life at the detention center. Physical abuse in the process of deportation, however, was reported to be more common. On November 10, 2000, Human Rights Watch interviewed Nimal Rathnayke, a Sri Lankan detainee at the Alexandras Avenue center, who reported that he had been badly beaten the night before when he resisted deportation. Rathnayke had been detained for eight months at the time that he and his wife, Gopalagae Priyanthika, were scheduled for deportation on November 9. Their asylum claim had been rejected both in the first instance and on appeal. Rathnayke had been held in detention during the course of the asylum procedure. According to Rathnayke, the day the police attempted to deport him and his wife he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. Rathnayke admitted that he verbally protested and physically resisted the officers trying to deport him. He told the police officers in the deportation office that he did not want to go back to Sri Lanka because he feared that he would be killed. Rathnayke's description of the beating that ensued coupled with the fresh physical injuries he exhibited, however, raise serious questions about the degree of force used to subdue him and his wife. Moreover, he said the beating continued long after he ceased to resist. According to Rathnayke, he and his wife were beaten in full view in the deportation office, the hallway outside, in the elevator, and in the car on the way to the airport: They [the police] were dragging me on the floor. One man was beating me in the back and kicking me. He was kicking the back of my ankle, the inside bone is very painful, maybe broken. No one cares. All the building people came out [into the hallway]. No one stopped it. They put my face against the wall [demonstrates head being pushed into the wall] in the elevator and beat my head [demonstrates being punched from behind at the base of the neck]. The police pulled my wife by her hair and punched her with fists in the jaw on both sides. They put me in the lift to go down and beat, beat, beat. Three police. One beat, the other two did not. Hands, kicks. Then he [the police officer] has a cigarette break and starts again.18 Rathnayke had severe bruising on the back of his neck. He walked with a visible limp, his left leg was bruised and slightly scabbed, and he held his midsection indicating pain in his ribs. His wrists were bruised and cut. At the airport, he and his wife, still handcuffed, shouted loudly that they did not want to board the Saudi Airlines flight to Sri Lanka and airline officials refused to transport them. Rathnayke told Human Rights Watch that the beating continued in the car, in the elevator up to the deportation floor and as they took him back to his room. He was not resisting deportation at that time: Kicking in the back and I fall down and then kicking in the back and falling down. Kicking me with big boots, stomping on my feet. [Indicates kicking in genital area.] Another officer asked why they were beating us. Beat me in the head and jaw with fists and had on gloves.19 Rathnayke said that he did not request medical care because he was afraid they would beat him again. His wife was transported to a detention center for women.20 According to Maria Kossida, Rathnayke's lawyer for his asylum claim: Police abuse is common. When an arrested person doesn't cooperate or resists, then he is beaten...If a person continues to resist deportation, they won't beat him to death, but will try to get him to go home. They don't want him any longer.""""21 Arbitrary Detention As noted above, many of the detainees at Alexandras Avenue have been held for over five months and some have been detained for up to a year. Detainees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Sudan simply cannot be deported due to embargoes, internal conflicts, and/or the absence of diplomatic facilities in Greece. Some detainees are stateless. Detainees who cannot be deported are thus subjected to a form of indefinite detention. Police authorities claim that it takes a great deal of time for the embassies or consulates of the detainees' home countries to respond to requests for documents so that their nationals can be deported. When queried as to what happens when a detainee cannot be deported under any circumstances in the foreseeable future, police officials responded that, """"We are trying here to find a way. As soon as we can find this way, the man is free.""""22 Given the remote possibility of being able to deport detainees from the countries noted above, indefinite periods of detention can be expected to continue in the absence of reform. Rafat Baroud, a thirty-three year old stateless Palestinian man who had been in Greece for ten years (part of that time as a student) before being detained, told Human Rights Watch that he cannot be deported. He had been in detention for over four months and feared that he would be in detention indefinitely. He told us that he has offered to go anywhere: """"I told them [the police] if there's any country that will take me, I will go.""""23 Police officials at the Alexandras Avenue detention center also noted that they can and do release some detainees with a verbal warning to leave Greece within three months. According to the police, the Ministry of Public Order makes the determinations for such releases with information on the detainee population provided by the detention facility. Detention of Asylum Seekers Numerous detainees told Human Rights Watch that they had applied for asylum and were awaiting a determination in the first instance or on appeal. UNHCR has expressed to the Greek authorities on various occasions its concern for detained asylum seekers. According to Maria Stavropoulou, UNHCR protection officer, """"in the majority of cases, they were first arrested and detained and then they applied for asylum. The reasons for not having applied for asylum range from ignorance about the system, lack of interest in applying for asylum in Greece, to difficulties in getting registered as an asylum seeker with the police.""""24 (See section below on international standards governing the detention of asylum seekers.) Official Response The police authorities at Alexandras Avenue were extremely cooperative. They would not, however, acknowledge the appalling nature of conditions for detainees at the facility, nor did they adequately explain why such conditions existed or when improvements would be undertaken. With respect to the general conditions of detention detailed above, officials admitted that the facility was overcrowded but insisted that it was clean, detainees were provided with good food, and that medical care was provided. When Human Rights Watch detailed the conditions they found and noted that they violated Greece's international and regional obligations, officials responded that a new building was going to be built in about six months to house foreign detainees. When asked what could be done immediately, police authorities said, """"It is too difficult to do something now. Only the Ministry [of Public Order] can.""""25 International and Regional Standards Conditions of Detention The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Standard Minimum Rules) and the European Prison Rules serve as authoritative guides for states on how to comply with their international and regional obligations to protect the human rights of persons held in all forms of detention. Key provisions of both sets of rules require: · Sleeping accommodations that meet basic requirements of health and hygiene including adequate sleep space, air, lighting, heat and ventilation. The European Prison Rules recommend individual cells or shared accommodation with reasonable space for each detainee and a separate bed and bedding for each detainee; · Adequate bathing and shower installations; · Proper maintenance and cleaning of all parts of a detention facility; · Provision of toilet articles as necessary for health and cleanliness; · Food of nutritional value adequate for health provided at normal times; drinking water available at all times; · Access to medical and psychiatric care and psychological support services; · Absolute prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; · Communication, both written and oral, with detainees in a language that they can understand; · System for making complaints; · Provision for regular exercise and access to natural light and fresh air; · Provision of a library, educational programs, and access to necessary social services; · Separation of detainees in separate facilities away from convicted felons. Moreover, the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Body of Principles), adopted in 1988, state that detained individuals have the following basic rights:   · """"Not to be kept in detention without being given an effective opportunity to be heard promptly by a judicial or other authority""""; the right """"at any time to take proceedings according to domestic law before a judicial or other authority to challenge the lawfulness of their detention,"""" and the right to do so through proceedings that are """"simple and expeditious and at no cost for detained persons without adequate means""""; · To have the assistance of legal counsel, to have legal counsel assigned to him if he cannot afford his own lawyers, to receive reasonable help in obtaining counsel, to have adequate time and facilities to communicate with legal counsel, to be able to communicate in full confidentiality with legal counsel (interviews between a detained or imprisoned person and his legal counsel may be within sight, but not within the hearing, of a law enforcement official); · To have an """"adequate opportunity to communicate with the outside world""""; · To be informed of disciplinary rules prevailing in a given detention center, to appeal any disciplinary action, and to make a request or complaint regarding treatment or detention conditions;   · To make a request or complaint regarding treatment, in particular in case of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, to the authorities responsible for the administration of the place of detention and to higher authorities and, when necessary, to appropriate authorities vested with reviewing or remedial powers.   The substandard conditions of detention in the Alexandras Avenue detention facility detailed above violate many of the requirements of both internationally and regionally recognized basic minimum standards for the treatment of detainees. Moreover, the Standard Minimum Rules is an authoritative set of guidelines for interpreting article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and ICCPR article 10 which states that """"[a]ll persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.""""26 Detainees at the Alexandras Avenue detention center are sometimes held there for many months-even up to one year-and some are held for indefinite periods.27 The long periods of detention in combination with the conditions endured by detainees-overcrowding; lack of adequate sleeping accommodations; no access to fresh air or exercise; a roach infested and dirty environment; food of questionable adequacy; questionable access to medical care;-raise serious concerns that these conditions may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Arbitrary Detention It is a fundamental principle of human rights that no one should be arbitrarily placed in detention. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that """"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile"""" and article 9 of the ICCPR declares similarly that """"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention [or] be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established by law."""" Detention is considered """"arbitrary"""" if it is not authorized by law or in accordance with law. It is also arbitrary when it is random, capricious, or not accompanied by fair procedures for legal review. Arbitrary detention has also been defined as not only contrary to law but as including elements of injustice and lack of predictability. Due to the growing phenomenon of indefinite detention of migrants and refugees, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention recently developed criteria for determining whether or not the deprivation of liberty of migrants and asylum seekers is arbitrary. Principle Three mandates that a migrant or asylum seeker placed in custody """"must be brought promptly before a judge or other authority"""" and Principle Seven requires that a """"maximum period should be set by law and the custody may in no case be unlimited or of excessive length.""""28 Some migrant detainees in Alexandras Avenue cannot be deported because they are stateless, or because their own country or any third country will not accept them. Human Rights Watch maintains that when migrant detainees are held indefinitely and do not know when, if ever, they will be released, their detention becomes arbitrary even if the initial detention was carried out in accordance with the law. Detention of Asylum Seekers International standards state that those seeking asylum generally should not be detained. The 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees define a """"refugee"""" as a person who has fled his or her home country because of """"a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion."""" Article 31 of the Refugee Convention states that governments """"shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened...enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence."""" The convention goes on to state that """"[c]ontracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary."""" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Guidelines on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers (UNHCR Guidelines)29 clarify these provisions with regard to those who are seeking asylum by reaffirming the basic human right to seek and enjoy asylum and by stating as an explicit guideline that """"[a]s a general rule, asylum seekers should not be detained."""" The UNHCR Guidelines also note that detention should not be used as a punitive or disciplinary measure, and that detention should not be used as a means of discouraging refugees from applying for asylum. Indeed, even if detention is not explicitly used to discourage asylum applicants but merely to discourage future immigration altogether-including asylum seekers-such a use of detention undermines the right of every person to seek asylum as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although it is an accepted premise of international law that asylum seekers should not, in general, be detained, the Refugee Convention does permit states to detain asylum seekers in certain limited circumstances. Thus, """"[i]n time of war or other grave and exceptional circumstances,"""" states may take """"provision[al] measures"""" to detain asylum seekers, """"pending the determination that the person is in fact a refugee and that the continuance of such measures is necessary in the interests of national security."""" The UNHCR Guidelines further elaborate the instances in which asylum seekers may be detained: (I) to verify identity; (ii) to determine the elements on which the claim for refugee status or asylum is based; (iii) in cases where refugees or asylum seekers have destroyed their travel and/or identity documents or have used fraudulent documents in order to mislead the authorities of the State in which they intend to claim asylum; or (iv) to protect national security or public order. However, under the exception regarding the determination of the elements of a claim, the guidelines state that """"[t]his exception...cannot be used to justify detention for the entire status determination procedure, or for an unlimited period of time."""" According to the Guidelines, any other reason for detaining asylum seekers, such as part of a policy to deter future asylum seekers, is contrary to principles of international law. The guidelines emphasize that """"detention [should] only be imposed where it is necessary and reasonable to do so and without discrimination. It should be proportional to the ends to be achieved and for a minimal period."""" As noted above, UNHCR has expressed its concerns about the detention of asylum seekers to the Greek government on more than one occasion. As well, the Ecumenical Refugee Program in Athens has brought similar concerns to the attention of the government.30 The general principle stands that asylum seekers should not be detained. Alternative, non-custodial monitoring mechanisms (e.g. reporting requirements) should be employed as a matter of first course. Detention should only be used under exceptional circumstances and when it is prescribed by national law in conformity with international standards. Moreover, detention should be applied strictly on a case-by-case basis with a thorough review of an individual asylum seeker's circumstances. Recommendations Government of Greece Conditions of Detention Measures should be taken immediately to reduce overcrowding at the Alexandras Avenue detention center and other detention facilities specifically designated for foreigners. The government cannot consider the construction of a new detention facility as an immediate measure; · Conditions of detention for foreigners should conform with international and regional standards, including the U.N. Minimum Standard Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons Under Any Form of Detention, and the European Prison Rules. In particular, at a minimum, each detainee should have reasonable sleeping space in an environment conducive to restful sleep, his/her own bed, and adequate bedding; three nutritious meals per day; a clean environment free from insects; adequate toilet/bath facilities and the provision of toiletries; access to reading lights at night and natural light during the day; effective access to medical care and psychological services; adequate means to contact and facilities to meet in confidence with legal counsel; one hour of exercise per day; and access to educational and social service programs; · Asylum seekers, in general, should not be detained. Exceptions to this general principle should be applied on a case-by-case basis only and as a matter of last resort. Asylum seekers must have a prompt and effective opportunity to challenge a detention order before a judicial or administrative body independent of the detaining authorities. Periodic reviews of continuing detention should be conducted and asylum seekers and their representatives should have the right to be present at such reviews; · Detention of those awaiting deportation must be subject to a maximum time limit, authorized by domestic law in conformity with the international law, in particular the prohibition against arbitrary detention; · Undocumented migrants must have a prompt and effective opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of both their detention and deportation order in a judicial proceeding or before another competent authority. Continued detention should be subject to periodic review; · Information bulletins detailing the rights of detainees to minimum standards of treatment and due process guarantees should be made available to every person in a language that he/she can understand. In cases of detainees who cannot read, this information should be presented orally in a language they can understand; · Detainees should be informed in a language they can understand of their right to seek asylum, the procedure for filing an asylum claim, and the contact numbers of appropriate agencies that provide free legal representation for the asylum procedure;     · A complaints procedure regarding conditions of detention should be developed and implemented. All detainees should be informed of the existence of a complaints procedure in a language he/she understands. Detainees should have access to a judicial remedy for abuses suffered in detention (e.g. police abuse) that amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; · Detainees should have access to legal counsel. Those who cannot afford counsel should be provided with counsel at no cost. Lawyers should have unhindered access to their clients in detention facilities; · Nongovernmental organizations that provide legal assistance and representatives from UNHCR should have unhindered access to all detention facilities for foreigners; · Migrants awaiting deportation and asylum seekers in detention should be housed in facilities separate from persons in custody for violations of Greece's penal laws;   Monitoring · Detention facilities for foreigners should be subject to inspection by a domestic authority independent of the Ministry of Public Order; · Independent nongovernmental organizations should be granted access to detention facilities in order to ensure that conditions therein comport with international and regional standards; · All past reports regarding monitoring visits by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT) should be made public, in particular the report of the ECPT's November 1999 visit during which the committee focused specifically on detention facilities for foreigners (including Alexandras Avenue). The government should implement immediately the ECPT's recommendations regarding detention conditions for foreigners and cooperate in full with the ECPT's planned follow-up visit in 2001; · Greece's report to the U.N. Committee Against Torture (CAT)-scheduled for review in April-May 2001-should include input from nongovernmental organizations; adequately reflect the conditions of detention for foreigners; answer criticism by international organizations, regional bodies, and nongovernmental organizations regarding detention conditions; and include concrete short, medium, and long term measures for the alleviation of detention conditions in violation of Greece's international and regional obligations. Greece should make every effort to submit the report on time; · Greece's report to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)-scheduled for review in January 2001-should detail the measures Greece has taken to combat discrimination against migrants and refugees in the administration of justice. The report should include input from nongovernmental organizations; · Greece should grant permission to the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions to visit Greece in 2001 and inspect detention facilities for foreigners in recognition of the working group's extended mandate to cover the issue of administrative custody of migrants and asylum seekers.   United Nations · The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions should plan a site visit to Greece in 2001 in furtherance of its 1997 mandate expansion to include the administrative detention of migrants and asylum seekers; · The U.N. Committee Against Torture (CAT) should evaluate Greece's upcoming report (April-May 2001) in light of criticism from international and domestic nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations at the regional level, that condemn the government for conditions of detention for foreigners in Greece. The CAT should urge the Greek government in its concluding observations to take short, medium, and long term measures to bring Greece into conformity with international standards regarding the treatment of foreign detainees; · The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) should evaluate Greece's report (scheduled for review in January 2001) with an eye toward discrimination against migrants and refugees in the administration of justice.   Council of Europe · The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT) should encourage the Greek government to publish all past reports of ECPT monitoring visits, in particular the November 1999 report on conditions of detention for foreigners. If the Greek government has not yet responded to the report of the November 1999 visit, the ECPT should demand an immediate response to its findings; · The ECPT's scheduled 2001 visit to Greece should include follow-up inspections of detention facilities for foreigners and an evaluation of the progress (or lack thereof) made by Greece in improving detention conditions since the ECPT's November 1999 visit.   European Union · Discussions at the European Union level on migration and asylum within the Tampere framework-recently fortified by European Commission communications on """"A Community Immigration Policy"""" and """"Towards a Common Asylum Procedure"""" issued in November 2000-must take into consideration the negative side-effects of combating illegal migration. These effects-including member states' failure to comply with international and regional standards for the treatment of undocumented migrants in the administration of justice; the erosion and violations of the international refugee protection regime, as a result of restrictive immigration policies; racist and xenophobic discourse at the political level; and racist and xenophobic violence at the community level-must be addressed by the establishment of a concrete action plan by the E.U. to combat human rights violations against vulnerable migrant populations, refugees and asylum seekers. · The European Council as a matter of urgency should commission a report on the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in detention throughout the European Union and make concrete recommendations to member states regarding their obligations under regional agreements to protect the human rights of vulnerable migrants. Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) · The OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), together with its advisory panel of experts on the prevention of torture, should develop guidelines on the conditions and length of detention of foreigners in OSCE member states; · The OSCE should include conditions of administrative detention of foreigners among the topics for its 2001 supplementary human dimension implementation meetings.

The memorandum was written by Julia Hall and edited by Rachel Denber, acting executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division; Elizabeth Andersen, advocacy director for the Europe and Central Asia Division; Rachael Reilly, refugee policy program director; Michael McClintock, deputy program director; and Dinah PoKempner, general counsel. Technical assistance was provided by Rachel Bien, associate in the Europe and Central Asia Division. Greek translation was provided by Caroline Cunliffe. Human Rights Watch would like to thank the following individuals and groups for their assistance with detention-related issues in Greece: Ecumenical Refugee Program, Andrea Gilbert, Greek Council for Refugees, Greek Helsinki Monitor, Maria Kossida, Nikos Koulouris, Office of the Greek Ombudsman, UNHCR Athens, and Youth Against Racism-Europe. Human Rights Watch acknowledges the generous cooperation of the Ministry of Public Order of the Greek Government and police officials at the Alexandras Avenue detention center. Many thanks, in particular, to the migrants and asylum seekers who spoke with Human Rights Watch in Greece. 1 The police officials included Colonel Metropolous, head of the division for foreigners in the Attica prefecture; Captain Kalianiotis, rotating officer in charge of personnel for the division; and Captain Matakia, in charge of the daily operations of the detention facility. When we refer to """"police authorities"""" in this memorandum, it is to the collective responses of this group. Human Rights Watch acknowledges the full cooperation of the police authorities-including the provision of interpreters for meeting with officials-and in particular Nikolaos Tassiopoulos, Police Brigadier General, Ministry of Public Order, who granted us permission to visit detention facilities and made staff there available to us.  Human Rights Watch also visited the Piraeus Holding Centre for Aliens on November 9, 2000. We did not have access to cells but interviewed detainees. Detainees complained of serious overcrowding, malnutrition, poor hygiene, lack of access to medical care and regular exercise. We also spoke with detainees who had been held at the Menidi detention facility. They complained of severe overcrowding that resulted in detainees taking turns sleeping, one small meal per day, unsanitary conditions, and no access to medical care. A staff member at the Ecumenical Refugee Program in Athens described the conditions of detention she found at the Kolonos Police Station in Athens: Bathroom use is restricted, there are no baths, detainees sleep on the ground, deportees are kept with the general population, there is no hot water, the police mistreat deportees-they are racist-and there is disease. Human Rights Watch interview, Athens, November 7, 2000. Several persons who had been held in more than one detention center for foreigners told Human Rights Watch that the conditions at Alexandras Avenue are the best in the detention regime. Local nongovernmental organizations and Greek lawyers concurred that conditions in other facilities were worse. See also, Amnesty International, Greece: Inhuman Conditions in Drapetsona, Athens, EUR 25/043/1998, 14 August 1998, which charged that the conditions of detention at Drapetsona, a detention center for foreigners, amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  Law No. 1975/1991 is catch-all legislation dealing with foreigners in Greece. It is colloquially referred to as the """"law on foreigners"""" and contains, among other things, the requirements of legal entry/exit, employment, expulsion, and determination of refugee status. A new bill dealing with immigration and the status of foreigners is currently under consideration by the Greek parliament.  Two Greeks were reportedly detained in this center. They did not speak with us but other detainees told Human Rights Watch that they were """"criminals.""""  Afedh Bouzaeiene, a thirty-five year old Tunisian detainee, told Human Rights Watch that his employer withheld most of his wages from agricultural work since 1990. Bouzaeiene's employer told him that he would keep his wages for him until he returned to Tunisia. When he demanded his wages, the employer reported him as an undocumented migrant to the police. Bouzaeiene claimed that one police official was a member of his employer's family and that this relationship facilitated his entry into detention. A Pakistani detainee, Ahmad Shehu, worked as a seafarer. After two years without pay, he demanded his wages from his employer who called the police. Shehu ended up in Alexandras Avenue.  An Information Bulletin for Foreigners/Aliens Being Detained for Deportation is posted in the center and is available in the following languages: Albanian, Arabic, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Turkish. There is no information in the bulletin regarding interpretation for detainees who do not speak one of the languages listed above or who are not able to read. The Bulletin is reproduced in appendix I.  Human Rights Watch interview with a staff person at the Ecumenical Refugee Program, Athens, November 7, 2000.  Maria Kossida, a lawyer who represents deportees and asylum seekers, told Human Rights Watch that successfully challenging deportation orders is """"a practical non-reality"""" and that, for many detainees, applying for asylum is the only option to deportation. Human Rights Watch interview, December 7, 2000. Susannah Verney, senior investigator with the Office of the Greek Ombudsman, concurred, stating that """"nobody challenges the orders"""" due to practical considerations. Human Rights Watch interview, December 7, 2000.  Interpreters provided by the police were used only for meetings with police officials.  In a 1993 report on its visit to the Alexandras Avenue facility, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT), stated that housing ten persons in one of the detention center's rooms would be """"grossly excessive."""" Report to the Government of Greece Carried Out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT Report) from 14 to 26 March 1993, CPT/Inf (94) 20 [EN], 29 November 1994, para. 56. The report from the ECPT's visit to Greece in October/November 1999-focusing specifically on the conditions of detention for foreigners awaiting deportation-has not been made public by the Greek government.  Two long corridors abut the end of each individual room. The inner corridor serves as living space for overflow detainees who cannot fit into individual rooms. The outer corridor is a passageway that allows the police to see into the rooms through bars that comprise the outer wall of each room. 12 Human Rights Watch interview, November 18, 2000. The Information Bulletin for Foreigners/Aliens Being Detained for Deportation, posted in the center, states that detainees """"have the right...[t]o request an examination, if you have a health problem, by a doctor provided by the police, but also, if you wish, by a doctor of your choice at your own expense."""" See appendix I.  General depression appeared to be pervasive throughout the detainee population. In addition to the two serious cases of apparent mental illness noted above, numerous detainees remained in bed during our visit; awake but listless.  Christodolous Tsakirellis, a volunteer lawyer for undocumented migrants, told Human Rights Watch that the Athens lawyers association-the equivalent of the local bar association-provides some pro bono representation but there is no legal aid. Human Rights Watch interview, Athens, November 3, 2000.  Human Rights Watch interview with Maria Stavropoulou, Protection Officer, UNHCR, Athens, November 16, 2000.  The Bulletin does not address all the rights of detainees but it appears to be the only piece of information to which detainees have access.  Human Rights Watch interview with Maria Kossida, Athens, November 15, 2000. 18 Human Rights Watch interview, Alexandras Avenue detention center, November 10, 2000. Human Rights Watch gained access to the detention center on this date upon the intervention of Anna Karamanou, MEP. Karamanou faxed an urgent letter upon our request to police authorities on the morning of November 10 seeking permission for Human Rights Watch to interview Nimal Rathnayke. Upon arrival our researchers were at first denied access (despite the authorities' acknowledgment of the Karamanou letter) and only after phoning the Ministry of Public Order was accessed granted.  Ibid.  Another Sri Lankan detainee witnessed some of the abuse upon Rathnayke's return to the detention center. He phoned a local nongovernmental organization, Youth Against Racism-Europe (YAR), seeking assistance. An activist with YAR contacted Human Rights Watch the evening the beating occurred, accompanied our researchers to the detention center the following day, and provided interpretation for exchanges between police officials and Human Rights Watch.

Human Rights Watch interview, Athens, November 16, 2000.  Human Rights Watch met with the Minister of Public Order Michalis Chrosochoidis on November 17, 2000, the day before permission was granted to visit Alexandras Avenue. He responded to our detention center concerns by stating that a new building would be """"soon"""" be built. 26 According to Nigel Rodley, subsequently named U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture: Although not every rule may constitute a legal obligation, it is reasonably clear that the Standard Minimum Rules can provide guidance in interpreting the general rule against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Thus, serious non-compliance with some rules or widespread non-compliance with some others may well result in a level of ill-treatment sufficient to constitute violation of the general rule. The SMR [Standard Minimum Rules] can provide similar guidance in interpreting the general requirement of Covenant article 10(1) of humane treatment and respect for human dignity..."""" From Nigel Rodley, The Treatment of Prisoners Under International Law, (Oxford University Press: New York, 1987), p. 222. Greece has ratified the ICCPR and the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The 1993 ECPT report on Greece noted that detainees had been held """"in excess of one month, and a few had been there for over three months."""" The committee concluded that such a situation is not acceptable"""" as the """"physical surroundings and regime are quite unsuitable for such lengthy stays."""" CPT, """"1993 Report to the Government of Greece,"""" fn. 10. The ECPT's Annual General Report of 1996 included a special section on foreign nationals detained under aliens legislation. The report concluded: CPT delegations have found immigration detainees held in police stations for prolonged periods (for weeks and, in certain cases, months), subject to mediocre material conditions of detention, deprived of any form of activity and on occasion obliged to share cells with criminal suspects. Such a situation is indefensible. The CPT recognises that, in the very nature of things, immigration detainees may have to spend some time in an ordinary police detention facility. However, conditions in police stations will frequently-if not invariably-be inadequate for prolonged periods of detention. Consequently, the period of time spent by immigration detainees in such establishments should be kept to the absolute minimum. 7th General Report on the CPT's Activities Covering the Period 1 January to 31 December 1996, CPT/Inf (97) 10 [EN], 22 August 1997, para. 27. 28 United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, E/CN.4/2000/4, 28 December 1999, Annex II, Deliberation No.5 (Situation Regarding Immigrants and Asylum Seekers), page 26.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/20/election-violence-abidjan","Election Violence in Abidjan","Election Violence in Abidjan","October 24-26, 2000","12/20/2000","BackgroundSummary of FindingsTestimonies &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCase #1 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCase #2 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCase #3: Agban Gendarmerie Camp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCase #4: Police Academy of CocodyRecommendations &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the new government of the Ivory Coast &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the international donor community and especially to France  Background  On October 22, 2000, presidential elections were held in the Ivory Coast. In a bid to eliminate political rivals from the presidential race, military dictator General Robert Guei fomented ethnic and religious mistrust, and questioned opposition leader Alassane Ouattara's nationality, barring him from running in elections. Ouattara, who heads the Rally of Republicans party (RDR), draws heavily on support from the largely Muslim north.   After early election results showed that the other major opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) headed by Laurent Gbagbo, leading in the polls, General Guei dissolved the National Electoral Commission and proclaimed himself the winner. On October 24, tens of thousands of protesters from several political parties took to the streets and descended on the city center. On October 25, after the military and police abandoned him, General Guei fled the country and Gbagbo declared himself president.   The next day, Ouattara's supporters from the RDR took to the streets again, setting up barricades and burning tires, and demanded fresh elections on the grounds that Ouattara and other candidates had been barred from running. While the military stayed in their barracks, the paramilitary gendarmerie and police aggressively prevented RDR protestors from demonstrating. In many cases, paramilitary gendarmes and police actively sided with FPI mobs, and in a few cases, even conducted joint patrols and operations with FPI supporters. The bloody clashes which ensued were characterized by religious and ethnic tensions between mostly Muslim northerners who largely support the RDR and security forces and civilians supporting Gbagbo, a Christian from the South.  Summary of Findings  A Human Rights Watch fact-finding mission in Abidjan in the aftermath of the presidential elections found that violence was perpetrated against civilians by all sides in Abidjan between October 24 and October 26, 2000. Human Rights Watch uncovered overwhelming evidence of state-sponsored human rights violations, with a clear ethnic and religious focus.   In the days following the October 22, 2000 presidential elections, political, ethnic, and religious violence resulted in the deaths of more than 150 people and injuries to hundreds more. In Abidjan alone, state security forces gunned down political protesters in the streets and rounded up civilians, later executing them in ditches, fields, and within a Gendarmerie base. The bodies of fifty-seven young men were found in a mass grave, at least eighteen more were found floating in a lagoon, and seven more were found slaughtered near a bus roundabout. Hundreds of political activists and foreigners - and Ivorians whose nationality was questioned - were detained and tortured by security forces and scores of these unacknowledged detainees later """"disappeared."""" Supporters from two major political parties, the FPI and the RDR attacked each other and in a several cases burned, shot or hacked to death those thought to be from opposite parties. Several mosques and churches were also attacked.   On October 24 and 25, tens of thousands of demonstrators, primarily from Laurent Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and Alassane Ouattara's Rally of Republicans (RDR), took to the streets to protest President General Robert Guei's annulment of the election. As they descended upon the city center, the elite Presidential Guard and other military forces loyal to General Guei opened fire directly into the crowds with little or no warning. The FPI estimated that some sixty protesters were killed.   On October 24 the Red Brigade, a special unit within the Presidential Guard, fired on protesters on their way into Abidjan's central Plateau District as they attempted to cross over a bridge, and after they had jumped into the lagoon to escape the gunfire. Many drowned and others were shot as they attempted to cross to safety in boats. As tension mounted over opposition to General Guei, several hundred protesters, mostly from the FPI, were rounded up and detained within the Presidential Palace. Many were beaten and several were tortured there, including a pregnant woman. Numerous civilians were killed and injured when jeeps used by the Red Brigade drove directly into crowds. At least two FPI supporters were killed after two grenades or small mortars were fired into a crowd of protesters.   On October 26, after General Guei fled the country, the state-sponsored violence of the previous two days intensified and developed a clear ethnic and religious focus. The primary perpetrators were paramilitary gendarmes and police, and the violence was principally aimed at supporters of Alassane Ouattara's RDR party. Ouattara supporters, mostly from the Muslim north, flooded into the streets to demand an annulment of the election in which General Guei had barred Ouattara from running. As RDR supporters attempted to converge on the National Television Station, they were gunned down in the street, rounded up by gendarmes and police, and openly attacked by mobs of supporters of Gbagbo's FPI armed with machetes, knifes, rocks and iron bars.   Much of the killing by the gendarmes took place after one of their lieutenants was killed while patrolling through the """"Derrier Rai"""" neighborhood of Abobo, a suburb of Abidjan. After the news of his death spread, gendarmes went on a killing spree in Abobo, hunting down Muslims, foreigners, and young men from the northern Diola tribe. The gendarmes shot thirty to forty young men previously detained within Abobo's Camp Commando, and then rounded up eleven to thirteen other Diola men for use as porters to load the dead and dying onto a truck. After dumping the bodies in a forest on the outskirts of Abidjan, the porters and other witnesses still alive were also killed according to survivors. There were at least two other massacres in the """"Derrier Rai,"""" of five (while seven were gunned down, two survived) and thirteen men respectively. The victims, who were dragged from their homes or detained while walking home from work or visiting friends, were beaten and in some cases stripped before being shot. The gunmen later took away the bodies of the thirteen men.   According to victims, the gendarmes and police, many in civilian dress, captured, detained, and in some cases tortured hundreds of RDR protesters. The detainees were predominantly Ivorians from the northern Diola tribe and other Muslim Ivorians seized indiscriminately with foreigners from Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and other countries. None of those interviewed reported having been formally arrested or interrogated. Many of those detained said they were not politically active, and all were detained exclusively and expressly on the basis of tribe, religion, or their real or imputed foreign origins or nationality.   After being detained or seized in roundups, they were transferred to one of several camps, including facilities at the Police Academy of Cocody, the Agban Gendarmerie Camp, Abobo's Camp Commando, the Gendarmerie of Koumassi, or the Gendarmerie of Yopougon. Former detainees described how scores of foreigners were held and separated by nationality at the Police Academy in Cocody.   Police and gendarmes beat the detainees at the academy with ropes, belts, iron bars, sticks, and branches; burned them with cigarettes or pieces of burning plastic or clothing; doused them with cold water and forced to swim in dirty open sewers; forced them to walk back and forth on their knees; made them lie down and look into the sun; tear-gassed them in close quarters and sprayed their eyes, mouth, and genitals with mace; and forced them to fight with each other. The beatings resulted in broken ribs and fingers, concussions and open and often deep head and body wounds. In two detention centers, older Muslim men were forced to pull out their facial hair. Many of those in detention were repeatedly threatened with death and a few were subjected to mock executions.   Although Human Rights Watch could not confirm any cases of rape, there were serious cases of sexual violence against both men and women, most often perpetrated by members of the paramilitary gendarmes. Women were detained in significantly fewer numbers than men, but most of those in detention were beaten and in some cases sexually humiliated and abused. There were some ten women held in Agban Gendarmerie Camp, at least five in the Police Academy of Cocody, and at least ten, mostly FPI supporters, detained by the army within the Presidential Palace. In Agban Gendarmerie Camp several women were stripped naked, beaten, ordered to spread their legs, and threatened with sexual abuse with branches of an acacia tree. At least five male prisoners said they were ordered to get an erection in order to rape woman detainees. When unable to do so, they were struck repeatedly with a belt buckle on their genitals. Former detainees said that in the Yopougon Gendarmerie at least one man was led around by a string tied to his penis. Women detained in Agban and the Presidential Palace were forcefully pulled around the room by their breasts in full view of other detainees. Nurses and doctors treating the RDR wounded confirmed treating several men whose genitals had been injured while in detention.   Human Rights Watch documented at least twenty cases of Ivorians and foreigners detained by gendarmes and police have at this writing yet to be found. In Abobo, nine young Diola men, many from the same extended family, were captured by police and taken away in a public transport vehicle. In Treichville, a wounded man was discharged from a hospital and never returned home, and in Derrier Rai a young man was dragged from his home and has not been seen again. Morgue attendants and hospital workers described family members searching for their loved ones throughout the month of November.   Human Rights Watch cannot pinpoint where command responsibility lies in the police and gendarme hierarchy. Victims described clearly the presence of officers who appeared to be in command of operations in which serious abuses were committed. However, they also described signs of a breakdown of command, such as officers and soldiers arguing with each other over whether certain abuses should be committed, or soldiers committing abuses after more senior officers had left. In several detention facilities, victims described being abused by gendarmes and police who brutalized them at random, but were occasionally stopped by more senior officers when the abuse went too far.   There appeared to be a well-coordinated gendarme operation on the morning of October 26 to deter RDR supporters from marching. During this operation, gendarmes fired upon and killed demonstrators in several different neighborhoods of Abidjan. Mostly RDR supporters and foreigners were rounded up and detained in at least five different Gendarme Bases. Once in detention, victims describe the presence of officers overseeing and directing the abuse and in some cases torture. In the Police Academy of Cocody, victims described being beaten and tortured by lower ranking policemen and officers, as well as by cadets.   While the shooting of thirty to forty detainees within the Camp Commando of Abobo might have been a spontaneous reaction by two or more gendarmes to the killing of their officer, the operation to capture porters to carry the dead and wounded, and subsequent operations to dispose of the dead in the forest at Banco showed signs of being a well-planned operation. Survivors describe the presence of one truck, two jeeps, and the involvement of some thirty gendarmes in this operation. According to victims and witnesses, the killing, particularly in Abobo, and torture within the Agban Gendarmerie camp, intensified considerably after the killing of the gendarme officer.   Throughout the election period, supporters of both the RDR and FPI had been united in their opposition to General Guei. However, on October 26, the day after Gbagbo declared himself president, Ouattara's supporters took to the streets, set up barricades and burned tires to demand new elections in which their leader could participate. While the military stayed in their barracks, the paramilitary gendarme and police launched operations to aggressively impede RDR militants from demonstrating. In many cases, paramilitary gendarmes and police actively sided with FPI mobs. In a few cases the state actors even conducted joint patrols and operations with FPI supporters. With militants from both sides armed with wooden sticks, iron bars, broken bottles, rocks and in a few cases hunting and automatic rifles, the RDR protests turned into pitched battles. This in turn degenerated into ethnic and religiously motivated mob violence.   Reports differ on the number of civilians killed and wounded in Abidjan during the election violence. The government of Ivory Coast says at least 164 people were killed during election violence in Abidjan alone. The FPI claims sixty of its supporters were killed in demonstrations on Oct. 24 and 25, and the RDR maintains 155 of its supporters were killed countrywide. The RDR claims to have treated 316 wounded individuals, mostly RDR, and in Abidjan the Ivorian Red Cross evacuated and/or treated 291 persons.  Testimonies  Case #1   A twenty-one year-old man detained by paramilitary gendarmes on October 26 and later taken to the Camp Commando of Abobo tells how he witnessed the killing of some thirty other detainees inside the camp and was later taken to a forest on the outskirts of Abidjan where approximately fifteen were killed. He tells his story:  I'm an RDR party member and activist. On Thursday morning, October 26 at around 8:00 am I left my home in Abobo to participate in a pro-RDR march to protest the results of the elections. But near the Abobo Cultural Center we met up with a group of gendarmes. I was detained with about 20 other RDR militants. They didn't ask for our ID's. We were beaten really severely right there. From there we were taken on foot to a truck and from there to the Camp Commando of Abobo. As we entered Camp Commando at around 10:00 AM, one of them said, """"say your last prayers."""" When we arrived, there were already eight or nine other people detained. I could see they'd been beaten, badly beaten. Over the next minutes and hours several more groups were brought in. Almost all of us were Diola. In Camp Commando I ran into a friend of mine, S., and he told me he'd been arrested while walking by Camp Commando. He explained that after stopping him they'd asked him for his ID and when they saw he was a Diola, he was arrested on the spot. There were two adolescents; one was a student, still in school uniform about thirteen or fourteen and another, a youth from Benin around fifteen. They started beating us from the moment we got off the truck. They ordered us to lie down and whipped us with their red belts. At one point they threw a bucket of water mixed with some kind of burning pepper in it and people screamed from the pain it caused as it went into the open wounds. Then at around 1:00 pm they allowed us to sit up and then again told us to lie on our backs and face the sun. Another torture was when they threw tear gas at us and refused to allow us to move. There were about five gendarmes immediately around us, and others milling about. Then at around 3:00-3:30 (it was just after the afternoon call to prayer which we could hear from a nearby mosque) I heard a siren and saw a car coming into the main entrance to the camp. A few gendarmes got out of the car and started yelling and shouting and crying. Then one of the gendarmes in blue just started shooting us. First he shot three newly arrested people with a pistol. It happened less than five meters from where I was sitting.  Then a few other gendarmes started shooting at us. They were yelling in a sobbing, angry way. They were in fits of emotion. One of them said, """"We're going to kill you all; if our people are going to die then we'll kill you."""" As they were shooting I lay down and pretended I was dead. The youth from Benin was hit and lay just on top of me and was just crying, """"Forgive me, have mercy on me."""" I could see my friend S. had been hit on the leg, throat and chest. And then [a gendarme] standing several meters away said, """"Oh so you're not all dead"""" and I tried to pretend I was dead.  We all lay there, people dying were breathing heavily. I could hear a boy from Benin saying in a soft voice, """"Give me water, I'm so thirsty, bring me water."""" After the shooting there were about thirty dead or almost dead, and more seriously wounded. Then about ten lightly injured.  Then about an hour or a little more later a new group of prisoners were brought in. Then those prisoners and those of us who weren't wounded, were ordered to load up the bodies onto a big blue truck. I loaded one person on the truck and then just stayed there trying not to be noticed.  Then at around 6:00 pm we took off. There were about fifteen gendarmes in our truck. They were dressed in full commando uniform and several had bandoleers wound around their wrists.  We headed north towards the Yopougon Prison and those of us still alive started talking to each other in whispers wondering if they were going to kill us or take us to the prison [in Yopougon]. But mostly we were just silent. There were about thirty to forty gendarmes in total participating in the operation.  Then we got to the place. We were terrified. Then they ordered us to unload the bodies. Since I was in the back of the truck I tried to stay there for as long as I possibly could. Then they ordered us to come and sit next to the dead and dying. Several of us were lying down trying to pretend we were dead but I was lucky because I had laid down first and then two others laid on top of me. It seemed like the dead had been separated from the wounded - maybe to make killing the survivors easier. I remember hearing them talking to each other saying, """"Why is it only now you Northerners are protesting the election results; three weeks ago you didn't say anything. Now that the General is gone and Gbagbo is a civilian that you think you can take over."""" Then several of them, I couldn't really count, took up formation in front of us, we heard them loading their guns and the firing started. The boy on top of me received a lot of bullets. He screamed when he was hit and then started groaning and breathing heavily.  After a few minutes of firing, a few of them went around finishing people off. Then they walked near where I was and stopped, noticing the boy lying on top of me was still breathing. I was trying desperately to control my breathing so they wouldn't notice me. It was when they were finishing him off that I was hit. [He was wounded once in the arm.]  Then I heard one of them saying, """"Let's burn all the bodies,"""" and another said, """"No, they're all dead."""" And then I heard the truck and jeeps leaving. I lay there, and after a few minutes saw someone get up from the pile of bodies. There were a few more who started saying, """"Help us, help us."""" But they were dying and fell silent shortly after. Case #2  Nine men, several from the same extended family, were detained on October 26 by persons whom they thought were the police, and have yet to be accounted for. It is the most serious case of disappearance documented by Human Rights Watch. None of the security forces have acknowledged detaining the men. One of the witnesses, the wife of one of the victims, described the detention:  I am the wife of S. We have a four-year-old child and I'm nine months pregnant with our second. My husband is Ivorian as are all of those taken that day. They weren't involved in politics; most of them are long distance truck drivers and didn't have time for that. We are one of few Diola families living within our immediate area; there are Baoules, Betes and Agnis around us. Maybe that's why they targeted us. The whole thing happened in less than five minutes. It was around 3:40 pm on October 26. I heard a knock on the door to the compound, and we heard them say, """"It's the police and if you don't open, we'll kill you all."""" Then my husband opened the door and eight of them stormed into the family compound. Some were in t-shirts and jeans and others were in combats. There was a handicapped man in one of the rooms in the compound and when his children started crying, the boss said he should be left alone. He was the only man they left. Then our men were ordered to move out of the house and we [the wives] started crying and begging them to leave our husbands. One of them pushed me, but another said, """"she's innocent - leave her."""" As they were taking them we heard them saying, """"The Diola must stop following Alassane we'll finish them all, he's doing you wrong; if it weren't for him the Diola would be ok.""""  Outside we saw there was a mini-bus and I saw what I think were three other prisoners inside. A few of them were bleeding. I wouldn't leave my husband and followed him as he and the others were being led outside. I asked, """"Why are you taking them, what have they done?"""" And one of them said, """"You people are Diola, just wait and see what we'll do to you."""" Another who spoke Diola said, """"Don't worry, we'll make them suffer a little and then bring them back."""" They beat them as they were getting into a mini-bus. I was crying and held on to the back of it and begged them to tell me where they were being taken, but one of the police pushed me hard and I almost fell on the ground and said I asked too many questions. Case #3: Agban Gendarmerie Camp  Some of the worst examples of physical and psychological torture occurred within the Agban Gendarmerie Camp in which some 100 - 200 Diola youths, RDR supporters and foreigners were held. Most victims were released within forty-eight hours of capture. A twenty-year-old tailor described what happened to him. Over twenty bruises, burns and small wounds on his head and body were clearly visible to Human Rights Watch researchers.  On October 26, I was participating in a march with other RDR militants when I was detained with five other guys. We were detained by about ten gendarmes who beat us with their red-rope belts as we walked the twenty meters to Agban camp. After reaching the camp they made us swim in the gutter, which was full of dirty water, broken bottles, human feces and garbage. One of them forced my head under the half-meter water. As we moved through the gutter, gendarmes were lined up and beat us as we moved by. Some were threatening to kill us and others were hitting us hard on the head with the butt of their rifles. Then, they told us to take our clothes off and forced us to walk on our knees for over twenty meters. Then they continued beating us and one of them hit my penis with the hook on his red belt. It was so painful, it was bleeding and I started screaming. One of them said, """"Oh if we've hurt you there, don't worry, we have doctors here,"""" then he called another gendarme who sprayed a little can of what I think was tear gas on my penis, nose and eyes. At this point I almost lost consciousness. Entering Camp Agban I saw about a hundred other prisoners. New people kept coming all the time in groups of two, three, five. We tried to sit down but there were so many of us it was hard to all sit at the same time. They didn't ask us any questions. They spoke of Alassane, of the RDR; they made us all say """"Alassane is a Mousi"""" (Burkinabe) and made us sing the national anthem. Then the beatings started again. They beat us using their belts, wooden sticks and iron bars. At one point they took our clothes, which were in a pile outside the entrance, put them on fire and went around dripping it on our legs and backs. They picked clothes with plastic in it - like sport suits because they burned better. Case #4: Police Academy of Cocody   Throughout the day on October 26 and to a lesser extent on October 27, an estimated 400 - 500 mostly RDR supporters, northerners and foreigners were brought into the Police Academy in Cocody. Some detainees were arrested seemingly at random on the street; others were detained while participating in pro-RDR demonstrations and herded into police jeep and trucks. Victims describe being severely beaten, tortured and deprived of food and water for up to six days.   A nineteen-year old student was stopped by the police in Abobo while walking with a friend. After the police determined he was from the northern Diola tribe, he was detained for six days within the Police Academy. The deep, open sore on his knees and numerous lacerations on his head and back were clearly visible. He described his experience:  The police forced us to go with them after finding out we were Diola. They were arresting others and by the time we reached the police precinct, we were already eight or ten, all men. They searched us, stealing our money, then made us undress and then put us in police cells. They called us out two by two to write down our names and those who had RDR cards were more severely beaten. There were a few Malian and Guineans among us but they lied and said they were Ivorians. While we were there other people continued to be brought in until we were around twenty - all men. Then around 3:00 or 4:00 pm they let us get dressed, put us all in a truck and told us they were taking us to the Police Academy. As we were going, the police started telling us they were going to kill us there. Upon arrival, the police started beating us. As we were there, more and more people started arriving and by 9:00 pm or so there were about 300 people. Each time they came in someone would write down their name. On Friday morning they asked the foreigners to separate from the Ivorians. I could see there were a lot: over 100 Malians and about eighty from Burkina Faso and sixty to eighty from Guinea. They kept the ones from Nigeria and Niger together.  I stayed in for several days and was beaten by many policemen and student policemen.  We were all in one big room and they tortured us in many ways. First were the constant beatings; with batons, iron bars, wood, cut branches from trees around the compound. The police kept waking us up by throwing cold water on us. Then they had us - two by two - crawl a distance on our knees and the one who arrived last was beaten. They'd put two of us together and order us to fight - and if they say we're faking, they beat us up. Sometimes they stood on our backs asked us to tell them how heavy they were.  There were about five women inside (they weren't naked) and the police told them to play with the genitals of several men until they got an erection. When the men couldn't do it the police beat them. Then they asked them to dance close with the women.  I don't think anyone died in custody but I saw a good number of people who'd lost consciousness and people who couldn't stand anymore and so many of us were bleeding and cut all over. Thursday and Friday were the worst days for beating.  They made us chant """"Alassane is Mousi"""" and """"Gbagbo President."""" On Friday some of the police were talking about a gendarme who had been killed and then on Saturday, a few police brought in a newspaper with the news and pictures of the Youpogon massacre and said, """"This is the way you should've been killed... but you're lucky you're brought to police academy."""" Others even said, """"This is the way you'll be killed as well.""""  I finally got out when my friend's mother paid 4,000 CFA [approximately $5.46 USD] each for our freedom. Most of the parents were doing that. By that time it was a way of making money off of us. Recommendations  The response of the international community before, during, and after the killings and other serious human rights violations in Ivory Coast has been grossly inadequate. Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the government of Ivory Coast, the international community, and the United Nations:  To the new government of the Ivory Coast: Immediately take all possible measures to halt the excessive use of force by all security personnel; establish safeguards to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of persons in detention; and curb ethnic and religious violence and violence against foreigners. Publicly acknowledge and condemn the unlawful killings and abuse of peaceful demonstrators and members of the opposition. Suspend from active duty, investigate, and prosecute members of the police and gendarmes accused of torture and ill treatment, including sexual abuse; unlawful detention and """"disappearance;"""" and unlawful killings. Provide, as expeditiously as possible, information and aid required by public and private investigations of human rights abuses.  Provide immediate assistance to the U.N. team investigating the October killings and ensure the security of persons providing testimony and information to the U.N. investigative team. Implement the U.N. investigative team's recommendations and present to competent prosecutorial authorities information submitted by the U.N. mission.  To the international donor community and especially to France: Press for accountability for human rights violations in the Ivory Coast that have taken place since October 2000. Make assistance to the Ivorian judiciary a priority once the government of the Ivory Coast fully facilitates the U.N. investigative team and complies with its recommendations. Support Ivorian civil society organizations in their efforts to promote and protect human rights and support freedom of the press in the Ivory Coast.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire","Torture, United Nations"

In an urgent memorandum to the Greek government, the group documented conditions at the Attica General Police Directorate detention center for foreigners.  Last month when the group visited the facility, located on Alexandras Avenue in Athens, it found more than 150 detainees in a space allegedly designed for half that number. Most detainees had been held at the center, which was filthy and roach-infested, for months; one man had been held there for a full year. Such conditions, coupled with the lengthy periods of detention, """"raise serious concerns"""" that the Greek government may be responsible for cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, Human Rights Watch said.  """"The fact that the detainees may not have papers does not mean they do not have rights,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"People are being held in ghastly conditions for long periods of time.""""  The vast majority of the detainees had an administrative deportation order issued against them by the Ministry of Public Order that could not be executed immediately because their home countries could not provide required documentation in a timely manner or would not issue documents to them at all. Some of the detainees were stateless and had no home country that could issue the required documents.  """"The Greek government cannot simply warehouse migrants who cannot be sent back home,"""" said Denber. """"When migrant detainees are held indefinitely and do not know when, if ever, they will be released, their detention becomes arbitrary and that's a violation of international law.""""  A number of detainees had applied for asylum and were waiting for a decision, or had already been rejected. Human Rights Watch argued that asylum seekers, in general, should not be detained.  In addition to making specific recommendations to the Greek government to uphold the rights of undocumented migrants, Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations, Council of Europe, European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Greece, as a member state, complies fully with international and regional standards for the treatment of detainees.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/19/turkey-violent-assault-prison-hunger-strikers","Turkey- Violent Assault on Prison Hunger Strikers","Turkey: Violent Assault on Prison Hunger Strikers","","12/19/2000","Human Rights Watch condemned violent assault by Turkish security forces on hunger striking prisoners. The prisoners were protesting inmate transfers to a new type of high-security prisons.  According to the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, an independent local organization, eighteen inmates in sixteen prisons have been killed--either shot by security forces or burned by self-immolation. The Interior Ministry has stated that prisoners' gunfire killed two gendarmes. Security forces used smoke, gas or percussion grenades and firearms, and also demolition machines to enter the prison wards. """"If the operation was an effort to preserve life, as claimed by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit this morning, it was a terrible failure,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch.  Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry today began transferring inmates from the raided prisons to the first of the new high-security facilities, known as F-type prisons, breaking previous public commitments that they would not take this step precipitately.  The hunger strikers are prisoners convicted or on trial for supporting illegal armed organizations under Turkey's wide-ranging Anti-Terror Law. They are currently in wards holding sixty or more inmates. Turkish authorities claim they aim to remove hunger striking prisoners from intimidatory influence of political organizations.  Hunger striking prisoners have been hospitalized, where it is understood that they are continuing their fast.  Human Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized the use of soldiers to guard prison perimeters and suppress prison protests. Since 1995, Turkish soldiers have beaten, shot or tortured to death twenty-eight prisoners, not counting yesterday's figures. They are not trained for prison work, and may have been involved in the fifteen-year armed conflict in the southeastern provinces; when brought into prisons, they frequently use the opportunity to attack prisoners.  """"These deaths were entirely avoidable,"""" said Sugden. """"The current crisis in Turkish prisons could have been solved with patience, transparency and a readiness to consult. After all this violence, a positive resolution to the death fasts seems more remote than before.""""  F-type prisons introduce solitary or small group isolation for inmates who have traditionally been housed in ward-like facilities. Human Rights Watch has long opposed these facilities. In a report published earlier this year, and in meetings with the Turkish government in May, the international monitoring organization argued that F-type prisons as originally conceived would impose intense and potentially damaging isolation that could amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. For months, Human Rights Watch has called on the Turkish government not to transfer inmates to F-type prisons until the government publicly committed to managing them in line with international standards, and to establishing a monitoring system to ensure that prisoners would not be mistreated. Human Rights Watch cited prolonged isolation as a serious concern.  In June the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited the first of the F-type prisons and recently published preliminary observations emphasizing the need for prisoners to have substantial out-of-cell time, and an opportunity to take part in a range of constructive activities.  Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk's announcement that transfers had begun to the first F-type prison at Sincan, outside Ankara, marked a clear reneging on promises made to those seeking to resolve the impending crisis over the F-type prisons. Throughout the past month, the Justice Minister repeatedly stated that he would make no transfers to the new prisons until alternative proposals from civil society organizations such as the Bar Association and the Turkish Medical Association had been fully considered, and the regulation shaping the regime for the new prisons had been published. None of this has happened, nor did the government adopt a law on the prisons as promised.  Hunger strikers oppose the introduction of cell-based prisons because they fear that they will be subjected to a regime of isolation and may be at increased risk of ill-treatment. Some observers believe that ward-type facilities allow the prisoners to exercise more control over daily life and, through contact with fellow inmates, to continue their political activities. Tough political control among inmates has sometimes extended to """"executing"""" fellow prisoners suspected of acting as informers by strangling or knifing them.  BACKGROUND: The crisis that brought on the 61-day hunger strike was almost entirely of the Justice Ministry's own making. The large ward system, in operation since the beginning of the Turkish republic, had left prison discipline almost completely in the hands of the prisoners. In wards holding prisoners under the Anti-Terror Law this meant that the influence of illegal organizations held sway, but in common criminal wards this neglect resulted in a harsh pecking order, where access to basic needs and privileges depends on physical strength or the ability to pay a bribe. Unfortunately, plans to move away from the ward system were developed over the past decade, more or less in secret, by Justice Ministry officials who resisted consulting with either local and international human rights organizations or intergovernmental bodies working on penal issues. The result was the construction of a series of prisons with a structure which runs directly counter to current thinking about the humane treatment of prisoners.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

His signature on the treaty for the International Criminal Court would signal for the first time firm U.S. support for the most important new human rights institution in 50 years. The International Criminal Court will be a global tribunal to bring to justice those responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. A diplomatic conference in July 1998 adopted a treaty to establish the court. Once 60 governments ratify the treaty, probably by mid-2002, the court will be launched. Already, 120 governments have signed the treaty, indicating an intention to ratify, and 25 have completed ratification. The court's supporters include virtually every U.S. ally. Traditionally, the United States has championed such international institutions of justice. From Nuremberg to the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the United States has supported bringing the world's most heinous human rights criminals to justice. In several speeches, President Clinton has endorsed the International Criminal Court in principle. But the administration has been equivocal on the details. Driven by the Pentagon and its congressional allies, the administration has spent several years trying to guarantee that the court would never prosecute an American. Predictably, diplomats from even our closest allies rolled their eyes at such audacity. Their refusal to embrace this selective vision of justice led Mr. Clinton to withhold his signature from the treaty. The administration fears that America's enemies might launch unwarranted, politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. troops or officials. But to prevent such unfounded prosecutions, the court treaty includes numerous safeguards -- the highest standards of due process, scrutiny of proposed charges by multiple panels of judges, and liberal procedures to remove a prosecutor for misconduct. Most important, any government can deprive the court of jurisdiction over its nationals by conducting its own good-faith investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution. Because the United States vows to prosecute any service member who commits war crimes or other atrocities, the prospect of the court pursuing an American is remote. These safeguards were more than enough for America's allies, but not for the administration. Its fear that the court might not apply these guarantees conscientiously is what led it to try to exempt U.S. citizens altogether from the court's reach, even if prosecution were warranted. As a breach of the principle of equal justice for all, U.S. policy has been wrong. As a tool to protect Americans from unjustified prosecutions, it has now also become counterproductive. Withholding the president's signature from the treaty may have made sense as a bargaining chip in an effort, however misguided, to secure an exemption for Americans or perhaps even to discourage the court's creation. But now, as signatures and ratifications of the treaty rapidly mount, the court is an inevitability. Moreover, through repeated negotiating sessions, the international community has made clear that it will never allow an exemption for Americans. Today, if the administration wants to ensure that the court's safeguards against unjustified prosecutions are conscientiously applied, it should try to shape the court's culture, particularly in this critical, formative stage. As an active participant in the Rwandan and Yugoslav war crimes tribunals, the U.S. government has helped uphold the highest standards of due process. A similar strategy is needed for the court. But the U.S. government will have little influence if it sits on the sidelines and pouts. Ideally, the United States should ratify the court's treaty, but Sen. Jesse Helms, whose assent as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is necessary, has declared any ratification proposal """"dead on arrival."""" Yet Mr. Clinton can sign the treaty without Senate approval, so long as he acts by Dec. 31. That is the last date the treaty permits signature as a step toward ratification rather than completed ratification. No U.S. president will have this opportunity again. Someday, U.S. ratification should still follow. In the meantime, the president's signature, by demonstrating support for the court, would maximize the U.S. government's ability to bolster the professionalism that so far has infused the court's formation. By embracing this landmark institution, it would also put President Clinton on the right side of history.","United States","United Nations, Human Rights Council"

The 62-page report, based on four years of research, details accounts by victims and their families of brutal and systematic torture at the hands of police and security forces. Police use beatings, suffocation, electric shock, rape and other sexual abuse to coerce victims to confess to crimes. Meanwhile, judicial courts routinely admit coerced confessions into evidence, and torturers are seldom, if ever, brought to justice.  """"These are acts of sheer inhumanity,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Uzbek government doesn't investigate or punish the people responsible for them. This can only mean that it condones the use of torture. The international community should make clear that this has serious consequences."""" Roth is in Uzbekistan this week to present the report to Uzbek officials. Torture victims include those arrested for common crimes as well as those accused of political and religious offenses. The mass arrests of those suspected of opposition sentiment based on their religious affiliation, however, have brought to light many instances of torture, often during trials in which defendants have testified about their ill-treatment. Since 1998, the government has arrested thousands of people in a crackdown against those whose practice of Islam falls outside of state-sanctioned religion, often charging them with ill-defined crimes of """"religious extremism."""" Police routinely torture defendants in these cases, not only to obtain confessions but to force them to incriminate others with whom they have prayed or studied the Koran.  Government officials have publicly announced a policy of holding families accountable for the actions of any of their members suspected of illegal religious activity. Consequently, the relatives of those accused or sought are often detained, held as hostages, threatened with torture, or are tortured themselves. The crackdown intensified after the February 1999 bombings of several government buildings in Tashkent, which the government quickly blamed on """"Islamic terrorists."""" Last summer's armed incursions by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan into Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan heightened fears about the region's security. """"The international community is interested in human rights, and in the region's stability, but doesn't necessarily see the link between the two,"""" said Roth. """"Human rights are a fundamental aspect of stability and of Uzbekistan's international commitments. Governments and intergovernmental organizations should make it a top priority to end impunity for torture in Uzbekistan.""""  The Human Rights Watch report includes detailed recommendations to the government of Uzbekistan, to the United Nations and other intergovernmental organizations, the United States, the European Union, and to international financial institutions. The group called on the Clinton administration, which in 2000 certified Uzbekistan as """"committed to observing internationally recognized human rights,"""" to suspend all security assistance pending serious efforts by the government of Uzbekistan to halt the practice of torture. It urged the European Union to consider suspending its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Uzbekistan, should the government fail to take specific steps to improve its human rights record. The report also describes the shortcomings of the Uzbek criminal justice system, which lacks procedural safeguards against police abuse. Detainees do not have the right to appeal the lawfulness of their detention or to protest ill-treatment before a judge until their case goes to court, an egregious violation of international law. They are often held incommunicado. Attorneys must request case investigators for access to their clients or to forensic doctors, who could document evidence of torture; such requests are routinely denied. Custody during investigation and prior to trial is the rule, rather than the exception. """"The international community should pressure the Uzbek government for legal reform that would prevent torture,"""" said Roth. """"But it can't just be reform on paper. There has to be fundamental political change to make it meaningful.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

A victory by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) would finalize the transition of government in Yugoslavia and Serbia that began with the victory of Vojislav Kostunica and the DOS in the September 24, 2000 federal elections and the popular revolt on October 5. The Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) of Slobodan Milosevic, which alone or in a coalition with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) ruled Serbia for the past ten years, effectively lost power in October. In the loosely structured Yugoslav federation (Serbia and Montenegro) most power resides with the two estranged republics, rather than with the federal institutions. Since the federal elections in September, DOS has been a major partner in the federal government, along with the Montenegrin Socialist People's Party. Since October 24, DOS has also shared seats in the Serbian transition government with the SPS and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic. The formation of the transition government in Serbia did not result from any electoral process, but from the obvious loss of legitimacy of the SPS after the September 2000 federal elections and the dramatic events in October. To consolidate its power in Serbia, DOS needs a victory in the December 23 elections for the Serbian parliament. Since losing power in October, the SPS of Slobodan Milosevic is not in a position to manipulate the forthcoming elections, as it did on several occasions during the 1990s. DOS, which does not have the broad ranging power the SPS formerly exercised, has made numerous pledges, both before and after it came to power, that it would not repeat the practices of the SPS, including the abuse of the electoral process. Although its current power is limited, DOS is in a position to facilitate or hinder the smooth progression of the elections. Holding a free and fair election would be an important first step towards promoting human rights and the rule of law in Serbia. As of mid-December, the pre-election campaign has been progressing according to basic standards of fairness. The campaign has been devoid of the intimidation and police violence that marked the September 24 election campaign. State media, though partial to DOS, have provided information so that the electorate can make an objective judgment about the candidates. The electoral law includes new rules that significantly limit the possibility for fraud during the vote and vote-count. Opinion polls conducted in late November and early December found voter support for DOS at about 70 percent, SPS 20 percent, the nationalist SRS 5 percent, and other parties 5 percent. The threshold for awarding parliamentary seats on the basis of proportional representation is 5 percent. SPO is the only other party that might pass the threshold. It will be incumbent on the winning party in the elections to establish the rule of law and to respect human rights. The international community should end the ongoing """"grace period"""" since the transition in October during which states have unconditionally set aside the human rights agenda. Both the Serbian republic and the Yugoslav federal governments in Belgrade should implement, as a matter of urgency, the following changes: Release of the estimated 600 Albanian political prisoners who are still unlawfully detained or convicted after unfair trials; Investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of human rights violations, including killings, abductions, torture, and illegal detentions, committed by forces under the authority of the Serbian Ministry of Interior and other government agencies; Cooperation to the fullest extent with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), including the arrest and transfer to the ICTY of those individuals indicted by the tribunal, as provided for by the ICTY statute; Annulment of the 1998 University Act, which empowers the government to appoint state university boards of governors and other bodies and to control the selection of teachers; Annulment of the Public Information Act of October 1998, which severely curtails free expression; Elimination of the death penalty from the Serbian Penal Code (articles 47 and 169); Amendment of the federal Criminal Procedure Act to provide explicitly for detainees' right to counsel immediately after detention and for law enforcement officers' obligation to inform detainees of their right to counsel; Amendment of the Law on the Armed Forces to reduce the length of civilian service for persons claiming conscientious objector status from a punitive twenty-four months to the regular length of armed service (twelve months), provide for service in civilian institutions, and protect a person's right to raise a conscientious objection to military service after recruitment; Prompt reinstatement of the judges of the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court, and the seventeen judges of district, municipal, and commercial courts who were unlawfully removed in December 1999 and July 2000; Reinstatement of university professors and Radio Television Serbia (RTS) journalists who have been dismissed or sent on compulsory leave in violation of their right to freedom of expression under the previous government. Media coverage DOS politicians have a constant presence in Serbian electronic and print media. The media report extensively on the activities of DOS ministers in the Yugoslav government and the transitional government in Serbia. DOS leaders are frequent guests on programs on major television stations, including RTS. Most local media also cover DOS activities much more than those of other political groupings. The pattern is followed by all newspapers but one—the newly established daily """"24 Casa."""" Government control of the media has changed significantly since the near absolute control exerted by SPS over the state-controlled media. The Serbian Information Ministry is currently managed by representatives of DOS, SRS, and SPO. On the basis of a document formalizing campaign coverage on RTS, which all major parties signed between November 10-20, RTS broadcasts daily pre-election programs during prime-time hours. The daily activities of DOS, SPS, SRS, and SPO are presented fairly on the program. In addition, representatives of the four electoral groupings discuss a variety of issues on evening RTS debates. The Belgrade-based TV Studio B broadcasts lengthy interviews with both DOS and opposition politicians during prime-time hours. TV Palma, a private station whose signal can be received throughout most of Serbia, promotes SRS and SPS on its news program. The independent Television ANEM, whose program is transmitted through a network of local television stations throughout Serbia, also offers space to parties opposed to DOS. None of these options had been available to opposition parties during the September 24 election campaign. To date, the language that the pro-DOS media have used in its reports on the SPS and SRS is neutral and objective—in stark contrast to the vitriolic anti-DOS language used by the same media when they were under firm SPS control. Another encouraging change is the manner in which RTS is broadcasting sessions of the parliament. When SPS had control over RTS, speeches made by opposition members of the Serbian or Yugoslav parliament were broadcast with a voice-over by the announcer. But the speeches of members of parliament from SPS and SRS were covered without interference during the recent two-day broadcast of the session of the Yugoslav parliament (December 7-8). Intimidation and Violence In the transitional period leading to the December elections, the Serbian Ministry of Interior has been led by three co-ministers from DOS, SPS, and SPO. The police apparatus has remained largely intact since the October events. Top officials—who during the 1990s virtually transformed the police into an armed wing of the SPS—and its former coalition partner, JUL, still hold their posts. Since October 5, there have been no reported instances of police engaging in any unlawful activities against political parties or nongovernmental groups. This restraint clearly distinguishes the forthcoming elections from those held in September, which had been preceded by months of police harassment and intimidation of DOS and nongovernmental activists. There have been no reported violent incidents between supporters of the various parties that will participate in the December 23 elections. New Election Law The new Law on the Election of People's Deputies, adopted on October 9, 2000, by the Serbian parliament, has corrected some important shortcomings in the election laws that regulated previous elections. DOS did not directly participate in the enactment of the bill, since it was not in represented in parliament, having boycotted the last parliamentary elections in Serbia in 1997. The bill—adopted five days after the October 5 events and under strong DOS pressure—and the ensuing instructions issued by the Republic Election Commission take into consideration key objections that DOS, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), independent monitors, and human rights groups raised with respect to the previous election legislation. The major changes in the law include provisions for: greater transparency in the production and distribution of ballots; transparent voter registers; safeguards against abuses in vote counting and the delivery of results; voting in the military to be administered by multiparty civilian agencies; and independent election monitoring. The new law, while addressing fair competition among political parties, neglects persons who are not able to vote in person at the polling station. Past laws enabled them to vote by mail or at home, but the new law does not contain provisions for them, thus potentially disfranchising thousands of potential voters. The election law does not ensure representation of ethnic minorities in parliament. The law stipulates a 5 percent threshold for a party to get a seat in parliament. Ethnic Hungarians and Muslims each make up between 3 and 4 percent of the Serbian population. While a major political party representing ethnic Hungarians—the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians—participates in the DOS coalition and will enter the parliament on the DOS list, the leading party representing Muslims in Serbia will not be represented in the parliament. The List for Sandzak party (named after the Sandzak region in southwestern Serbia, populated mainly by Muslims) decided not to participate in the elections because it did not manage to reach an agreement with the DOS about its share of posts on the joint list of candidates. Composition of Electoral Commissions and Polling Boards Under the laws governing the federal elections in September, there were insufficient safeguards protecting the independence of the electoral commissions and polling boards, the bodies organizing and conducting the vote. As a result, they were dominated by the SPS and JUL. The new Serbian election law contains an important ban that did not exist in the federal legislation: """"No political party, coalition or other political organization, can have more than half of the permanent members in the bodies conducting the elections"""" (article 29 (4)). Such a prohibition existed in the previous Serbian law on elections. But as the presidential elections held in autumn 1997 made manifest, the prohibition was undermined by the appointment of non-party individuals who favored the SPS. In December 2000, however, no one political party dominates the government and political life, and thus the prohibition contained in Article 29 (4) is expected to be respected. Serbia as a whole is one election unit, and one electoral commission—the RIK (Republicka Izborna Komisija, or the Republic Election Commission)—organizes and conducts the December 23 elections. The RIK appoints approximately 10,000 polling boards, which conduct the voting at polling stations throughout Serbia. On October 24, the Serbian parliament appointed the president of the RIK, sixteen permanent members, and their deputies. The permanent members are low-profile judges and lawyers with no significant party affiliation, or with affiliations to various political groups. Eight additional members, representing the eight parties and coalitions that are taking part in the elections, are also part of the RIK. There have been no complaints thus far during the campaign that the RIK is favoring any participant in the election. The RIK's operating procedures stipulate that the commission must convene in public, so that its work is transparent. Such a rule is indispensable in light of the experience of the September 24 elections, when the Federal Election Commission held clandestine sessions from which opposition representatives were excluded. The president and three members of the Federal Election Commission were indicted on December 12 for the misuse of their official positions by allegedly attempting to falsify the results of the September 24 elections. Each polling board serving in the December 23 election has a president and three permanent members. They all have deputies. Representatives of the parties contesting the elections join the polling boards during the elections. The aim is to ensure that no party or coalition dominates the work of the polling boards or commits fraud during the voting at the polling station. The new law, like the preceding one, does not clarify whether the party representatives on the polling boards have deputies. Given the deeply rooted mistrust among the participants in the elections, the presence of deputies as observers would be instrumental in strengthening the control during the voting and vote count. Transparency in the Production and Distribution of Ballots Ballots for the December elections are printed in the printing house of the Yugoslav Official Gazette. The law authorizes party representatives to attend the printing, counting, and packing of the ballots, as well as their delivery to the polling stations. A RIK instruction also authorizes representatives of the political parties to """"be present at, or in front of, the premises in which the ballots are deposited."""" The Belgrade-based Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID) announced that its representative had also received permission to attend the printing, as a safeguard against the fraudulent production of additional ballots. The law fails to mandate an obligation for the polling boards to place official watermarks specific to each polling station on the ballots, as they are handed to the voters. Such a provision would strengthen protections against ballot-stuffing. Voter Registers The new bill introduces a requirement that municipal voter registers be connected to an integrated computer system. This change enables interested parties and citizens to identify persons registered in more than one polling station. The possibility of multiple voting by the same person is also reduced by an RIK instruction that stipulates the marking of the voter's finger, as a sign that he or she voted. Possibility for Fraud in Vote Counting The new law provides for transparent ballot boxes at the polling stations. It also stipulates that the voters countersign at the voting register in the polling station before they cast their vote. Previously, the only proof that a person voted was the circle made by a polling board member next to the voter's name. Unscrupulous polling board members were thus in a position to stuff ballots and artificially inflate the number of supposed voters by circling numbers of individuals who did not turn out to vote. The law should mandate that voting results be expressed in words as well as in numerical form. Thus a possibility still exists that, after the counting of the votes, digits could be added to the numbers indicating the vote for a party, as has been documented by the OSCE in Kosovo in the 1996 and 1997 elections. Possibility for Abuses in the Delivery of Results The law does not specify the procedure for the delivery of ballots, voter registration lists, or minutes by the polling boards to the RIK after the votes are counted at the polling station. An RIK instruction, issued on October 30, 2000, authorizes political party representatives to attend the transfer and delivery of the materials by the members of the polling board. This supervision is aimed at preventing forged ballots or data. Lack of Elaborate Rules on Voting by non-Albanians from Kosovo The Kosovo vote has traditionally been the major contentious issue in the elections in Serbia. Although the majority of Kosovo Serbs in recent years voted for the SPS (in the September 2000 elections their support for the SPS was about 70 percent) the party fraudulently inflated the numbers in both the 1997 elections for the president of Serbia (the SPS candidate was Milan Milutinovic) and the September 2000 elections for the president of Yugoslavia (the candidate was Slobodan Milosevic). With the mass displacement of Kosovo Serbs after the end of the 1999 NATO war, accurately tallying the Kosovo Serb vote became more difficult. Almost 200,000 internally displaced persons from Kosovo live in Serbia and Montenegro, and the remaining non-Albanian population in Kosovo is about 100,000. The new legislation does not resolve the issue of their vote. While the 2000 federal law on electoral districts allowed Kosovo voters to cast their votes in two districts of Serbia (Prokuplje and Vranje) that border Kosovo, and at special polling stations in municipalities in other parts of Serbia or in northern parts of Kosovo, the legislation for the December elections fails to address the issue. The RIK should urgently issue instructions to ensure that the displaced persons will be able to vote on the same terms as other Serbian residents. Voting by Military Personnel In previous elections, active military staff and conscripts voted from military barracks by mail, and the opposition could not monitor the process for fraud. A major change in the new Serbian election law provides for such voting to take place at the polling station nearest to the barracks. Thus, the voting is administered by multiparty civilian agencies. Election Oversight and Monitoring Supervisory Board While the supervisory board in the elections in September 2000 was composed of supporters of the Milosevic government, the ten-member board appointed by Serbian parliament on October 24 includes members with diverse political affinities. The Serbian media reported the opinion of the board on the course of the electoral process on one occasion, December 8, when the board criticized RTS for its pro-DOS bias. Independent Election Monitoring While the Milosevic government emphatically refused to allow the OSCE and nongovernmental organizations to monitor the September 24 elections, the monitoring of the December 23 elections will be unhindered. On November 28 the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights established a standard Election Observation Mission for the elections. The mission consists of ten election experts based in Belgrade and twenty-four observers deployed throughout Serbia. OSCE also announced the deployment of 150 short-term observers shortly before polling day. On November 27, the RIK authorized the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID) to monitor the elections. This includes attendance by CESID members during the printing of ballots and monitoring the work of the polling boards on election day.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","Free Speech, Press Freedom"

In a letter to members of the United Nations Security Council, Human Rights Watch urged the adoption of an arms embargo against all combatants, not only the Taliban. A backgrounder accompanying the letter, """"Fueling Afghanistan's War,"""" documents abuses by all sides to the conflict and sets forth new details on the role played by Afghanistan's neighbors and other nations in providing the weapons.  Human Rights Watch also urged the United Nations to take steps to ensure delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance. It called on the Security Council to remove the existing ban on the Taliban-controlled Ariana airline, on the ground that it interferes with the delivery of medicines and other needed aid to civilians. """"Ongoing abuses against civilians must take center-stage in any international intervention,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The United Nations should not ignore key humanitarian and human rights issues when it deals with Afghanistan."""" A draft resolution by the U.S. and Russia currently before the Security Council focuses on the Taliban's harboring of Osama bin Laden and would impose new sanctions only on the Taliban until it gives up bin Laden for extradition and closes camps allegedly used to plan criminal activities overseas. But the draft resolution does not directly address the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan, which has been accompanied by a severe humanitarian crisis. The Security Council's current draft resolution includes provisions to minimize the possible humanitarian impact of any new sanctions, but it does not go far enough.  """"It is particularly urgent that the Security Council address abuses by the warring parties now because they are an important cause of the continuing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,"""" Roth said in the letter to the Security Council. """"Failure to do so would mean inexcusably abandoning the Afghan people to suffer atrocities at home while focusing exclusively on the Afghan government's role in attacks on foreigners."""" The humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan has been fueled by atrocities against civilians committed by all parties to the conflict. State and non-state actors across the region and beyond continue to provide new arms and other materiel, as well as training and advisory assistance. These arms and materiel have been directly implicated in serious violations of international humanitarian law. The violations include aerial bombardments of civilian targets; indiscriminate bombings; rocketing and other artillery attacks on civilian-populated areas; reprisal killings of civilians and summary executions of prisoners. Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on all warring factions until significant progress is made to end violations of human rights and humanitarian law and to bring the perpetrators to justice. It emphasized that the ban must be strictly monitored and enforced and should include all forms of military assistance, including arms, other military materiel, and military training. Human Rights Watch takes no position on sanctions imposed on anti-terrorism grounds, but believes that human rights conditions in Afghanistan warrant Security Council intervention.

In a backgrounder released in advance of the December 23 elections for the Serbian parliament, Human Rights Watch concludes that Serbia's new electoral law significantly limits the possibility for fraud, and that the conditions are in place for the Serbian electorate to make a fairly objective judgment about the candidates. In light of Belgrade's relatively rapid progress toward democracy, Human Rights Watch said the international community should end the post-Milosevic """"grace period"""" in dealing with Serbia, and insist on stricter adherence to international human rights standards. """"There are still some serious human rights problems in Serbia, but the election conditions show a significant improvement since the last time around,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Now Yugoslavia can and should be held to the same standards as any other country on human rights.""""  Denber said the winner of the elections should be required to make urgent human rights improvements, such as releasing 600 Kosovo Albanian political prisoners and fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  Opinion polls indicate that the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) will win about 70 percent of the votes, and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) of Slobodan Milosevic up to 20 percent. A victory by DOS would finalize the transition of government in Yugoslavia and Serbia, which began with the victory of Vojislav Kostunica and DOS in the September 24 federal elections and the popular revolt on October 5, 2000, which removed Milosevic from power.  Although DOS politicians have a dominant presence in Serbian electronic and print media, other parties and movements receive fair coverage. The language used by pro-DOS media to describe other parties is neutral and objective—in stark contrast to the vitriolic anti-DOS language used by the media when they were under firm SPS control.  The new electoral law and the instructions issued by the Republic Election Commission have corrected some important shortcomings in the election laws which regulated previous elections.

The new law, however, fails to ensure representation of ethnic minorities in parliament. A high 5 percent threshold for a party to get a seat in parliament resulted in a decision by the main political party representing Serbian Muslims (3 and 4 percent of the population) not to participate in the elections.  The electoral regulations also leave unresolved how non-Albanians from Kosovo will have access to the vote. With the mass displacement of Kosovo Serbs after the end of the 1999 NATO war, their vote—traditionally the major source of fraud in the elections in Serbia—became even more confusing and opaque.

Lavrov Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations 136 East 67th Street New York, N.Y. 10021 Your Excellency,   We are writing in regard to the resolution currently before the Security Council that would impose further sanctions on the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Because Afghanistan rarely appears on the Council's agenda, it is particularly unfortunate that the present discussion is limited to the Taliban's role in harboring Osama bin Laden and supporting foreign criminal activity, and does not directly address the grave abuses that continue to be perpetrated against the country's own civilian population. It is particularly urgent that the Security Council address these abuses now because they are an important cause of the continuing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Failure to do so would mean inexcusably abandoning the Afghan people to suffer atrocities at home while focusing exclusively on the Afghan government's role in attacks on foreigners. We call on the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on all warring factions until significant progress is made to end violations of human rights and humanitarian law and to bring the perpetrators to justice, not just the one-sided embargo unconnected to the human rights of the Afghan people which is currently contemplated. We also urge the Security Council to take additional measures to protect delivery of humanitarian aid, including lifting the existing ban on international flights by Ariana, the Taliban-controlled carrier, because the ban has interfered with the delivery of medicines to civilians. The Security Council should restrict arms sales to all warring factions; all have committed severe abuses and none is making a serious effort to bring perpetrators to justice. The ban should be strictly monitored and enforced and should include all forms of military assistance, including arms, other military materiel, and military training. Although Taliban forces are currently on the offensive and have been responsible for some of the worst recent incidents, the parties that constitute the National Islamic United Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (the """"United Front"""") have also committed grave abuses in the conflict. The cumulative result has been massive internal displacement and large refugee flows into neighboring countries.  According to estimates by international relief agencies, there are presently at least 140,000 internally displaced persons in Afghanistan as a result of armed conflict during 1999 and 2000. In addition, some 30,000 refugees arrived in Pakistan between early September and November 9, when the border was officially closed to all but those who had already registered with UNHCR. An additional 17,000 refugees have since made their way to Pakistan despite the border closure. Other avenues of flight have been closed off or severely limited, with Tajikistan sealing its border in mid-September, following the Taliban's capture of Taluqan city, and Iran turning away thousands of new refugees and detaining others. This displacement is directly linked to the conduct of the warring parties, and the devastating effect that such conduct has had when combined with the severe drought that has hit the region. During the past two years, Taliban offensives have been accompanied by scorched-earth tactics in the Shomali plains north of Kabul, summary executions of prisoners in the north-central province of Samangan, aerial bombardment of opposition-held areas in the central Hazarajat region, and forced relocation and conscription in newly-occupied areas. The burning of crops and destruction of irrigation systems in 1999 have prevented many rural families from returning to their places of origin. Other families have been unable to continue farming or grazing, after having sold off livestock in order to make payments to avoid conscription. As is well known, the Taliban has also continued to discriminate harshly against women. Taliban officials have continued to beat women on the streets of Kabul for dress code violations and for venturing outside the home without the company of a close male relative. In Kabul, girls are for the most part not permitted to attend school, although primary schools for girls are permitted in other parts of the country. Women's employment remains severely restricted and is generally limited to the health care sector.  During the same period, military setbacks have left United Front forces defending home territories in northeastern and central Afghanistan. There have nevertheless been reports of abuses in districts, such as Bamiyan and Sangcharak in 1999, that were temporarily held by United Front factions. The principal targets in these attacks, which include summary executions, burning of houses, and looting, have been ethnic Pashtuns and others suspected of supporting the Taliban. The various parties comprising the United Front also amassed a deplorable record of attacks on civilians between the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 and the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996. In fighting with the Taliban and in internecine battles among themselves for control of Kabul, Jamiat-i Islami, Junbish, Hizb-i Wahdat, and other United Front factions repeatedly engaged in aerial bombardment and shelling of residential areas, and in some areas committed rapes and summary executions of civilians.  The abuses just described are facilitated by the involvement of Afghanistan's neighbors and other states in providing weapons, ammunition, fuel, and other logistical support to their clients. In his report last month to the General Assembly on the situation in Afghanistan, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan observed that """"the flow of arms and other war-making materiel into Afghanistan continued unabated"""" during the past year, as indicated by the intensity of this year's fighting, and """"even rose to new levels"""" during the last few months. State and non-state actors across the region and beyond continue to provide new arms and other materiel, as well as training and advisory assistance. Other countries have indirectly provided support to the combatants.  The principal supplier to the Taliban is Pakistan. The parties that comprise the United Front obtain arms from Iran and the Russian Federation. The arms provided have been directly implicated in serious violations of international humanitarian law. The appendix attached to this letter provides background to the conflict, additional information on humanitarian law violations by all parties, and a summary of external military support to the combatants. Ending this arms flow is an essential step toward curtailing the suffering of the Afghan people. We also urge the Security Council to ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of the arms embargo. The seriousness with which the December 8 draft currently before the Council addresses these issues marks an important advance, which we commend. The proposal offered here, however, will require additional measures to ensure that the ban is enforced equally against all parties and does not inadvertently end up assisting one side. One precondition to success is deployment of a sufficient number of international monitors on the ground. We note that an arms embargo study produced by the U.N. Secretariat, entitled """"A Review of the Options on Embargo of Military Supplies to the Warring Factions in Afghanistan,"""" found that unless observers were stationed on the ground in Afghanistan, monitoring, detection, and assembly of evidence would be """"virtually impossible."""" The ban on new weapons flows should also include benchmarks against which compliance can be measured. Finally, any embargo, including the existing one, needs to minimize humanitarian harm. Although some Security Council members have characterized the proposed sanctions as """"smart sanctions"""" because of provisions specifically designed to ensure continued delivery of aid to civilians, we believe those provisions do not go far enough. In particular, we urge that the Security Council withdraw the existing ban on all international flights by aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the Taliban, a ban it imposed as part of sanctions in October 1999.  Prior to the imposition of the flight ban, the state airline Ariana operated cargo and passenger flights to and from Dubai and Sharjah. According to a report that was issued this month by the Office of the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan, the ban has prevented a major health care institution in Kabul, the Indira Gandhi Pediatric Hospital, from restocking essential drugs with its main supplier; together with India's curtailment of donated medicines, this has led to an exhaustion of the hospital's stocks and forced children's families to purchase medicines in the market at prohibitive cost. The ban was also found to have disrupted postal services and contributed to loss of income and employment in harvesting, packing, and distribution of fruit intended for the export market, while the loss of income for the airline was found to have contributed to the declining safety of its fleet and diminished training for its flight operators.  We are aware of the possibility that Ariana flights could be used to circumvent an arms embargo. This concern, however, can be addressed by having arms embargo monitors inspect Ariana flights for arms shipments. The Council should use means that are the least restrictive on the civilian population in achieving its goals, and, in this case, inspection of flights is preferable to an absolute ban. Thank you for your attention to these important matters.  Yours Sincerely,    Kenneth Roth Executive Director     Joanna Weschler U.N.

We call on the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on all warring factions until significant progress is made to end violations of human rights and humanitarian law and to bring the perpetrators to justice, not just the one-sided embargo unconnected to the human rights of the Afghan people which is currently contemplated. We also urge the Security Council to take additional measures to protect delivery of humanitarian aid, including lifting the existing ban on international flights by Ariana, the Taliban-controlled carrier, because the ban has interfered with the delivery of medicines to civilians. The Security Council should restrict arms sales to all warring factions; all have committed severe abuses and none is making a serious effort to bring perpetrators to justice. The ban should be strictly monitored and enforced and should include all forms of military assistance, including arms, other military materiel, and military training. Although Taliban forces are currently on the offensive and have been responsible for some of the worst recent incidents, the parties that constitute the National Islamic United Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (the """"United Front"""") have also committed grave abuses in the conflict. The cumulative result has been massive internal displacement and large refugee flows into neighboring countries.  According to estimates by international relief agencies, there are presently at least 140,000 internally displaced persons in Afghanistan as a result of armed conflict during 1999 and 2000. In addition, some 30,000 refugees arrived in Pakistan between early September and November 9, when the border was officially closed to all but those who had already registered with UNHCR. An additional 17,000 refugees have since made their way to Pakistan despite the border closure. Other avenues of flight have been closed off or severely limited, with Tajikistan sealing its border in mid-September, following the Taliban's capture of Taluqan city, and Iran turning away thousands of new refugees and detaining others. This displacement is directly linked to the conduct of the warring parties, and the devastating effect that such conduct has had when combined with the severe drought that has hit the region. During the past two years, Taliban offensives have been accompanied by scorched-earth tactics in the Shomali plains north of Kabul, summary executions of prisoners in the north-central province of Samangan, aerial bombardment of opposition-held areas in the central Hazarajat region, and forced relocation and conscription in newly-occupied areas. The burning of crops and destruction of irrigation systems in 1999 have prevented many rural families from returning to their places of origin. Other families have been unable to continue farming or grazing, after having sold off livestock in order to make payments to avoid conscription. As is well known, the Taliban has also continued to discriminate harshly against women. Taliban officials have continued to beat women on the streets of Kabul for dress code violations and for venturing outside the home without the company of a close male relative. In Kabul, girls are for the most part not permitted to attend school, although primary schools for girls are permitted in other parts of the country. Women's employment remains severely restricted and is generally limited to the health care sector.  During the same period, military setbacks have left United Front forces defending home territories in northeastern and central Afghanistan. There have nevertheless been reports of abuses in districts, such as Bamiyan and Sangcharak in 1999, that were temporarily held by United Front factions. The principal targets in these attacks, which include summary executions, burning of houses, and looting, have been ethnic Pashtuns and others suspected of supporting the Taliban. The various parties comprising the United Front also amassed a deplorable record of attacks on civilians between the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 and the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996. In fighting with the Taliban and in internecine battles among themselves for control of Kabul, Jamiat-i Islami, Junbish, Hizb-i Wahdat, and other United Front factions repeatedly engaged in aerial bombardment and shelling of residential areas, and in some areas committed rapes and summary executions of civilians.  The abuses just described are facilitated by the involvement of Afghanistan's neighbors and other states in providing weapons, ammunition, fuel, and other logistical support to their clients. In his report last month to the General Assembly on the situation in Afghanistan, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan observed that """"the flow of arms and other war-making materiel into Afghanistan continued unabated"""" during the past year, as indicated by the intensity of this year's fighting, and """"even rose to new levels"""" during the last few months. State and non-state actors across the region and beyond continue to provide new arms and other materiel, as well as training and advisory assistance. Other countries have indirectly provided support to the combatants.  The principal supplier to the Taliban is Pakistan. The parties that comprise the United Front obtain arms from Iran and the Russian Federation. The arms provided have been directly implicated in serious violations of international humanitarian law. The appendix attached to this letter provides background to the conflict, additional information on humanitarian law violations by all parties, and a summary of external military support to the combatants. Ending this arms flow is an essential step toward curtailing the suffering of the Afghan people. We also urge the Security Council to ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of the arms embargo. The seriousness with which the December 8 draft currently before the Council addresses these issues marks an important advance, which we commend. The proposal offered here, however, will require additional measures to ensure that the ban is enforced equally against all parties and does not inadvertently end up assisting one side. One precondition to success is deployment of a sufficient number of international monitors on the ground. We note that an arms embargo study produced by the U.N. Secretariat, entitled """"A Review of the Options on Embargo of Military Supplies to the Warring Factions in Afghanistan,"""" found that unless observers were stationed on the ground in Afghanistan, monitoring, detection, and assembly of evidence would be """"virtually impossible."""" The ban on new weapons flows should also include benchmarks against which compliance can be measured. Finally, any embargo, including the existing one, needs to minimize humanitarian harm. Although some Security Council members have characterized the proposed sanctions as """"smart sanctions"""" because of provisions specifically designed to ensure continued delivery of aid to civilians, we believe those provisions do not go far enough. In particular, we urge that the Security Council withdraw the existing ban on all international flights by aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the Taliban, a ban it imposed as part of sanctions in October 1999.  Prior to the imposition of the flight ban, the state airline Ariana operated cargo and passenger flights to and from Dubai and Sharjah. According to a report that was issued this month by the Office of the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan, the ban has prevented a major health care institution in Kabul, the Indira Gandhi Pediatric Hospital, from restocking essential drugs with its main supplier; together with India's curtailment of donated medicines, this has led to an exhaustion of the hospital's stocks and forced children's families to purchase medicines in the market at prohibitive cost. The ban was also found to have disrupted postal services and contributed to loss of income and employment in harvesting, packing, and distribution of fruit intended for the export market, while the loss of income for the airline was found to have contributed to the declining safety of its fleet and diminished training for its flight operators.  We are aware of the possibility that Ariana flights could be used to circumvent an arms embargo. This concern, however, can be addressed by having arms embargo monitors inspect Ariana flights for arms shipments. The Council should use means that are the least restrictive on the civilian population in achieving its goals, and, in this case, inspection of flights is preferable to an absolute ban","Europe/Central Asia, Greece","Economic Justice and Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/14/update-human-rights-violations-niger-delta","Update on Human Rights Violations in the Niger Delta","Update on Human Rights Violations in the Niger Delta","","12/14/2000","Lack of Accountability for the Destruction of OdiAbuses in OgonilandOlugbobiri: Nine killed by soldiers at an Agip flow stationRecommendations   The restoration of civilian rule in Nigeria has not produced a reduction of human rights violations in the oil producing regions of the Niger Delta, even though the location and types of abuse have changed to some extent. Since the inauguration of President Olusegun Obasanjo in May 1999, the government has continued to show a disturbing willingness to deploy indiscriminate lethal force in response to criminal activity, ethnic conflict, or protests related to oil production. In November 1999, soldiers killed hundreds of people in an assault on the community of Odi, where twelve policemen had been killed by an armed gang. Soldiers, naval personnel, and paramilitary Mobile Police deployed across the delta carry out summary executions, assaults and other abuses on an ongoing basis. In Ogoniland, a small part of the Niger Delta, although the blanket repression of the military government of Gen. Sani Abacha is past, the security forces continue to target those who oppose the resumption of oil production, suspended since 1993. At this writing, no one has been held accountable for these abuses.   The end of military rule has allowed greater debate over the issues feeding the ongoing crisis in the Niger Delta, in the National Assembly and elsewhere, but there is a growing frustration among those who live in the oil producing communities at the failure of the executive and legislature to respond to their demands for compensation for the damage done to their land and livelihoods by oil production and for a greater share of the oil wealth. Although the 1999 constitution provides that 13 percent of the revenue derived from onshore oil production should be paid to the states where it is produced, there have been substantial delays in calculating and paying these sums. Groups from across the political spectrum in the so-called south-south zone have also demanded rather that the oil producing states assume """"full control"""" over their natural resources, and pay tax from those revenues to the federal government. President Obasanjo has rejected the idea of any negotiation surrounding the further reallocation of revenue under the constitution, emphasizing instead the creation of a Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which will disburse funds for development projects. Many of those living in the oil producing communities reject the NDDC as an answer to their demands, charging that it is likely to be as corruption-ridden as previous similar bodies, and does not address the central issue of resource control. Frustration at what is seen as a lack of movement in addressing the concerns of the oil producing communities has fed ongoing protests, ranging from demonstrations of small groups waving placards to attempts to close down production of oil at particular facilities in an attempt to draw attention to the demands of local communities. Oil company staff are regularly taken hostage by semi-organized groups of youths from the riverine areas of the delta, sometimes using armed force. Hostage-taking has in some cases had the aim of raising the profile of local demands, but often has served to extort high ransoms for the release of oil workers - though all the oil companies deny publicly that ransom money is paid. In the most high profile recent incident, 165 oil workers on a drilling rig contracted by Shell's Nigerian subsidiary were held captive between July 31 and August 5, 2000, by some one hundred young men in Ekeremor local government area, Bayelsa State. Violence between neighboring ethnic groups and communities, often triggered by disputes over the siting of oil facilities and distribution of benefits related to the oil industry, continues to flare on a regular basis, leading to dozens of deaths over the past year.   The rupturing of fuel pipelines owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), usually by commercial operators who siphon off fuel for sale on the black market, has increased. Both NNPC and the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) have dismissed workers accused of facilitating the vandalization of pipelines for the purposes of stealing fuel. The result of these operations is not only to exacerbate Nigeria's chronic fuel shortages, but also, tragically, the death of hundreds of people engulfed in explosions as they try to scoop fuel from the leaking pipes after the commercial operators have left. In the most serious such fire, in October 1998, more than one thousand people died in Jesse, Delta State, but similar explosions have continued to take place. Several hundred people died in July 2000 in a fire in Adeje, near Warri, Delta State, and dozens died from smaller explosions throughout the year. Shell has also reported increasing theft, or """"bunkering"""" of crude oil from its facilities, resulting in the loss of up to 32,000 barrels per day of production recently. In response to this situation, the government has repeatedly announced new security initiatives for the Niger Delta, including the creation of a task force on the vandalization of pipelines, partly funded by NNPC. However, the security forces have often failed to protect property from damage or civilians from violence, and have themselves carried out serious and widespread violations of human rights in response to such incidents. The pipeline vandalization task force has reportedly carried out several extrajudicial executions of persons suspected of vandalizing pipelines or stealing petroleum products. In November, the government reportedly threatened to reintroduce the death penalty for those convicted of pipeline vandalization.  Lack of Accountability for the Destruction of Odi   On November 4, 1999, an armed gang killed seven Nigerian policemen in the community of Odi, Bayelsa State. Five other police were killed in subsequent days. President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote to the governor of Bayelsa, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, threatening to declare a state of emergency if those responsible for the murders were not apprehended within two weeks - though responsibility for policing is, in fact, a federal duty in Nigeria. Before the deadline could expire, soldiers from the Nigerian army moved into Odi, a community of 15,000 people or more, engaged in a brief exchange of fire with the young men alleged to be responsible for the deaths of the policemen, and proceeded to raze the town. The troops demolished every single building, barring the bank, the Anglican church and the health clinic, and left graffiti that included ethnic slurs and reflected views that the town and the whole Ijaw ethnic group must be punished for the crimes committed by their sons.   One year later, information collected by community leaders from former residents of Odi indicates that perhaps as many as 2,000 people were killed by the army in this operation - described by a presidential spokesman as """"a carefully planned and cautiously executed exercise to rid the society of these criminals."""" People were killed in their homes by mortar shells; in summary killings, especially of young men captured by the soldiers as they advanced into the town; or following torture and rape. Though young men were especially targeted, many, perhaps most, of those who died were old people or young children. Dozens of young men are believed to have been summarily executed by soldiers over the subsequent days and weeks after being picked up at road blocks and identified as Ijaw by characteristic tribal markings.   There has been no government-supported independent investigation of these events, and no military personnel are known to have been prosecuted for the atrocities committed in Odi. Indeed, although President Obasanjo has expressed """"regret"""" for what happened, the officers who commanded the operation have reportedly been promoted. More than forty men are held in detention and have been charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with the original killings of the twelve policemen, and their trials are still pending. Only minimal relief has been distributed by government agencies to Odi residents, and such reconstruction of the devastated town as has occurred has been at the expense and on the initiative of those residents that have returned to rebuild their homes. In an attempt to obtain some redress, the victims are bringing civil suits against the Nigerian government for compensation.  Abuses in Ogoniland   The Ogoni, an ethnic group perhaps half a million strong, led the upsurge in protests at oil production over the last decade and demands for greater benefit from oil to be returned to the areas where it is produced. Ogoniland, their homeland, is close to the city of Port Harcourt in Rivers State. The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), created in 1990 and led by Ken Saro-Wiwa, organized mass demonstrations which resulted in the closure of oil production in Ogoniland in 1993. In response, the military government of General Sani Abacha cracked down on MOSOP's activities, detaining dozens of activists for extended periods, deploying a specially created military task force to Ogoniland, and setting up a special tribunal which convicted Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders after a trial that blatantly violated international standards of due process. The """"Ogoni Nine"""" were executed in November 1995. Following the death of General Sani Abacha in June 1998, the interim government of General Abdusalami Abubakar disbanded the military task force that had been deployed to Ogoniland and released the remaining Ogoni political detainees. For the first time in years, Ogonis were free to meet and express their political views.   Although the situation in Ogoniland improved with the end of military rule, there are continuing human rights concerns. In March and April 2000, for example, repressive force was once again used in Ogoniland, when paramilitary Mobile Police deployed to the village of K-Dere, Gokana local government area. Several Ogoni civilians were killed and a number of others detained for various periods and charged with different offenses. According to reports from MOSOP and other groups monitoring the situation, the background to this violence centered on various development projects, in particular the construction of roads, to be funded by Shell, whose Ogoniland production remains suspended. The new local authorities in Ogoniland, installed at the time of the restoration of civilian government in May 1999, tend to favor renewed oil production, since they can hope to benefit from the contracts likely to be awarded.   Independent visitors to Ogoniland who have interviewed local people uniformly report their view that the majority of Ogonis oppose a return of Shell to the area. Any activity that can be interpreted as indicating a desire to resume operations, even if not directly related to oil production, therefore has the potential to create significant tension within the community.   On March 21, 2000, Ledum Mitee, a MOSOP leader and co-defendant of Ken Saro-Wiwa, wrote to the chairman of the Royal Dutch/Shell group of companies, warning that the activities of its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC), risked reigniting conflict in Ogoniland. SPDC officials have repeatedly stated in meetings with Human Rights Watch and elsewhere that the company is only interested in making safe its facilities in Ogoniland, and in carrying out development projects aimed to restore community trust. However, MOSOP charged that Shell's """"local staff and contractors are now using similar tactics to those of the last decade in what appears to be a desperate attempt to establish a foothold in Ogoni which will allow the company to restore oil operations in the area."""" The organization condemned a failure to consult with local communities before operations to work on SPDC pipelines or projects, including road building, proceeded. MOSOP later reported that two vehicles of the Mobile Police, a paramilitary unit of the Nigerian Police Force, were present on March 21 in Gokana local government area, Ogoniland, where the road project was to proceed, and were shooting in the air in an attempt to terrorize the local population. There were some clashes with local youths, and the police were reinforced in the days following, leading to an escalation of violence. On March 23, six people were arrested by Mobile Police following a demonstration at the site of the road, and tensions continued to escalate, taking the form of a dispute between two neighboring communities, K-Dere and B-Dere. Ledum Mitee informed the SPDC General Manager in Port Harcourt of these developments, and Shell's contractor working on the road project was withdrawn on March 23. The company later repeated previous statements that it is """"committed to not working in areas where we are not welcome,"""" and in correspondence with Mitee denied a lack of consultation over its projects. MOSOP reported that the community was quiet by the end of March.   On April 11, Mobile Police working with a group of civilian youths, about whose criminal activities MOSOP had previously complained to the police, entered the K-Dere community early in the morning, apparently with the intention of arresting those opposing the road project and intimidating others into dropping their opposition. At least ten houses in K-Dere, including Mitee's own, were burnt down. On April 13, Ledum Mitee was arrested, when he returned from a trip to Abuja, joining at least eight other people already in detention. Mitee was held for five days and then charged with two others with arson (of houses that are in fact undamaged) and attempted murder, and released on bail. These charges are still outstanding. All who had been detained were released on bail within three weeks.   According to MOSOP and other local human rights activists, at least four and possibly up to ten people were shot dead by police in the violence that took place over several days. On April 29, MOSOP reported that armed thugs had again attacked a venue where MOSOP was holding a meeting, though fortunately without causing casualties. Again, in August, there were reports that thugs had severely beaten one person and taken away two others, in advance of a planned demonstration in Tai local government area against a rumored return of Shell to the area. Similar tensions also came to the surface on November 10, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, when scuffles took place between youths attempting to force businesses to close in commemoration of the date, and others apparently linked to the local government authorities.   At this writing, there has been no official inquiry, as called for by MOSOP, Human Rights Watch, and many other groups, into the abuses suffered by the Ogoni people under the military regime of General Abacha, nor have there been prosecutions of members of the security forces alleged to be responsible for those abuses. The only forum that may lead to some partial accountability is the Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission, headed by Justice Chukwudifu Oputa (commonly referred to as the Oputa Commission), which is investigating """"mysterious deaths"""" and assassinations and other human rights abuses during the period January 1966 to June 1998. More than 10,000 cases from Ogoniland were submitted to the Oputa Commission, which will hold public hearings in Port Harcourt in January 2001, at which some of these cases will be considered. However, given the limited resources of the commission, it is clear that the repression in Ogoniland can receive only the most superficial examination.   President Obasanjo visited the delta, including Ogoniland in September 2000, in which he held a minute's silence in honor of the executed MOSOP leaders, but urged the Ogoni people to """"put the past behind us so that we can move forward.""""  Olugbobiri: Nine killed by soldiers at an Agip flow station   On October 14, 2000, a group of fifty-one youths approached the Tebidaba flow station, operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company Ltd (NAOC) near Olugbobiri, Bayelsa State, in three speedboats. According to information gathered by local human rights organizations, and interviews with eyewitnesses carried out by Human Rights Watch three weeks later, their intention was to enter the flow station and close down production, in order to protest the failure of NAOC to complete certain agreed projects in the Olugbobiri community to the satisfaction of the community. The youths were unarmed. Soldiers and naval personnel posted at the flow station opened fire on the boats without warning, using both a machine gun and what were described by the youths present as """"bombs,"""" presumably grenades. The youths dived into the water in order to escape, but eight were killed at the site, and another died later in hospital.   Several of the bodies have not yet been recovered. Sixteen were seriously injured, of which four were still in hospital at the beginning of the second week in November. Following the incident on October 14, the military stationed at the flow station were reinforced, according to community members. These forces have been responsible for razing to the ground a small fishing settlement close to the flow station, a satellite of the main Olugbobiri community, and for ongoing harassment of those attempting to get to their fishing grounds.   After the killing of the nine youths, the central zone of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), the most high profile youth organization in the riverine areas of the delta, held a meeting on October 22, at Okolobiri, Bayelsa State, where an ultimatum was given to Agip to vacate Ijaw territory. The following day, Felix Tuodolo, president of the IYC, was invited to the Rivers State police headquarters in Port Harcourt and detained for six hours. He was questioned by the Rivers State commissioner of police, who alleged that he had incited youths to kidnap and kill NAOC expatriate staff and blow up NAOC facilities, a charge Tuodolo denied. Visiting Olugbobiri six weeks after the incident, Bayelsa State governor Alamieyeseigha stated that he would set up a commission of inquiry into the incident.   There have been negotiations between NAOC and Olugbobiri for some years over development projects. In particular, recent discussions had centered on the construction of a road through the community, and there was discontent at what was described as a unilateral decision by Agip to reduce the width of the road from six meters to four meters and at flooding caused by the initial works. These discussions had resulted in correspondence between Agip and the community, and a meeting on October 3 at the Bayelsa State government house, at which Agip allegedly stated that it had been forced to sign a memorandum of understanding with the community under duress and hence was not obliged to complete the projects.   Several weeks prior to the October 14 incident, seven members of the community went to the flow station by boat in order to report a spillage at a flow line between wells eight and ten, and to request assistance from NAOC in providing diesel for the generator, since an important visitor was coming to the village. In a preview of what happened later, soldiers and naval personnel opened fire, though they aimed around the boat, rather than at it. They called the boat to come to the flow station, firing around it as they came. When the seven people, including the chair and secretary of the youth association and the interim chair of the community, got to the facility, they were stripped and beaten. Although the soldiers later apologized, saying that they had been informed that the delegation was intending to switch off the flow station, they were simply sent back to the community with no further redress.   The incident at Olugbobiri is one in a series of cases reported at NAOC facilities in which members of the armed forces have shot at and killed or injured civilians, or accidents at the site of Agip operations that have resulted in civilian casualties. In May 2000, for example, a devastating fire killed at least six people involved in cleaning up a spill from a NAOC pipeline near Etiama, Bayelsa State, allegedly as a result of a faulty pumping machine that ignited the spilled crude oil.   Human Rights Watch has received reports of additional cases of extrajudicial executions:  the shooting dead of five youths by naval personnel posted at NAOC's Brass terminal in June 2000, following protests at the non-fulfilment of a 1994 memorandum of understanding with the community;  the shooting death of three other youths near a spill from a pipeline carrying crude to the Brass terminal in November 1999;  and the shooting dead of eight youths from Ikebiri, Bayelsa State, on April 19, 1999, as they were on their way to attend a meeting with the state commissioner of police in Yenagoa, by armed escorts accompanying a NAOC maintenance crew.   Human Rights Watch asked Agip for comments on all these incidents, but had not received a response at this writing.  Recommendations   Human Rights Watch calls on the Nigerian government to:  Undertake an immediate process of criminal investigation of the events described above in Olugbobiri and Ogoniland, with a view to instituting criminal proceedings against those allegedly responsible for the operations in each case, including both perpetrators and their commanding officers, where appropriate. Appoint independent and public judicial commissions of inquiry into the events in Ogoniland under the military regime and in Odi in November and December 1999, with a wide mandate to examine the causes and consequences of the security force operations and to make recommendations for appropriate redress to those affected in each case, including the monetary compensation and the institution of criminal proceedings against those allegedly responsible for the operations in each case, including both perpetrators and their commanding officers, where appropriate.   We call on Agip to:  Undertake an immediate high level review of the provision of security at its facilities in Nigeria, including the incident at Olugbobiri; take steps to protest abuses with the appropriate authorities and urge that appropriate criminal and disciplinary action be taken against those responsible; and ensure that those allegedly involved in abuses are removed from guarding Agip facilities.","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

The two prisoners, Angel Moya Acosta and Julia Cecilia Delgado, each received one-year sentences after being arrested during a massive crackdown In the past two weeks, some 200 people have reportedly been arbitrarily detained across Cuba, most for short periods. All but four of these people have been released, the majority without charges being brought against them. Besides Moya and Delgado, two additional dissidents, Leonardo Bruzón and Orlando Fundora, remain in detention. """"By arresting some two hundred people, Cuba has chosen a perverse way to celebrate International Human Rights Day,"""" said Joanne Mariner, Deputy Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. International Human Rights Day is marked every year on December 10.  The 200 people who were detained are from various provinces. A large number were picked up by police on December 4 at public religious celebrations in honor of Santa Barbara. Others were detained on December 8 and 9. All of these detentions are thought to have been a preventative measure to discourage public gatherings for International Human Rights Day. A large number of people were also detained on December 10 in both private residences and in the streets where small gatherings commemorating International Human Rights Day were being held.  According to Elizardo Sánchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, the Cuban government has never in recent years detained such a large number of dissidents in such a short period of time.  The trial of Moya was originally scheduled for today. With no warning to Moya and his family and under a shadow of secrecy, the one-hour trial took place on Tuesday. Delgado's trial, which was also secretive and closed to observers, lasted three hours. The charges and convictions stem from complaints by Moya and Delgado when they were detained on December 4 at public religious observances and not allowed to call their families.  Hundreds of other peaceful opponents of the government remain behind bars in Cuba, convicted under laws restricting freedom of expression. Convictions of """"contempt for authority"""" carry a three-month to one-year sentence.","Americas, Cuba",""

Interviewed by Human Rights Watch as he was being escorted to safety, the twenty-two-year old eyewitness described in harrowing detail a more than three-hour ordeal in which the workers were abducted by a group of fifteen men, interrogated, beaten with rifle butts, driven around to two military command posts, tied up, and finally shot at point-blank range. One of their captors filmed the executions with a videocamera. Three bodies were subsequently discovered at the site. The fate of a fourth man, a villager abducted together with the aid workers, is not known. According to the witness, the man who ordered the killings was a well-known """"cuak,"""" or informer for the army, named Ampon Thayeb, who has worked with the Indonesian military in the Lhokseumawe area for more than a decade. He was accompanied in the operation by three other Acehnese, and at least ten other men in civilian clothes, all carrying sophisticated automatic rifles, who appeared to be soldiers and who got out of their vehicles briefly at the two army posts before proceeding to the execution site. One of the ten was referred to as """"dan,"""" short for commander, and Ampon sought instructions from him as to where the workers should be killed. """"This is one of the rare cases in Aceh in which a victim has come forward and publicly identified the perpetrator,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Residents of Lhokseumawe told us he has been terrorizing the area for more than a decade. The Indonesian government can have no excuse for failing to arrest and prosecute Ampon Thayeb and his army backers."""" As the eyewitness account makes clear, Ampon killed the humanitarian workers because they were treating torture victims in an area known as a stronghold of the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM) and assumed they were all GAM supporters. Three of those killed worked for Rehabilitation Action for Torture Victims in Aceh (RATA), a non-governmental organization (NGO) linked to the internationally known International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, based in Denmark. The surviving witness said Ampon ordered two of the workers, Idris and Ernita, out of the vehicle in which they were all being held. The witness then watched, horrified, as the two were shot. He and two others were ordered out of the same van, but he had managed to untie his hands, and as soon as he had both feet on the ground, he ran for his life. He heard two shots as he was running, and assumes that the other two were killed in the same manner as the first. He escaped with just a cut lip and bruises from being beaten. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called for an investigation into the killings and for international monitoring of any investigation by Jakarta-based embassies or by a donor delegation to Aceh. Human Rights Watch today called on Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid to invite U.N. specialists on torture, arbitrary execution, and human rights defenders to conduct an independent assessment of rights abuses in the conflict-torn province. It also said that Exxon-Mobil and other foreign companies operating government-owned facilities in Aceh should publicly and privately call for an independent investigation of the murders, and assure the local Acehnese population that the companies will not cooperate with any units of the Indonesian security forces shown to have been involved in these killings or previous extrajudicial executions in Aceh.","Asia, Indonesia",""

We are concerned by the Department of Justice report, released in September, showing evidence of racial and geographic disparities in the federal government's administration of capital punishment. According to that report, of the nineteen persons on federal death row as of July 20, fifteen were members of minority groups. Minority defendants accounted for 74 percent of the cases in which federal prosecutors sought the death penalty. In addition, fewer than 10 percent of U.S. federal districts accounted for some 43 percent of prosecutorial recommendations of the death penalty.  Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty and because executions are inevitably carried out in an arbitrary manner, inflicted primarily on the most vulnerable-the poor, minorities, and mentally ill or retarded persons. Moreover, the intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons may be executed.  Particularly at a moment when there are serious questions about how the federal death penalty is applied, we believe it would be unconscionable for the federal government to carry out executions. Although we support total abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium ordered by you at this time would ensure that no executions take place until the basic procedural fairness of the federal death penalty system can be guaranteed.  Sincerely,  Kenneth Roth Executive Director","United States",""

Marking the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Human Rights Watch charted the erosion of refugee protection throughout Western Europe, where punitive policies toward asylum-seekers have obstructed the right of individuals to seek and enjoy asylum. """"European countries, as well as North America and Australia, have systematically diluted their responsibilities towards refugees over the past ten to fifteen years,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"These countries were the primary architects of the international refugee regime in the aftermath of the Second World War - but they are also primarily responsible for its demise.""""  Among the Western European policies that have obstructed the rights of refugees are:  instituting visa requirements for nationals from refugee-producing countries; placing heavy fines on airlines that transport asylum seekers who do not have valid travel documents; posting European immigration officials in refugees' countries of origin shifting responsibility for refugee protection onto neighbors in Central Europe, where refugees are less protected against forced return to their home countries; and refusing asylum to people who have fled persecution by non-state actors - such as in Algeria - or who have fled situations of generalized civil conflict, such as in Colombia. In an especially worrying development, European governments, such as Austria and more recently the United Kingdom, have proposed a major overhaul of the 1951 Refugee Convention, which they describe as outdated and ill-equipped to deal with modern day migration movements. In June 2000, UK Home Secretary Jack Straw proposed that individuals from countries that E.U. governments considered to be """"safe"""" should be excluded from refugee protection.  """"The asylum debate in Europe is taking place within an increasingly hostile and xenophobic environment,"""" said Reilly. """"European governments appear to be more concerned with protecting themselves than with protecting refugees.""""  Reilly said European countries were setting a very negative example to countries elsewhere, particularly in the developing world, who continue to host the vast majority of the world's refugees.  Human Rights Watch said that in traditionally generous refugee-hosting countries, including Pakistan, Thailand, Tanzania, and Guinea, governments are increasingly closing their doors to refugees and adopting restrictive and xenophobic refugee policies. Hundreds of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees were injured, dozens of women raped - many of them gang raped - and thousands were arbitrarily detained in Guinea in September 2000, following inflammatory anti-refugee statements by President Lansana Conte.  The document acknowledges the increasingly precarious security situation within which many countries, such as Tanzania, Guinea, and Thailand, are hosting refugees, and the need for the international community to provide additional support to these countries to strengthen their security.  Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR to face the following challenges as it marks its fiftieth anniversary:  to develop a more consistent and effective response to the plight of internally displaced persons, who now outnumber refugees, while at the same time preserving the right of all individuals to leave their country and seek asylum elsewhere; to develop more effective protection strategies for women, children, urban refugees, and stateless persons, all of whom have special protection needs, and to implement UNHCR's own guidelines more consistently; to ensure greater protection for humanitarian workers who dedicate their lives to protecting refugees. Human Rights Watch paid tribute to those UNHCR staff who lost their lives in West Timor and Guinea earlier this year. The new U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, replaces Sadako Ogata at the beginning of 2001. As a national of a European Union member state, Lubbers should remind E.U. governments of their obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, and act to reverse the negative trends in refugee protection in Western Europe.  Finally, the document draws attention to the serious funding crisis facing UNHCR and the gross disparity in the international response to the world's refugee crises.  """"The international community, especially Western countries, demonstrated their ability to respond with speed and generosity during the Kosovo refugee crisis,"""" said Reilly. """"Western governments should show an equal commitment to assisting refugees elsewhere in the world, particularly the forgotten refugee crises in Africa, where the needs of millions of refugees are sorely neglected.""""","Europe/Central Asia","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

Most recently, on 28 November, 2000, a gang of men armed with knives, hammers, and sticks stormed the offices of the Centre for Democratic Empowerment (CEDE), a nongovernmental organization in Monrovia. Human Rights Watch believes that this recent incident is part of a pattern of attacks against members of the Liberian human rights community and the independent media, intended to silence independent voices in Liberia.   The assailants physically assaulted CEDE staff, including director Conmany Wesseh and chair and former Liberian interim president Amos Sawyer. Nine CEDE staff required hospital treatment following the attack, including Conmany Wesseh who suffered stab wounds. The attackers also ransacked the offices, destroying computer and other office equipment. The recent attack on the CEDE office followed a meeting hosted by CEDE of Liberian nongovernmental organizations on curbing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the region. The police have reportedly arrested a number of those responsible for the November 2000 attack, and regret has been expressed by your government about the incident. However, it remains to be seen whether your government will take action to bring those responsible to justice. This is the second time that Conmany Wesseh has been made the target of a violent attack in the space of a year and a half. In July 1999, Mr. Wesseh's house was ransacked and his family threatened by over one hundred former combatants after he gave an interview saying that the welfare of ex-combatants was the responsibility of the government and not the international community. Several days earlier, on July 26, 1999, he had been threatened by the police chief who reportedly said, """"We won't touch you, but you will see."""" Mr. Wesseh had previously been assaulted by a dozen unidentified persons the night after the in-custody death of government critic Samuel Dokie. Despite initial arrests, those suspected of carrying out the attack were later released without charge, and no one has been held accountable for the July 1999 attack on Mr. Wesseh.  Independent voices in the human rights community and the media are steadily being silenced by the government in a bid to stem publicity and criticism of security force abuses and other human rights violations by the government. Journalists and human rights activists are regularly being subjected to mistreatment and violence at the hands of security forces, as well as to politically-motivated criminal charges in the courts and other restrictions. Additionally, attacks high-ranking government officials against human rights groups creates a permissive environment for attacks on human rights activists. Human rights activists have had to flee the country for fear of their lives. For example, in 1998, leading human rights activist Kofi Woods of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission fled the country after receiving threats and being followed by unidentified persons believed to be security officers who were frequenting his home and inquiring about his whereabouts. Mr. Woods had been speaking out against violations by the government.  In December, 1999, James D. Torh, the executive director of Fore-Runners of Children's Universal Development (Focus) fled the country after politically motivated criminal charges of sedition were brought against him after he made a speech to students. He reportedly said, among other things, that """"[President Charles] Taylor is running this government from his pocket and that those who voted for this government must repent that it is failing"""" and """"we are prepared to tell whoever that is in power that it is time of the Liberian people to stand up and tell you to step down.""""  In March 2000, independent Star Radio station was forcibly closed by government security, according to the police director for """"hosting of political talk shows, news, interviews and programs that have damaging political effects that tend to undermine the peace, security and stability of Liberia."""" Some fifteen police raided the offices, assaulted two journalists, confiscated the radio handsets, and ransacked and sealed the offices without giving a reason. Star Radio remains closed to date.  We are concerned that your government is not fully committed to ensuring respect for human rights and rule of law in Liberia. In order to ensure that your stated commitment to ensuring the rule of law in Liberia is a reality, your government must take immediate action to ensure the safety of human rights defender. Liberian government officials must end their public denunciations of the human rights community and independent media, and make a genuine commitment to ensure that Liberia becomes, in your word, """"a country based on laws, not men."""" Human Rights Watch calls on your government to bring the perpetrators of the attacks against the CEDE employees to justice and ensure the safety of civilians.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/11/chilean-appellate-court-ruling-pinochet-criticized","Chilean Appellate Court Ruling on Pinochet Criticized","Chilean Appellate Court Ruling on Pinochet Criticized","","12/11/2000","(New York) - Human Rights Watch today expressed dismay over the Santiago appellate court ruling in favor of General Augusto Pinochet, which dismissed criminal charges filed against Pinochet on December 1. In a unanimous (3-0) decision, the Fifth Chamber of the Santiago Appeals Court granted a habeas corpus writ challenging Pinochet's indictment for ordering kidnappings and extrajudicial executions following the 1973 military coup. The prosecution team has appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide the case in the coming weeks. While this decision is regrettable, it is by no means the end of the road for the Pinochet case,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The ruling was made on technical grounds, not on the merits. The Chilean Supreme Court has already determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Pinochet is guilty of the atrocities alleged."""" The key issue on appeal was whether Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia had followed correct procedures before issuing the indictment, which include a requirement that the defendant be allowed to make a preliminary statement before being charged. Judge Guzmán argued that Pinochet's 1999 reply to a questionnaire the judge sent while Pinochet was in detention in London (in which Pinochet protested his innocence and refused to answer the questions) was tantamount to a preliminary declaration. The Appeals Court rejected this argument.  If the Supreme Court confirms the appellate ruling, Judge Guzmán will be able to reinstate the charges once he has questioned Pinochet. Pinochet's defense counsel, however, are insisting that medical tests be carried out before such questioning takes place, in the hope that tests will find that Pinochet is physically unfit to stand trial.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern that politicians opposed to the Pinochet prosecution have mounted a campaign in recent weeks to question the integrity of judges and government officials who have played a key role in human rights investigations. The judges under scrutiny include Supreme Court Justice Luis Correa Bulo, who had been selected to evaluate whether Pinochet should be extradited to Argentina in the 1974 murder case in Buenos Aires of former army commander-in-chief Carlos Prats.  The Supreme Court, which is investigating influence-trafficking allegations against Justice Correa, recently removed him from all judicial duties, although these same allegations had been previously rejected by the Chilean Congress following an unsuccessful impeachment motion.  Attorney Clara Szczaranski, President of the Council for the Defense of the State, which is a party in the Pinochet case, has been publicly questioned for allegedly mixing her private practice with official duties. Judge Guzmán received a written reprimand from the Supreme Court for writing a letter of support to Szczaranski.  Another extremely worrisome signal is the fact that, under pressure from the armed forces, President Lagos has called a meeting of the National Security Council (on which the armed forces have half the votes) as soon as the Supreme Court verdict is known. """"The planned meeting indicates to the courts that Pinochet's indictment is considered an issue of national security, putting enormous pressure on them,"""" said Vivanco. """"Taken together, these events show how vulnerable the Chilean judiciary continues to be to political interference, even after many formal obstacles to Pinochet's prosecution have been removed.""""","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

Judge Rubén Dario Frutos reportedly issued the order for Stroessner's arrest on the basis of evidence that implicated the former dictator and his minister of the interior, Sabino Augusto Montanaro, in the forced """"disappearance""""of Paraguayan doctor Agustín Goiburú in 1977. Goiburú, a political dissident who had escaped from detention in Paraguay in 1970, was living in exile in Argentina at the time of his """"disappearance.""""

""""Like the Pinochet prosecution, it is proof of the growing international consensus that those responsible for gross human rights abuses should not escape punishment."""" He called on the Brazilian government to cooperate with Paraguay and allow the extradition process to go forward.  Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup in February 1989 and subsequently obtained political asylum in Brazil. But Vivanco rejected the notion that Stroessner had any legitimate claim to asylum protection. """"It is an abuse of the institution of political asylum to use it to protect human rights violators from justice,"""" said Vivanco. """"The whole point of asylum is to protect victims from further harm, not to grant impunity to perpetrators of abuse.""""  Vivanco noted that granting refuge to a public official credibly alleged to have committed grave violations of human rights contravenes basic principles of asylum law, which expressly refuse the right of asylum to human rights violators. Indeed, under the Convention against Torture, to which Brazil is a party, rather than extend its protection to such persons, the country is required to prosecute or extradite torturers found on its territory.","Americas, Paraguay","International Justice"

In a letter to Governor Gilmore, Human Rights Watch said that Red Onion inmates have been immobilized on their backs in a painful spread-eagle position with their arms, legs, and chest secured by straps as punishment for masturbating in front of female staff or for other minor, nonviolent misbehavior. They have been kept restrained for up to one to two days with infrequent breaks. Many of the restrained inmates have had to urinate on themselves. """"Staff at Red Onion are putting inmates through a degrading and painful ordeal,"""" said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel at Human Rights Watch. """"This is yet another flagrant abuse in a facility that has been plagued by misuse of force and human rights violations since it opened."""" The U.S. Constitution and international human rights law prohibit corporal punishment. According to widely accepted correctional standards, immobilization in five point restraints is an extreme measure that is warranted only in emergency circumstances, such as when an out-of-control inmate threatens immediate injury to himself or others and other means of restraint are ineffective. If an inmate must be strapped down, it should be for as short a time as possible and with frequent, periodic breaks. In its letter to Governor Gilmore, the New York-based human rights organization reported staff at Red Onion has been ignoring these basic standards. Many of the inmates restrained at Red Onion were accused of exposing their genitals to female staff or masturbating in front of them. Red Onion records show one such inmate was restrained for 50 hours with only two documented breaks to eat and use the toilet. In a letter to Human Rights Watch, he stated, """"When I was strapped down on that bed and after so long I couldn't hold my bladder and urinated on myself. I laid in my own piss, it came all down my chest, was in my head, and I couldn't clean my self up til they let me up…."""" After such a long period with his arms secured stretched out over his head, when he was released """"it felt like if someone were to touch my arm it would snap in two."""" Another inmate asserted that being kept in five point restraints for twenty-four hours caused """"the shoulder joints and muscles…to burn and ache extremely - many times spasmodically - with the pain reaching unbearable levels in ... a few hours."""" Inmate letters indicate the use of five point restraints as punishment has not been limited to instances of masturbation or """"flashing"""" one's genitals at female staff. One inmate, for example, stated that he was strapped down for twenty-four hours because he refused to talk to the warden at his cell front. The warden claimed this conduct was """"disruptive behavior."""" In its 1999 report, Red Onion State Prison: Super-maximum Security Confinement in Virginia, Human Rights Watch documented excessive and malicious use of force by prison staff and reported inmate claims that staff placed them in five point restraints as retaliation or punishment for misbehavior. In May this year, Human Rights Watch began receiving a new surge of inmate complaints about the use of five point restraints. The organization wrote to Warden Page True in June to inquire about the facility's policy and practice regarding five point restraints. The warden forwarded the letter to Director of the Department of Corrections, Ronald Angelone for response. Human Rights Watch subsequently wrote to Mr. Angelone directly and placed calls to his office. He has never responded.

Turkey's plans to introduce a new generation of high-security prisons have drawn increasing criticism abroad and controversy at home. More than two hundred prisoners are on a hunger strike in protest over the new facilities and some prisoners have reached the forty-ninth day of a """"death fast."""" The new """"F-Type"""" prisons will house up to three prisoners per cell, moving away from the current use of wards holding up to sixty or more people. Human Rights Watch does not oppose the cell system, but the group cautions that unless accompanied by a program of out-of-cell activities, the new prisons may amount to an isolation regime that violates international standards. Prisoners also fear that segregation in the smaller units will subject them to greater risk of torture and abuse.  Twenty-eight prisoners have been killed by Turkish prison staff and security forces in the past five years. Human Rights Watch has urged the Turkish government to address prisoners' concerns by announcing plans for running the facilities in accordance with international standards, guaranteed by independent outside monitoring by representatives of local bar associations, medical associations, and human rights organizations.  The CPT report released yesterday expressed """"no objection in principle to this move towards smaller living units, always provided that inmates have the opportunity to spend a reasonable part of each day outside their living units, engaged in purposeful activities."""" The CPT did not address the prisoners' additional fears that they are more likely to be subjected to ill-treatment in the privacy of a cell. It did however urge the Turkish government to publish a 1996 CPT report that discusses the new prisons, """"in order to stimulate public debate on this important issue.""""  Human Rights Watch called the Turkish government response to the CPT report """"evasive and defensive,"""" and said it missed an important opportunity to resolve doubts and fears about the new prisons. Moreover, the authorities' response included the extraordinary claim that prisoners held in small group isolation at Kartal Special Type Prison-a prototype for the new F-type prisons-remain in their cells twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, because they refuse to participate in any activities. According to former Kartal prisoners and lawyers of current prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the facility are never offered an opportunity to engage in activities out of their cells. """"To resort to falsehoods in the middle of the current crisis, when there is a need for trust above all, is inexcusable,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch.  There are some signs that the Justice Ministry may have changed its plans for the new facilities, but it continues to send ambiguous signals. Ministry officials have recently begun to admit that solitary or small group isolation causes physical and psychological damage, but they continue to employ an extreme form of isolation at the Kartal facility. The Ministry published a draft law to eliminate the legal basis for isolation in the new facilities, but the draft has not been enacted. The Ministry has also proposed a draft law to establish local prison visiting boards, but the plan is flawed because the selection procedures for the boards do not provide for sufficient independence.  On December 5, Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk made a public statement giving """"the most open undertaking"""" that prisoners would not be transferred to the new prisons until legal safeguards were in place, but this is in striking contrast to the Ministry's refusal, for nearly a decade, to give any information about how the new prisons were to be run. Unfortunately, the Justice Ministry commands little trust with prisoners or prisoners' families, who have long experience of medical neglect and recent memories of prison massacres. For examples, gendarmes beat and tortured ten prisoners to death in the Ulucanlar Prison in Ankara in 1999-only hours after officials had given assurance that no aggressive intervention would be taken against prisoners who had overtaken a wing of the prison.  Human Rights Watch has no position on the current hunger strike, which may be motivated by political demands and interests that are extraneous to the issue of the F-type prisons. On the other hand, the rights group opposes the Ministry's apparent initial plans to isolate prisoners in violation of their rights, Sugden said. He called on the Ministry to make its position clear.  """"If the Ministry has now changed direction, the public needs to understand that,"""" said Sugden. """"And if there is a chance that straightforward efforts at clarification can prevent a repeat of the 1996 hunger strike, in which twelve prisoners died, the Justice Ministry has a duty to walk an extra mile in order to achieve a resolution.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

The two leading global rights monitors called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the security officers responsible for the killings. """"The Indonesian government is allowing its security forces to target humanitarian workers in Aceh, just as it allowed militias to target such workers in West Timor,"""" the two human rights organizations said. """"The international community should be every bit as outraged over these executions as they were over the brutal killing of three United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) workers in September, and take equally firm action."""" Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International noted that the government of President Abdurrahman Wahid only began to take steps to curb militia violence in West Timor after the UNHCR killings prompted a strong UN Security Council resolution and veiled threats of economic sanctions. In Aceh, the systematic targeting of activists by security forces has been underway for months, but the international response thus far has been muted.  Four humanitarian workers traveling to pick up torture victims for rehabilitation treatment in the vicinity of Cot Mat Tahe village, North Aceh district on 6 December were stopped by plainclothes Indonesian security forces. They were transferred to other vehicles and tortured. One volunteer escaped but the other three were lined up on the road and shot in the head execution-style. According to the reports, a patient accompanying the volunteers was also killed in the incident. Initial reports indicate that the Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) and the military (TNI) were involved.  The volunteers were all local staff members of an organization called Rehabilitation Action for Torture victims in Aceh (RATA), a group sponsored by the Danish government through its embassy in Jakarta. There are now serious concerns for the safety of RATA's other staff and volunteers, especially the witness to the incident who is now in hiding.  The two organizations call on the Indonesian government to immediately initiate an investigation into the incident and to bring those responsible to justice. In view of the apparent involvement of the security forces in the killings any investigation must be carried out by experts who are independent of both the police and the military, if it is to be regarded as credible.  Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also demanded that the security forces, including Brimob, be under orders to comply with international human rights standards and that any of its members, including commanding officers, suspected of involvement in human rights violations be immediately suspended from duty. Brimob, although a police unit, is military in character and has been implicated in many recent violations in Aceh.  Acehnese human rights defenders, humanitarian workers and political activists have been the specific target of many of the violations in recent months. In a letter sent on 22 November 2000, experts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted a """"pattern of serious human rights violations"""" in Aceh including torture, extrajudicial executions of civilians, and death threats against human rights organizations personnel and called for investigation and prosecution of the crimes.  """"These latest murders underline the urgency of the U.N. experts' call for action by Jakarta to end attacks against the Acehnese population and for immediate measures to be taken to protect humanitarian and other human rights defenders,"""" the rights groups concluded.  Background Active armed groups in Aceh have mounted numerous attacks on police and military personnel, leading government forces to step up counter-insurgency operations. Hundreds of unlawful killings and arbitrary arrests of civilians have taken place in the process. Recent violations in which Brimob involvement has been reported include:  On 19 September 2000, two student activists with SIRA, a group that advocates a referendum on Aceh's political status, were beaten with rifle butts, cable, and belts and threatened with knives by members of Brimob after being seized at gunpoint in Banda Aceh. On 5 September 2000, Amrisaldin, a volunteer with a humanitarian organization, Save Emergency for Aceh (SEFA), was detained by members of Brimob in Meukek Sub-district. He was released the next day having been punched, kicked, slashed with a knife. He was also threatened with death and had his pubic, chest and armpit hair burnt with matches. On 27 August 2000, three staff of Oxfam working in South Aceh were hospitalised after being tortured by Brimob officers. All three were beaten.

The Human Rights Watch World Report 2001, issued in advance of Human Rights Day on December 10, describes human rights developments over the past year in 70 countries. It also analyzes the international community's response to serious human rights abuse.  Global trade and investment should provide for greater protection for human rights, the Human Rights Watch World Report says. The report also argues that the United Nations needs more resources to help end armed conflicts and aid refugee problems. The emerging system of international justice, including the international criminal court, should have more robust support from all countries, including the United States.  """"The world doesn't have global institutions with the muscle to adequately address the most urgent human rights issues of our time,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"We urgently need to remedy these institutional failings.""""  Among the crises addressed in the report: Russia has conducted its war in Chechnya with gross disregard for the suffering of the civilian population. Although the United Nations did censure Russia, Moscow has largely escaped international penalties for its conduct in Chechnya. Fresh atrocities continue in the nine-year civil war in Sierra Leone, despite the capture of a major rebel leader there. International efforts to establish a war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone are not proceeding quickly enough. The military in Colombia has still not severed its links with paramilitaries who are responsible for grave human rights abuses. U.S. President Clinton's waiver of the human rights conditions on """"Plan Colombia,"""" the massive U.S. aid package, is almost certain to exacerbate the abuses.  The government of Indonesia has not reined in militias in West Timor who were responsible for scorched-earth tactics in East Timor in 1999. Armed insurgencies in Ambon and Aceh are testing civilian control over the military.  Israel responded to Palestinian demonstrations protesting continued military occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza with force that was frequently excessive and indiscriminate, leading to many civilian casualties. The campaign for the International Criminal Court has picked up speed, with 115 countries having signed the treaty so far, and 23 having ratified it, despite concerted U.S. opposition. The court will become operational when 60 countries have ratified.  As the fiftieth anniversary of the office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees approaches on December 14, some of the least developed countries in the world are bearing the brunt of caring for refugees. Developed countries, which were responsible for establishing UNHCR in the first place, should bear a greater burden financially and keep their own doors open to refugees.  Human Rights Watch said the global economy had yielded undeniable wealth, opportunities, and jobs. But street protests over the past year in Seattle, Prague, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere reflect widespread popular concern over associated ills, such as an increase in the number of people living in poverty and the abuse of migrant workers. In the polarized debate over globalization, human rights offer an important and promising framework to address many problems, such as the tendency of some governments and corporations to compete by profiting from repression. Within the workplace, respect for freedom of association should allow workers to join together - in trade unions should they choose - to improve wages and working conditions. Similarly, the prohibition against discrimination should be used to help ensure that historically marginalized people enjoy the fruits of their labor on the same terms as others.  On a societal level, respect for civil and political rights, including the right to elect one's government, should enable the disadvantaged to have a voice in the direction of their country's social and economic development, including on such matters as increasing the minimum wage, protecting union activists from retaliation, enforcing prohibitions on discrimination, regulating extraction industries, or ensuring that investments are made with social values in mind.  This emphasis on rights would not guarantee particular wage levels, working conditions, or regulatory policies. Nor would it eliminate inequalities in bargaining power or eradicate all forms of social exclusion. But rights guarantees would allow a vigorous civil society to make its views heard, and permit people from around the world to have a say in the pace and direction of global developments. Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring agency based in New York. It accepts no funding from any government.","Global",""

The global monitoring group expressed concern that the Cambodian government could use an armed attack which took place in Phnom Penh on November 24 as a pretext to move against political opponents.  In the twelve days since the attack, more than 200 people have been arrested across Cambodia, most without a warrant as required by law. Many of those arrested or detained are affiliated with the royalist Funcinpec Party or the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP). """"The Cambodian government has a right to address threats to its security in accordance with the law, but the danger here is that the November 24 incident may become a pretext for the arrest and harassment of opposition figures,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division.  Beginning at 1:30 a.m. on November 24, an estimated forty to fifty men, some armed with automatic rifles, rocket launchers, and grenades, launched attacks in Phnom Penh near the Ministry of National Defense, the Council of Ministers building, and Division E-70 military base on the western edge of the capital. The government has attributed the attack to forces of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF), or Kongtoap Serey Cheat Kampuchea, an obscure group reportedly led by Cambodian-American Chhun Yasith.  Some observers, noting that within hours of the attack police were using computerized photo lists of alleged CFF members to round up suspects, have said the attack was orchestrated by the ruling Cambodian People's Party in order to crack down on its opponents.  Regardless of the motivations behind the attack, Human Rights Watch condemned the violence of the November 24 incident – in which eight people were reportedly killed and fourteen wounded – but called on Cambodian authorities to respect Cambodian law and international criminal justice standards in pursuing suspects.  Human Rights Watch has received reports of one suspect being tortured during interrogation and at least eleven others kicked or beaten during arrest. Those arrested include sixty-five detainees brought before the prosecutor in Phnom Penh and more than one hundred others – primarily civilians, students, laborers, and squatters – rounded up in police sweeps in other areas.  Although officials from the Royal Gendarmerie and Phnom Penh municipal court have allowed human rights workers and lawyers free and confidential access to many of the detained people since shortly after the arrests began, none of the detainees have been brought before a judge within forty-eight hours of their arrest as required by Article 13 of Cambodia's 1992 Penal Code.  As of December 5, the prosecutor at the municipal court had interrogated sixty-five people. The prosecutor has forwarded forty-six names to an investigating judge on preliminary charges of terrorism and organized crime but determined on November 29 and 30 that nineteen people should be released. However, it appeared that only one of the detainees authorized for release by the prosecutor a week earlier had actually been released from police custody.  Lists of people to be arrested have been drawn up in a number of provinces, with arrests of alleged CFF members carried out in Stung Treng, Battambang, Takeo, Kampot, Banteay Meanchey, Kompong Speu, Kandal, Kompong Cham, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Som, Siem Reap, and Pursat provinces.  Arrests to Date Include the following:  Sihanoukville: On November 26, Sihanoukville police and Gendarmerie set up checkpoints on the main roads into town and searched guesthouses, karaoke bars and other establishments, arresting eighty-one people. On November 27, another ten people were arrested. By November 30, all of the detainees had been released.  Pursat: On November 25, three Funcinpec-affiliated police officers were arrested, with at least one transferred to Phnom Penh on November 28. On November 27, twenty people were reportedly arrested and released the following day.  Phnom Penh: More than fifty people were arrested in the days after the attack and taken to the headquarters of the Royal Gendarmerie, and then to the municipal court for questioning. At 8 p.m. on November 28, sixty-five people – mostly squatters living in the vicinity of the railway station – were rounded up, loaded into trucks and held until 11 a.m. the next day in police station for interrogation.  Siem Reap: Authorities are reportedly looking for fifty people and investigating three NGOs for alleged involvement in CFF activities. On November 17, three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement with CFF, and transferred to Military Prison in Phnom Penh. All five were transferred to Phnom Penh municipal Court on December 4, where they were interviewed by the prosecutor.  Kompong Cham: Since November 24, at least eleven people have been arrested and sent to Phnom Penh.","Asia, Cambodia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/04/israel/palestinian-authority-letter-security-council","Israel-Palestinian Authority- Letter to Security Council","Israel/Palestinian Authority: Letter to Security Council","","12/04/2000","Human Rights Watch is writing to you, as the current president of the United Nations Security Council,  to urge that the Security Council move quickly to set up an international observer mission to monitor  and report on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in connection with the  continuing violence in Gaza and the West Bank.  The government of Mali tabled a draft resolution on November 30 that would establish a United Nations Monitoring Force (UNMOF) comprising approximately 2,000 unarmed military observers. This force, to be deployed throughout the West Bank and Gaza, would have a mobile capability to be able to respond to threats and potential threats to the Palestinian population. It would report on its activities and on specific cases to the Secretary-General, who would then issue public reports every thirty days. While we regard this draft resolution as providing a useful start for the Council's consideration, we hope that the Council will consider the following suggestions in the course of its discussions and debates.  First, we believe it is important that the observer mission needs to have human rights at the heart of its mandate. For this reason, the observer mission must include a high proportion of persons with expertise in monitoring violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. It should also include persons with expert knowledge of international law enforcement standards and their proper application in conditions of protracted civil disturbance.  Second, the reports of the mission concerning violations of human rights and international humanitarian law should be made available publicly and periodically. This is crucially important, in order that the monitoring function have the intended protective function, particularly when corrective steps by the relevant authorities are not forthcoming. Third, the mission's mandate should be to report on threats to the safety and security of all civilians. Palestinian civilians have suffered the overwhelming majority of fatalities and serious injuries in these clashes, and thus will likely be the primary beneficiaries of the greater protection that this observer mission should bring to the situation. It is nevertheless crucial that the mission indeed provide protection impartially by including all civilians within its scope.  These recommendations reflect our letter to the Council on November 14 urging the establishment of such an observer mission. Several members of the Council, in public comments or in response to our earlier letter, have stressed that deployment of an observer mission must have the consent of all relevant parties, including Israel. We fully understand the need for such agreement, but we believe that the members of the Council, particularly those countries closest to Israel, have a responsibility to endorse the establishment of such an observer mission and to use available diplomatic means to secure Israel's assent and cooperation.  The position to date of the Israeli government has been that it would only consent to such a force once a peace agreement has been reached. While international monitoring arrangements under the aegis of the Security Council may indeed be appropriate once an agreement has been reached, the proposal here is for a mission that can contribute to safeguarding civilians from serious and persistent violations of fundamental rights and humanitarian law while violent clashes continue.  The need for such a monitoring and reporting mission is immediate and acute. In that connection, Human Rights Watch welcomes the trip report released on November 27 by Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, which called for an international monitoring presence. Her report further stressed the need for the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War to """"assume their responsibility"""" under Article 1 of the Convention """"to respect and to ensure respect """" of its provisions """"in all circumstances."""" We urge you, in this spirit, to act without delay to secure the assent of all relevant parties to the authorization of an international observer mission to monitor and report on human rights and international law violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to provide the necessary resources for its earliest possible deployment.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/12/01/pinochet-arrest-hailed","Pinochet Arrest Hailed","Pinochet Arrest Hailed","","12/01/2000","(New York) - Human Rights Watch hailed Friday's decision by a Chilean judge to arrest and try former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Judge Juan Guzman indicted Pinochet on a charge of kidnapping, asking that he be held under house arrest and ordering him to face trial in connection with the """"disappearances"""" of prisoners in the first months his 17-year dictatorship.  """"This arrest is a great victory for Pinochet's thousands of victims,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"It does credit to Chilean democracy and to its legal system. Judge Guzman has conducted a very thorough and careful investigation.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that today's action would not have been possible had British courts not held that Pinochet was not immune from justice.  The cases in Chile against the former dictator gained momentum after U.K. authorities held him for seventeen months under house arrest in Britain while four states sought his extradition. Although Pinochet was returned to Chile in March 2000 on medical grounds, he found himself in a very different country than the one he had left. After years in which justice was a rarity, during 1999 the Chilean courts opened a spate of prosecutions of former generals and lower officers for human rights violations. In July 2000, in another important decision, they sentenced a former secret police agent to life imprisonment for murder. In August, Chile's Supreme Court rejected Pinochet's appeal against a lower court ruling stripping him of his parliamentary immunity.  Argentina has requested the extradition of Pinochet for his suspected role in the 1974 car-bomb murder of Chile's former army chief, Carlos Prats, who opposed Pinochet's coup.  Judge Guzman has ordered medical and neurological tests to determine Pinochet's fitness to stand trial.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/11/30/new-evidence-atrocities-sierra-leone-and-guinea","New Evidence of Atrocities in Sierra Leone and Guinea","New Evidence of Atrocities in Sierra Leone and Guinea","Civilian Suffering Continues Unabated as UN Secretary-General Makes a Visit","11/30/2000","(New York) - As the United Nations Secretary-General prepares to visit Sierra Leone, Human Rights Watch today released fresh evidence that civilian suffering continues unabated in the civil war there. In addition to providing details of ongoing atrocities by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Human Rights Watch also documented how armed factions fighting on behalf of the Sierra Leonean government have also attacked civilians in recent months.   Human Rights Watch called on UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to ensure that UNAMSIL, the UN forces in Sierra Leone, do more to protect civilians. In a letter to the Secretary-General, Human Rights Watch urged that the Special Court for trying war crimes in Sierra Leone should be created without further delay and be given """"Chapter VII powers"""" to enforce cooperation, and that it have jurisdiction over crimes committed from the beginning of the war in March 1991, instead of only since November 30, 1996.   Human Rights Watch also warned that the United Nations should enforce the international arms embargo against the RUF, which is now making incursions and committing abuses against civilians in neighboring Guinea.  Recent Abuses Documented by Human Rights Watch in Sierra Leone and Guinea  Abuses by Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone Abuses by RUF in Guinea Abuses by Civil Defense Forces Child Combatants Sierra Leone Army (SLA) Abuses   Since the resumption of hostilities in May 2000, Human Rights Watch has taken scores of testimonies from victims and witnesses of abuses taking place within Port Loko, Kambia, Makeni, Lunsar, Kono, Kenema and Kabala districts. While our research suggests that the RUF continue to commit the overwhelming majority of atrocities - including rape, murder, abduction, forced conscription, and amputation - we note with concern the rising number of serious abuses by the Civil Defense Forces (CDF, primarily the Kamajors and Gbithis) including rape, systematic extortion, looting of villages, commandeering of vehicles, recruitment of children, and torture and summary execution of suspected rebels. We have also documented RUF attacks on Guinean villages and civilians.   The following is a chronology of some of these violations and atrocities documented by Human Rights Watch in both Sierra Leone and Guinea since May 2000.  Abuses by Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone  August 9-10: RUF rebels conducted a recruitment operation in villages around the northern town of Kabala in which some forty civilians, mostly young men, were rounded up and """"tattooed"""" with the letters R-U-F by a rebel commander. The tattooing was done by cutting 1-2 inch letters into the upper chest with a razor blade or knife. Human Rights Watch interviewed twelve of those, including three adolescent girls, who managed to escape after being """"tattooed."""" Victims described the rape of at least eleven girls by the RUF during the operation.   July 28: A family from a small village in diamond-rich Kono district were """"tried"""" and brutally """"punished"""" for having defied the rebels' authority over mining and other issues. In the attack, one woman and two adolescents were executed, the hand of another woman was amputated, and yet another was gang-raped by the four RUF rebels perpetrating the attack.   July 12-15: Civilians fleeing Makeni in July described two waves of forced recruitment by the RUF. In the first stage, which began around July 12 and lasted for three days, hundreds of men and adolescent boys were seized in marketplaces, taken off trucks, or abducted from their homes. In the second wave starting July 21, the elders and chiefs from around Makeni were summoned for a meeting and told they had two weeks to provide thirty males from each of their chiefdoms. Forced conscription has also been reported around Kabala, Kono and Kambia Districts. Several witnesses said the RUF told the new recruits they were later to be sent to wage war against Guinea.   July 3-5: Elders from villages around the town of Magbele, in Port Loko District described seeing the bodies of seven men who had either been hung or had their necks broken through torture, during a series of rebel attacks. Several other witnesses described the abduction of six women and one young man during the same attack. Three of these women, including one who was eight months pregnant, were raped.   July 3: A 25-year-old women was one of nine women raped by rebels, including boy soldiers, during an attack on the town of Madigba, Port Loko District. She had been pregnant and lost the baby after being raped by five men.   Late June: A 33-year-old mother of six described how her husband was executed and decapitated by RUF rebels after he tried to stop them from abducting their 15-year-old daughter. Eleven other youths were abducted in the attack which took place as the civilians tried to flee the rebel-held town of Makeni.   Mid-June: A 45-year-old mother of eight saw her 21-year-old daughter and her newborn gunned down in front of her during an RUF attack on the town of Funkun, in the Northern Kambia District. They were, according to several witnesses, among seven civilians killed and over thirteen abducted in the same mid-June raid. Nine of those who were abducted were adolescents.   Mid-May: A 12-year-old girl from Mange-Burre in Northern Kambia District had her left hand amputated by RUF rebels after being captured along with some ten other village girls and adolescents while washing clothes in a stream.  Abuses by RUF in Guinea  September 15: A 15-year-old boy recuperating in a Freetown hospital described how he was wounded and five young men were killed by RUF combatants when they attacked the Guinean town of Kolakuri. The victim said the RUF fired directly into a house in which he and nine of his friends were hiding.   September 6: Several residents of the Guinean border town of Pamelap verified the involvement of RUF combatants, including high-level commanders, in an attack on the town. One man interviewed by Human Rights Watch witnessed an RUF combatant gun down two Guinean traders and one Guinean policeman. Other witnesses saw the bodies of at least fifteen other victims and verified the abduction of up to fifteen Guinean women who were later taken into Sierra Leone by the retreating RUF. One Sierra Leonean refugee living in the town witnessed the abduction by the RUF of two Italian Catholic priests who are still in their custody at this writing.  Abuses by Civil Defense Forces   October 10: A local journalist was abducted from his office and taken away in a car with tinted windows to a Kamajor base in Freetown. Inside this base, he was beaten by Kamajor officers who accused him of having written unfavorable articles about the Kamajors, and in particular about their leader, Deputy Minister of Defense, Chief Sam Hinga Norman. The journalist was held for two days before being freed.   August 16: An official convoy carrying Chief Norman and the Sierra Leonean Vice President, Joe Demby, was briefly delayed crossing a damaged bridge near the southern town of Mabang by a public bus which had gotten stuck by a broken plank. Human Rights Watch researchers spoke with five witnesses who described how Chief Norman personally ordered his security detail to open fire on the bus after becoming irritated at having to wait for it to be removed from the bridge. While the bus was empty at the time, the ricocheting bullets wounded two civilians. Chief Norman later refused to take the wounded to Freetown for treatment.   August 14: A 45-year-old truck driver was severely beaten and lost several teeth, and another was beaten and held """"prisoner"""" for several hours in a closed storage container by Kamajors controlling an extortion racket on a key bridge leading to the Southern and Eastern Provinces. The Kamajors manning the Mabang bridge routinely extort large sums of money from anyone wanting to take a vehicle across and subject drivers to excessive brutality if they are unable to pay their """"tax."""" Human Rights Watch researchers visiting the area spoke with several drivers who had waited up to three days to cross the bridge because they could not produce the amount required by the Kamajors.   Mid-July: Three women described being raped by Kamajor fighters in the Southern town of Moyamba after the mini-bus in which they were traveling was detained and all the occupants """"accused"""" of transporting goods to rebel held areas. One of the women interviewed was raped by one of the Kamajor commanding officers and others were raped within the CDF headquarters in Moyamba Town. Another was severely beaten on the head with a flashlight while resisting the sexual assault.   July 19: A 29-year-old RUF """"Discipline Officer"""" interviewed by Human Rights Watch inside a jail in Kenema, described being tortured by Kamajor militiamen after his capture. He said the Kamajors dropped burning pieces of plastic on his left arm, and cut him on the legs and shoulders with a knife. Human Rights Watch verified the injuries described.   July 17: A civilian from the northern town of Batkanu described seeing the head of a young RUF combatant on a stick at the entrance to the town. The RUF fighter had earlier that day been executed by Gbethi CDF militias who accused him of spying. The young RUF fighter had allegedly tried to surrender.   July 15: Villagers fleeing RUF repression and forced conscription in the town of Gbendembu described being later captured, tortured, and robbed by CDF Gbethi fighters who accused them of being rebel sympathizers. Many residents of Makeni who in June and July fled forced RUF recruitment and attacks by the government helicopter gunship, described similar incidents. In one such incident on July 18, a young man who sold cigarettes in Makeni market was executed.   July 15: An elder from Kangahun village, 12 miles from Moyamba, described how Kamajor fighters raided the village of Kangahun (Moyamba District.) In the attack the Kamajors beat up several residents, rounded up and stole all the livestock, and extorted money from the villagers.   July 12: A Sierra Leonean Army vehicle carrying an army paymaster with 9 million leones ($3,830 USD) in salaries was robbed by Kamajor fighters near Moyamba Junction. The money was shared among nine Kamajors and the local commander. The Kamajor authorities received considerable pressure to return the money to the army and some of it eventually was. é   Early June: A Kamajor fighter described how militiamen from his unit raped two village girls they had come across in the bush while patrolling near Rogberi Junction. He said the fighters accused the girls of being rebel sympathizers.  Child Combatants  Human Rights Watch and other credible witnesses and organizations have verified the continued use of child and adolescent combatants by Kamajor and Gbethi militias. Numerous children and adolescents, as young as 11, have been spotted manning checkpoints along the Freetown - Mile 91 highway, and around the towns of Moyamba, Yele and Bo.  Sierra Leone Army (SLA) Abuses A 24-year-old farmer from the Northern village of Alikalia described being tortured by an SLA lieutenant who accused her of being an RUF rebel. The woman had earlier this year been abducted and briefly held by the RUF. After being detained at a checkpoint outside of Kabala, she was severely beaten in the body and face, whipped and bound by wire at the elbows.","Africa, Guinea, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, International Justice, United Nations, Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape, Children and Armed Conflict"

We provide counseling and rehabilitation services to victims of torture  and abuse in Aceh… """"Then the cuak ordered us to take off our shoes, and told us to get out of the car. It was about 1 p.m. and we were still in Lapang village. They started threatening us, and began to beat us. When we fell down from the beating, the cuak would order us to get up again, and fire their rifles near our feet, not hitting us but getting close. I was hit hard on the side of my head, near the right temple, with a rifle butt."""" On December 6, at about 7:30 in the morning, I left my home village of Simpang Kramat, Kecamatan Kotamakmur, to go to the RATA office in Pusong [Lhokseumawe]. I arrived at the office at about 8:30 a.m., and then started out for the new RATA office in Kuta Blang where we were in the process of moving. I left in a RATA vehicle, together with three other RATA staff: twenty-seven year old Idriss, twenty-three year old Ernita binti Wahab, and twenty-four year old Bakhtiar.  From the new office, we left to provide treatment to some of our patients in Tanah Pasir. We reached Tanah Pasir at about 10:30 a.m., and brought three patients to the hospital [Puskesmas] in Lapang, had them treated, and brought them home. Then we left for Jambu Air around 12:30 p.m. to visit some other patients. We had only gone about 500 meters from where we had dropped off the first patients in Matang Baru, Lapang, when a TAFT [brand] car with a black top pulled up from behind us, cut in front of us and forced us to stop. Two other cars pulled up from behind us, one green KIJANG [Toyota minivan] and another darker car, and also stopped. The TAFT car had four people in it. One of them was a man well known as a government informant, a cuak. His name is Ampon Thayeb, and he goes by the name """"Teungku Pon"""" among his followers. Ampon is from Lhokseumawe, and is in his mid-forties. The three others in the TAFT car were all young Acehnese, in their early thirties, and are also known as cuaks [government informants]. One of them I know as Madya, he has a distinctive red moustache. The two vehicles who followed had about five men per car, and appeared to be TNI [Indonesian armed forces], but they were not wearing uniform. The driver of the green KIJANG was their commander, and the others called him """"Dan"""" [short for """"Komandan"""" or Commander]. These men were clearly not BRIMOB [mobile police brigade], because the BRIMOB troops being sent to Aceh these days are very young. These ones were in their thirties, they appeared big and strong. The men in all three vehicles were armed. Ampon carried a machine gun, I think it was an M-16, and had an FN pistol on his waist. Another one had a machine gun with a grenade launcher attached. The commander, Dan, had a pistol and an automatic rifle, most of the others also carried rifles. Ampon ordered us to get out of the car, as the three other cuaks pointed their guns at us. He asked to see our IDs, and took our wallets. The men in our group also were ordered to hand over our watches, and Ernita was ordered to take off her necklace and bracelets. We did what they told us.  The cuaks kept their guns pointed at us, and started questioning us as follows: Where are you coming from? We just came from treating patients. Where are your patients? We took them home. Who are you, that you can give people medical treatment? We are from an institute called RATA that treats victims of violence. What is RATA? The men seemed to get angrier and angrier. They accused us RATA workers of giving information about abuses to the observers of the humanitarian pause [Note: There is a small monitoring presence in Aceh as a result of a """"humanitarian pause"""" agreement between the Indonesian government and the GAM rebel movement.] We explained that we were not political, but humanitarian workers. Ampon said we were lying, because the area was known as a GAM [rebel] base, and no one would be brave enough to go there, implying that we had to be GAM [supporters]. We responded that we had an official letter [surat tugas] which allowed us to work freely in Aceh. The men wanted to see it, so I took it out of my wallet and gave it to them. [Passage of testimony withheld to protect confidentiality.] Ampon then asked, """"Who is paying you?"""" We replied that RATA got funds from the Danish government. One of Ampon's men said that was impossible that Denmark would provide us funds, that the [RATA] workers were getting 200 million a month from PT Arun [the local Mobil oil project]. Then they started accusing us of being GAM. Ampon said, """"Anyone who works for an NGO must be GAM."""" [""""Yang Kerja di LSM-LSM, GAM semua""""]. Then he accused us of stirring up the people [mengadu masyarakat]. After this, we were put in their cars. Bachtiar and I were put in Ampon's car, in the front. Ernita was taken to the dark car, and ordered to sit next to the driver. Idris was in the last car, the green KIJANG, with the commander. As the convoy proceeded, they continued asking us questions, as follows: So you work in the health field? Yes, we treat victims of DOM [military operations zone]. So how do you know who in this village is a victim of DOM? We know because we have contacts with local clinics [Puskesmas] and government health offices [Dinas Kesehatan] But you don't treat other kinds of victims, that's not fair. If we know of other victims of violence, we treat them all. Then the cuak ordered us to take off our shoes, and told us to get out of the car. It was about 1 p.m. and we were still in Lapang village. They started threatening us, and began to beat us. When we fell down from the beating, the cuak would order us to get up again, and fire their rifles near our feet, not hitting us but getting close. I was hit hard on the side of my head, near the right temple, with a rifle butt. Bachtiar and I were dripping blood. Those doing the beatings were not only the four cuaks, some of the others also gathered around and took turns beating us. One of the other armed men, the ones whom I think were TNI, was filming the entire beating and the abuse with a large shoulder-supported camera. Idris was beaten by the men in his car, and then brought to where I and Bachtiar were standing. As we were standing there, one of the [suspected] TNI took our RATA car and removed the RATA insignia and covered up the license plate. He then went up the road for about fifteen minutes and came back, in order to check if anyone was coming. [Passage of testimony withheld to protect confidentiality.] We first stopped at a KORAMIL [subdistrict military command] post for about fifteen minutes. I'm not sure which KORAMIL post it was. Soldiers from the KORAMIL surrounded the car and peered in, but none of us got out. [Note: According to a second source, the KORAMIL post is likely to be one of three in the area: Simpang Muling, Matang Kuli, or Blang Jreunere.] We then started driving down along Jalan Pipa [pipeline road], before stopping again at the TNI post at A13. Some of the [suspected] TNI got out from the cars--the cuaks stayed in the car--and the [suspected] TNI briefly spoke with the other soldiers at the post. Then the cars turned around and left. We went along Jalan Pipa, then along a small road by a rice paddy. Then we passed another military post. [At one point,] the man referred to as """"Dan"""" came over to Ampon's car. Ampon asked him where he should get rid of us, saying """"Should we finish them off here?"""" Dan told him, """"No, not here."""" At that point, one of the cuaks was going through our wallets, and found our ATM cards. He demanded to know our secret PIN numbers, and asked how many billions we had stashed away. Our convoy then approached the village of Cot Mat Tahe. It was now about 2:30 p.m. A bombing had taken place there earlier in the morning, and many people were still milling around out of curiosity. The [suspected] TNI members got out of the cars and aimed their guns at the people, ordering them into a kind of village hall. Others started running, and a man named Rusli was caught and beaten by the [suspected] TNI. They first shot around his feet, just as they had done with us earlier. Then Ampon took a big stone and slammed it down on Rusli's head, giving Rusli a two-inch gash. Others started kicking Rusli also. Finally, Rusli was brought into the car with Bachtiar and I. The convoy took off, first going north, then south, and then north again to the village of Keude Karing. Then we turned towards Lhokseumawe. We went into the village of Kandang, just on the outskirts of the city along the railroad line, then turned into the forest around Blang Raya. The convoy stopped in front of the Kandang high school, SMA Kandang. Everyone got out. At this point, Idris and Ernita were put in the same car with Bachtiar and I, and we were now the last car in the convoy. Ampon came to us and said, """"Now you are going to confess and say what's what if you want to live. We will give you fifteen minutes."""" One of us said, """"What can we confess, we are just volunteers?"""" """"Then it's clear you want to die,"""" Ampon replied. Thayeb got a rope and gave it to the cuak with the red moustache. The cuak tied the hands of all five of us: myself, Bachtiar, Ernita, Idris, and Rusli. [Passage of testimony withheld to protect confidentiality.] Ampon got into the car and another one from his gang got into the back. Ampon told the one in the back to put his gun in Ernita's mouth, which he did. One of them tried to say something to us but Ampon said, """"Don't talk to them, they're all pigs."""" Ernita was saying, """"Don't Pak [Sir], don't kill me."""" Two of the cars then drove off, Ampon's car and our RATA car. The other three stayed at the SMA school. The two cars drove about 400 meters in the forest along the railroad line. Near a ruined house, all of us started to get out, but Ampon said, """"No, two of them first."""" Idris and Ernita then got out of the car. They were brought to the house by the one with the red moustache and one of the [suspected] TNI who had their guns against the heads of Idris and Ernita. A [suspected] TNI man was filming the whole time. Ampon said, """"Don't shoot them standing up, make them lie down. It's enough to use one bullet per person. Ernita and Idris were then kicked to the ground, and immediately shot in the head. I was in the meantime trying to get my hands untied. I managed to do so, but kept the rope in place so it looked like I was still tied up. I then went to work on freeing Bachtiar's hands but only managed to get a few knots untied when the cuak came back and the three of us, myself, Bachtiar, and Rusli, were ordered out of the car. Rusli said to me, """"What will happen to my wife and children?"""" We were marched for about a meter, and when we got closer to the house I just ran. I later heard two shots as I took off, and believe that Bachtiar and Rusli were killed then. The men opened fire on me as I was running and emptied a full magazine trying to hit me. I ran for about fifteen minutes without stopping through tall grass. When the sun set, I was still in the forest. I went up a small hill and saw a house with a light in the distance. I went to the house and called out, but the family inside was scared. I was dressed only in my underwear. Eventually, they took me in and gave me food. I asked to be taken to the next village and they helped me, and finally I managed to make it home.","Asia, Indonesia",""

French President Jacques Chirac, who is visiting Washington today, is expected to urge Clinton to sign the treaty. The European Union, whose members all strongly support the court, is concerned that the United States not be left out of this major new international institution. One hundred and twenty governments, including virtually all of the U.S.'s closest allies, have already signed the International Criminal Court treaty, and 25 have already ratified. After the December 31st deadline for signing, states will only be able to participate in the court by ratifying the treaty. That would be very difficult for the United States because Senator Jesse Helms, among others, has said that he would not permit ratification to go forward.  """"By signing this treaty President Clinton will be taking an historic step for global justice,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"The President cannot stop human rights abuse after he leaves office, but he can help ensure that future victims have a place to turn for justice. That would be a legacy worth leaving.""""  The International Criminal Court will try future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court is the most significant international tribunal since the courts established to try Nazi leaders after World War II, and the most important advancement in human rights protection since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  President Clinton has supported more limited international criminal tribunals for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Iraq. In a speech to survivors of Rwandan genocide in 1998, President Clinton said, """"Talks are under way at the United Nations to establish a permanent international criminal court. Rwanda ... underscores the need for such a court. And the United States will work to see that it is created.""""  The pace of signature and ratification of the treaty has picked up speed in the last six months, and Human Rights Watch anticipates that sixty states will have ratified by mid-2002. Sixty ratifications will bring the treaty into force and trigger the establishment of the court.  """"The question is not whether this court will be established,"""" said Dicker. """"The court has tremendous support all around the world. The question is whether the United States will endorse it, and that decision rests with President Clinton alone.""""  The court is designed with numerous safeguards to protect the rights of the accused and guarantee the highest standards of due process. Under the court's """"complementarity"""" provisions, the U.S. government can ensure that no American ever be prosecuted before the court, by conducting good-faith investigations - and prosecutions, if necessary - of any U.S. citizens who might commit such terrible crimes.","United States",""

Constant is wanted by  Haitian prosecutors for serious human rights crimes in Haiti.  The Center for Constitutional Rights made this request to Attorney General Reno on August 4 and September 25, 2000, but has yet to receive a reply. Human Rights Watch has similarly written on several occasions to Secretary Albright without response  As you know, Constant was a founder and secretary general of the paramilitary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH). FRAPH members were responsible for human rights atrocities under the military government that ruled Haiti from 1991 to 1994, including extrajudicial executions, torture, and rape.  In February 1995 Constant's presence in the United States had become public and U.S. officials were pressured to arrest him. On March 29, 1995 Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote Attorney General Reno an extraordinary letter requesting Constant's """"expeditious deportation from the United States."""" Citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, Secretary Christopher """"concluded that the continued presence and activities of Emmanuel Mario Constant ... in the United States ... would . . . cast doubt upon the seriousness of our resolve to combat human rights violations . . . I also request that you take all steps possible to effect his deportation to Haiti."""" Secretary Christopher understood Constant's role in Haiti's terror:  [FRAPH] is officially regarded by the Department of State as an illegitimate paramilitary organization whose members were responsible for numerous human rights violations in Haiti in 1993 and 1994 . . . Mr Constant is one of the co-founders and current President of FRAPH. He was instrumental in sustaining the repression that prevailed in Haiti under the illegal military led regime ...  Constant was arrested and, after a court hearing, he was found deportable. In September 1995, Immigration Judge John Gossart found that Constant was the leader of FRAPH whose """"members were responsible for numerous human rights violations in Haiti and that he """"has been accused of notorious and abhorrent conduct."""" On December 13, 1995, the INS obtained a final deportation order against Constant. However, Constant was released from detention on June 14, 1996 and remains in the Untied States and in the New York City area.  U.S. officials have explained Constant's release from detention and the failure to deport him by claiming that Haiti's judicial system was inadequate to deal with his case. In an August 29, 1997 letter to Michael Ratner, Vice-President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, INS General Counsel David A. Martin stated that immediate deportation """"would place an undue burden on Haiti's judicial and penal system,"""" and that the INS would deport Constant once it was """"advised by the Department of State that Haiti's judicial and penal systems have developed the capacity to deal with a case of this magnitude."""" This despite assurances by high- ranking Haitian officials at the time that Constant would receive a fair trial.  We draw your attention to the fact that the Haitian government has recently concluded a major trial of defendants accused of the April 1994 Raboteau massacre in which as many as 15 Haitian slum-dwellers were killed and over 200 injured. After a trial of six weeks, 16 soldiers and their accomplices were found guilty for their role in the massacre. Six of the defendants were acquitted. In a separate branch of the same trial, Constant was convicted in absentia of """"assassinat"""" (premeditated homicide). When he is returned to Haiti he will be entitled to a new trial. Several admitted members of FRAPH were present and convicted of participating in the massacre.  The Raboteau trial illustrates that the Haitian justice system has the capacity to provide a fair trial to major defendants. The case was painstakingly built over several years by a group of determined Haitian lawyers. All of the defendants in custody were represented by defense counsel. Numerous eyewitnesses testified, and their testimony was buttressed by international experts in forensic anthropology, genetics, military organization, and human rights as well as documents from the Haitian military archives. (Unfortunately, the prosecution did not have access to the """"FRAPH/FAd'H Documents,"""" materials seized by U.S. forces from the Haitian military and FRAPH in September 1994 and still not returned to Haiti.) An important witness was Colin Granderson, the former head of MICIVIH, the UN/OAS human rights mission that investigated the massacre. According to the present U.N. mission (MICAH), """"these trials constitute a significant step in the fight against impunity in Haiti demanded by the entire Haitian people, and prove that the Haitian justice system is able to effectively try the authors of crimes and other infractions, and human rights violations in general, while respecting the guarantees of the 1987 constitution and the international treaties signed by Haiti."""" (Our translation.) The United Nations Independent Expert on Haiti, Adama Dieng, said that the Haitian justice system had taken """"a huge step forward"""" with the completion of the Raboteau trial.  Constant's presence in New York is a daily source of dismay and even menace to the city's large Haitian community. A number of these Haitians are terrified that Constant is freely walking the streets. In 1998, at a hearing held by the New York City Council prior to its adoption of a resolution calling for Constant's return to Haiti, numerous Haitians declined to exercise their First Amendment rights to testify out of fear for their lives and those of their families in the United States and Haiti.  While the U.S. government formally endorses programs designed to improve Haiti's justice system, it is simultaneously - through the failure to return Constant or the seized documents - obstructing efforts to establish justice for Haitian human rights victims. A central purpose of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the United States signed on April 18, 1988 (before Constant's alleged crimes were committed), and ratified on October 21, 1994, was to prevent alleged torturers from evading responsibility for their actions by imposing a duty on states to prosecute or extradite such suspects.  We therefore urge you to proceed with the expeditious deportation of Constant. It is also our view that he should be detained until such time that the depuration order is executed. We would like to arrange a meeting with you to further discuss this issue at your earliest convenience.","Americas, United States, Haiti","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Secretary-General Kofi Annan Regarding His Upcoming Visit to Sierra Leone","","11/29/2000","Dear Mr. Secretary-General,       Human Rights Watch welcomes your decision to visit Sierra Leone on December 2-3. We hope that your visit will bring much-needed attention to the pressing issues that continue to obstruct peace and security, notably the ongoing human rights abuses against civilians and the pervasive climate of impunity. Human Rights Watch has maintained an office in Freetown since April 1999 and has documented these abuses extensively. We hope that your visit to Sierra Leone will result in a strengthened resolve to fully implement existing Security Council resolutions on these critical issues. Of particular importance is the need to proceed swiftly to establish the Special Court for Sierra Leone.       Your last visit to Sierra Leone came the day after the signing of the July 7, l999 Lome Peace Accord, when hopes for an end to the brutal eight-year war were high. A year and a half later, war crimes and crimes against humanity continue to be committed against Sierra Leonean civilians and little progress has been made on respect for human rights and the establishment of the rule of law. Serious human rights abuses have been perpetrated primarily but not exclusively by rebel forces, and these abuses have intensified since the May collapse of the peace process. This has included a disturbing increase in violations by pro-government forces, primarily the civil defense militia, and Revolutionary United Front (RUF) atrocities against the civilians in neighboring Guinea. Human Rights Watch has documented abuses including mutilation, abduction, rape, summary executions and other acts of murder, and lawlessness by all sides (a list of recent abuses documented by Human Rights Watch is attached).   Given that the conflict in Sierra Leone has been characterized by systematic atrocities against civilians, we urge you use your visit to focus new attention on the need for UNAMSIL to protect civilians. Specifically, we urge you to publicly reaffirm UNAMSIL's obligation under its current mandate to protect civilians and to ensure that this be established as an immediate and primary concern of troops on the ground. UNAMSIL should be required to take all necessary measures to protect civilians within its areas of deployment, and to use its best efforts to expand the zone within which it is able to protect civilians.     We believe that UNAMSIL's efforts to promote protection for civilians would be greatly improved if the work of the human rights unit were better integrated into the larger UNAMSIL mission. In this regard, we urge you to ensure that the human rights unit be strengthened with the necessary mandate and resources to enable it to investigate and publicly report on human rights abuses by all sides to the conflict, and that its findings and recommendations be given due weight by UNAMSIL's military and political components.     The establishment of the Special Court for Sierra Leone remains an urgent priority, which should be highlighted during your visit. As your seventh report on UNAMSIL (October 31, 2000) indicated, the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission """"could contribute to ending impunity and developing respect for the rule of law, and bring closure to victims of human rights abuses."""" However, progress toward establishing the court has been extremely slow, and your direct engagement is needed to finalize a new statute and proceed toward establishing the court. In order for the court to be as effective as possible, it is essential that the court be given Chapter VII powers to enforce cooperation at every stage, including the production of witness testimony or other evidence, the service of warrants, and the search, arrest, and surrender of suspects to the Special Court. We also urge that the court's temporal jurisdiction be extended back to the start of the war in March 1991, rather than be limited to the currently envisioned November 30, 1996 cutoff date. A truncated scope of temporal jurisdiction may impose grave evidentiary hurdles to any prosecutor attempting to show the responsibility of those in command. For example, Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader, was himself at liberty for only three months between November 1996 and the signing of the Lome accord in July 1999. It would be enormously detrimental to the effort to end impunity in Sierra Leone if Sankoh were only tried for his abuses against U.N. peacekeepers, and not for his crimes against the Sierra Leonean people. We urge you to publicly reaffirm that there can be no impunity for perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity by any side to this conflict.     The regionalization of the conflict in Sierra Leone is a cause of great concern, highlighted by the ongoing arms flows into the country, reports of RUF troop movements toward the Guinean border, and the recent attacks against refugees in Guinea. A key issue that we urge you to address is the reports of repeated and blatant violations of the U.N. arms embargo against the RUF. UNAMSIL must be capable of responding to these reports, which would require the deployment of well-equipped U.N. forces to monitor borders (especially with Liberia), roads and airstrips bordering on rebel areas. We further call on you to use your visit to remind neighboring states of their international obligation not to return any refugees to a country where their lives may be threatened.     On November 10, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) brokered a 30-day cease-fire between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front. Although the RUF commits itself to the immediate return of all weapons, ammunition and other equipment seized by them, we are very concerned about the lack of commitment by the RUF to release all civilian abductees and for both warring sides to respect human rights. While the terms of the agreement explicitly define any attack against UNAMSIL personnel and equipment as a violation of the cease-fire, there is no such mention with regard to attacks against the civilian population. This cease-fire agreement thus misses a critical component of the conflict in Sierra Leone, and should not be used as a rationale for not moving forward with other pressing issues. Furthermore, any future attempts at the extension of the cease-fire must include the missing elements mentioned above.     For the UN mission in Sierra Leone to become a model for future UN operations, it must more effectively integrate at all levels a commitment to international human rights and humanitarian law. This includes strengthening UNAMSIL's human rights unit, but also involves more effective training in international humanitarian and human rights law for all international troops, an essential precondition to their deployment in such a difficult environment. Humanitarian law advisers should be deployed with the troops in order to ensure the highest possible protection for the civilian population. In some past U.N. operations around the world, U.N. peacekeepers have themselves been responsible for human rights violations, and after some highly embarrassing media reports, the Secretariat pledged to create institutional mechanisms to address such situations. To our knowledge, however, no meaningful measures have been implemented. The U.N. mission in Sierra Leone would set an important precedent by creating a mechanism for prompt investigations of alleged human rights violations committed by peacekeeping troops. Such investigations should be conducted by the civilian human rights unit, and their results should be acted upon as a matter of highest priority by the operation's leadership.     The continuation of widespread human rights abuses in Sierra Leone is an affront to international law, and undermines the prospects for peace and reconciliation that Sierra Leoneans so desperately seek. We hope that your visit will signal a new commitment to ending human rights abuses in that conflict. Our staff stands ready to assist you and members of your delegation with further information.     Wishing you a productive trip,     Sincerely,         Janet Fleischman   Washington Director for the Africa Division of   Human Rights Watch   Joanna Weschler   U.N.

In a letter to Manuel Marulanda, commander of the Revolutionary Armed  Forces of Colombia (FARC), Human Rights Watch drew special attention to Henry A. Grosch-Garces,  a Buenaventura man who is believed to be seriously ill. It is estimated that the FARC is holding hundreds of civilians hostage, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. All civilians taken by guerrillas and paramilitaries and held for ransom or political concessions are considered hostages by Human Rights Watch. """"Kidnapping civilians is a particularly brutal way of subjecting ordinary citizens to the violence of war,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch. """"That is simply unacceptable. International law forbids the targeting of civilians in wartime. We stand with these families and call on all sides in this conflict never to target civilians."""" According to Human Rights Watch's information, the FARC seized Grosch-Garces at his residence at La Bocana, on Buevaventura's harbor, on May 28, 1999. Subsequently, the family received several ransom calls from a man identifying himself as a representative of the FARC's 30th Front. The kidnappers also forwarded letters to the family reputedly from Mr. Grosch-Garces, pleading for money. In one of the last calls, the kidnappers told the family that Grosch-Garces was seriously ill. Another hostage who was briefly held with Mr. Grosch-Garces confirmed that the captors were members of the FARC. After his release, this hostage told the family that he had seen Mr. Grosch-Garces briefly in October 1999, and reported that he appeared near death. Grosch-Garces was a heavy smoker and suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure.  Human Rights Watch defines hostages in accordance with the globally-accepted standards established by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Hostages are """"persons who find themselves, willingly or unwillingly, in the power of the enemy and who answer with their freedom or their life for compliance with [the enemy's] orders."""" There is an international consensus that a hostage taking occurs when something is demanded in exchange for an individual's release, whether it be money or political concessions, clearly relevant in this case. Hostage-taking is prohibited by Article 1(b) of Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions as well as Article 4 (2) (c) of Protocol II. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly pointed out to FARC leaders that the applicability of the laws of war is not a matter of choice. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies automatically once a situation of armed conflict exists objectively. Protocol II is applicable when opposing forces in an internal conflict are under a responsible command, exercise enough control over territory to mount sustained and coordinated military operations, and are able to implement Protocol II, all of which the conflict in Colombia clearly satisfies.

Grosch-Garces, taken as a hostage by the 30th Front of the  FARC on May 28, 1999, near Buenaventura.  According to our information, the FARC seized Grosch at his residence at La Bocana, on Buevaventura's harbor. Mr. Grosch's wife, Beatriz Concha Eastman, and others were present, and later told Human Rights Watch that armed men immediately identified Mr. Grosch, forced him into a boat, and disappeared.  Subsequently, Concha Eastman received several telephone calls at her home and work from a man identifying himself as a representative of the FARC's 30th Front and demanding a ransom of 700 million pesos. The kidnappers also forwarded letters to the family reputedly from Mr. Grosch, pleading for money. In one of the last calls, the kidnappers told Concha Eastman that her husband was seriously ill.  Another hostage who was briefly held with Mr. Grosch confirmed that the captors were members of the FARC. After his release, this hostage told the family that he had seen Mr. Grosch briefly in October 1999, and reported that he appeared moribund. Grosch was a heavy smoker and suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure.  Later reports indicated that Mr. Grosch may have died, but no body has been recovered. If this proves true, we urge you in the strongest possible terms to release this information immediately and return Mr. Grosch's remains to the family.  In public statements, you and other FARC leaders have claimed that you do not take hostages, but rather """"retain"""" civilians in order to charge a tax. However, I would like to point out that there is an international consensus that a hostage-taking occurs when something is demanded in exchange for an individual's release, whether it be money or political concessions, clearly relevant in these cases. Human Rights Watch defines hostages in accordance with the globally-accepted standards established by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Hostages are """"persons who find themselves, willingly or unwillingly, in the power of the enemy and who answer with their freedom or their life for compliance with [the enemy's] orders."""" Hostage-taking is prohibited by Article 1(b) of Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions as well as Article 4 (2) (c) of Protocol II. According to the laws of war, hostage-takers seek to influence the behavior of third parties in some way by threatening a hostage with physical harm; the definition relies on the hostage's detention by a party to the conflict and the possibility that the hostage will be exchanged for some concession made by a third party. In all cases where an individual is taken hostage, combatants are required to treat captives humanely and, when a release is planned, guarantee their well-being during that release. In this case, evidence strongly suggests that the FARC failed to provide adequate medical care to Mr. Grosch, an additional violation of the group's responsibilities under the laws of war. As we have repeatedly pointed out to FARC leaders, the applicability of the laws of war is not a matter of choice. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies automatically once a situation of armed conflict exists objectively. Protocol II is applicable when opposing forces in an internal conflict are under a responsible command, exercise enough control over territory to mount sustained and coordinated military operations, and are able to implement Protocol II, all of which the conflict in Colombia clearly satisfies. Human Rights Watch considers that all civilians taken by the FARC and held for ransom or political concessions are hostages. Their continued captivity and mistreatment is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, and we call for their immediate, unconditional, and safe release.

Judge Sánchez investigated the 1986 murder of El Espectador director Guillermo Cano and issued an arrest warrant for Escobar, a notorious drug trafficker. After receiving serious threats from Escobar and his associates, Judge Sánchez was given a diplomatic post in the United States and assured of constant protection. President Pastrana has announced plans to appoint a replacement for Judge Sánchez as consul in Washington, D.C., which will strip her of the security she still needs. """"Judge Sánchez is still in danger, and she has a right to protection,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch. """"As the judge in the Escobar case, she was doing nothing more than fulfilling her official duties. The Colombian government cannot abandon her now.""""  Judge Sánchez received serious threats from Escobar and """"The Extraditables"""" (Los Extraditables), the drug traffickers who worked with him. In one message, """"The Extraditables"""" asserted that if Judge Sánchez charged Escobar, she would """"commit an error that would stain your life and would plague you until your dying day. You are perfectly aware that we are capable of executing [you] any place on the planet... be aware that if you call Mr. Pablo Escobar to trial, you will be without forbears or descendants in your genealogical tree."""" The threat went on to name numerous government employees already murdered on Escobar's orders.  At that time, the government took measures to protect Judge Sánchez, including moving her to a military base and assigning her an armored car. After indicting Escobar, Sánchez retired and was moved by the Colombian government to the post of consul in the city of Detroit, Michigan, for her safety. In 1989, however, her residence in the city became publicly known, which prompted another move to Washington, D.C., where Sánchez has served as consul since 1989.  The Escobar case remains active and continues to place Sánchez in danger. Several others connected to the case, including two judges, were murdered on Escobar's orders. Two associates linked to Cano's murder remain alive. Both President Gaviria and President Samper, two previous presidents of Colombia, extended Sánchez's security measures and reaffirmed her as consul in Washington.  In cases where public servants have received direct, credible, and continuing threats against their lives because they have fulfilled their duties, it is incumbent upon the government to take the necessary measures to protect their lives. Currently, many human rights defenders, government investigators, and journalists are under threat in Colombia because of their work. In some cases, the government has taken measures to protect threatened individuals, including allowing public servants to work outside the country.

Her work prompted immediate and serious threats from Escobar and """"The Extraditables,"""" the drug traffickers who worked with him. In one message, """"The Extraditables"""" asserted that if Judge Sánchez charged Escobar, she would """"commit an error that would stain your life and would plague you until your dying day. You are perfectly aware that we are capable of executing [you] any place on the planet... be aware that if you call Mr. Pablo Escobar to trial, you will be without forbears or descendants in your genealogical tree."""" The threat went on to name numerous government employees already murdered on Escobar's orders.  At the time, the government took measures to protect Judge Sánchez, which included moving her to the Club Militar and assigning her an armored car. Despite these threats, however, Judge Sánchez ordered Escobar arrested on August 26, 1988.  Judge Sánchez showed uncommon courage and dedication to the cause of justice in doing so. Indeed, she became an international symbol of the risks Colombians take to combat drug trafficking and was praised by many, including members of the U.S. Congress.  Due to the explicit threat against Judge Sánchez, she retired as a judge four days after issuing the order, and was moved by the Colombian government to the post of Colombian consul in the city of Detroit, Michigan, for her safety. In 1989, however, her residence in Detroit was made public, prompting another move to Washington, D.C. There, Sánchez has served as consul since 1989.  Far from concluded, the case she began by ordering Escobar's arrest remains active and continues to place Sánchez in danger. After the Colombian government chose to protect. Sánchez with a move to the United States, several others connected to the case, including two judges, were murdered on Escobar's orders.  The 1993 death of Pablo Escobar did not significantly improve Sánchez's security since several of his associates, including two others linked to Cano's murder, remain alive. Both President Gaviria and President Samper renewed Sánchez's security measures and kept her as consul in Washington.  In 1997, one of the intellectual authors of Cano's murder was arrested and later convicted of the crime. Subsequently, she received credible information from Colombia indicating that she and her family remain in danger.  In cases where public servants have received direct, credible, and continuing threats against their lives because they have fulfilled their duties, we believe it is incumbent upon the government to take the necessary measures to protect them. Certainly, this is an unusual case, given the ability of drug traffickers to carry out threats anywhere in Colombia and long after the principals involved are dead. However, this case merits exceptional treatment in accordance with the government's own commitment to uphold the law and protect human rights.  Currently, many human rights defenders, government investigators, and journalists are under threat because of their work. In some cases, the government has taken measures to protect threatened individuals, including allowing public servants to work outside the country. Given the seriousness of the threat against Sánchez and her family, we urge you to continue the measures adopted to ensure their safety.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/11/25/cold-shoulder-diplomacy","Cold Shoulder Diplomacy","Cold Shoulder Diplomacy","Recent ethnic conflict and civil strife have displaced millions of people -- and some of the world's richest countries are responding by pulling in their welcome mats","11/25/2000","With the approach of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, millions of people throughout the world are making plans to go home for the holidays. But for millions of others, there is no home to return to. Driven from their native lands by war, famine and human rights abuses, an estimated 14 million people worldwide will spend their holidays as refugees. An additional 30 million """"internally displaced persons"""" - international legal jargon for people who have suffered similar crises as refugees but who have not crossed an international border to escape - will be homeless as well. It's been half a century since the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was charged with the job of caring for victims of political turmoil and natural disaster. But as the UNHCR prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary, governments around the world are backpedaling on their commitments to the millions who have suffered the trauma of displacement. Most refugees flee to some of the poorest countries in the world, which, under international law, are bound to keep their borders open. But the post-Cold War era has meant a staggering rise in ethnic conflict and civil strife, and wealthier countries aren't doing enough to help. In addition to shirking their moral obligation to provide financial support to countries on the front line, the world's richest nations are adding to the problem by blocking the door to the relatively small number of asylum-seekers turning to them for help. That tendency, especially in Western Europe, threatens to do real damage to the carefully constructed but fragile system of refugee protection that has been built up over the past five decades. Refugees are treated dramatically differently, depending on where they end up. If you are an Afghan fleeing the Islamic fundamentalist regime in Kabul, you may hit the jackpot: Because you're fleeing religious persecution, which the U.S. government cares a lot about, you might become eligible for a resettlement program in the United States. If you were one of the refugees from Kosovo last year, you were also relatively lucky. Thanks to the engagement of the powerful governments of NATO, Kosovo refugees faced the shortest crisis and fastest return in history - about three months, from displacement to homecoming. But if you are a refugee in Guinea, where the roads are impassable during the rainy season, you may not even receive the modest rations of bulgar wheat and vegetable oil the World Food Program, another U.N. agency, is supposed to provide to every inhabitant of those camps. If you are a refugee in Tanzania who fled the civil war in Burundi, you are in danger of being raped when you leave the confines of the camp to forage for firewood (at increasingly long distances from the camp, as the surrounding area is progressively deforested). And if you are an internally displaced person in Ingushetia, fleeing the Russian offensive in Chechnya, you are really out of luck. The United Nations' distinction between refugees and internally displaced people has led to enormous and bizarre distortions in how these people are treated, leaving millions to struggle for survival without the international assistance, however meager, that refugees receive from UNHCR. The Russian government considers its Ingushetia problem an """"internal matter, """" and won't give humanitarian agencies full access to the people who have fled Chechnya for neighboring territories in the northern Caucasus. As a result, displaced families there live in camps of unheated train cars, in abandoned farm buildings, in mosques and warehouses, and with already over-stretched host families. They have limited access to food and health care, and there are few educational opportunities for the children. But no matter what your circumstances, nothing feels the same when you're a refugee. Certainly not the holidays: Research shows that refugees rarely celebrate anything in their first year of displacement. They keep thinking that they'll get to go home soon, and they don't want to carry on traditions that feel alien in a foreign place. But as time wears on, they give in, and begin to decorate their homes and cook their special meals to mark the holiday -whether it's spring festival in Asia, the end of Ramadan in the Middle East, or the Easter holiday in Christian Africa. Some end up marking those holidays for years, even decades, in forced exile. Many refugees lose hope of ever returning. They have been away so long that a generation of children has grown up without ever seeing their homeland. The largest and oldest refugee population in the world, some 6.4 million Palestinians, have been exiled from their homes in what is now Israel for more than 50 years. In South Asia, more than 100,000 refugees from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan have spent the last decade in refugee camps in neighboring Nepal. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, more than 1 million people displaced by warfare in the 1990s are still unable to go home. Throughout history, people have been forced from their homes by war, famine and human rights abuses. The UNHCR is the only global agency with the mandate to help - the first and last place that refugees turn to. Before UNHCR can get to work, it must be invited in by the country hosting the refugees. Most nations are eager to apply for the international assistance that UNHCR will bring them, although a few, such as India, guard their sovereignty so jealously they won't ask for help. The abiding tenet of international refugee law is that a refugee can't be sent home if it's not safe for him or her to go back. This tenet is frequently violated, however. In Thailand, for example, the government regularly deports refugees back to Burma, which is ruled by a highly repressive military government that provides no guarantees that refugees' lives or freedom will be protected. And in Pakistan, the government recently closed its borders to refugees from Afghanistan, forcing them to return to conditions of certain danger and insecurity. Once refugees have asylum in another country, they are entitled to various social, economic and legal rights under international refugee law. These include the right to family unity - to bring family members to live with them; the right to freedom of movement; the right to assistance and to work; and most important, the right to nondiscrimination in their new home. Finally, governments have a responsibility to work with UNHCR to find a solution to the plight of refugees. This usually means returning them to their country of origin once it is safe to go back. It can also mean permanent integration into the country of asylum, or resettlement to a third country, such as the United States. But although refugees are entitled to receive sanctuary and assistance from governments and the United Nations, the world has become a less hospitable place for them. Both the scope of the job and the way the UNHCR performs it have changed dramatically in the past five decades. Financial, logistic and security constraints limit its effectiveness, and growing resistance by governments, especially the European governments, serves as a roadblock to refugees. The United States accepted about 638,000 refugees and asylum-seekers in 1999. The problem is in the way that asylum-seekers are detained - they often wait for months or even years for a hearing. The Immigration and Naturalization Service sometimes mixes asylum-seekers, who may be fleeing grievous persecution, with people in lockups. Human Rights Watch has reported on teenagers from China and many countries in Latin America who are being held in juvenile facilities, even though they are not suspected of committing any crime. Some of these teens do not speak English and are thoroughly traumatized by their experience in detention. Human Rights Watch interviewed one child in a Pennsylvania facility who had been detained for five months without being able to speak to a single person in his own language. But the problems in the United States don't begin to compare to those caused by the massive, and sometimes very sudden, flows of people over borders when warfare breaks out. In these circumstances, the host government is often tempted to shirk its responsibilities under international law. And international donors - including the United States - are tempted to turn a blind eye. Even countries with a long and generous history of hosting refugees for decades are slowly hardening. A couple of years ago, the government of Tanzania rounded up tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring Burundi and dumped them in refugee camps in the western part of the country. Many of the refugees had been in the country since the early 1970s. """"My seven children were all born in Tanzania,"""" one woman told Human Rights Watch researchers. """"We get along with our neighbors. We contribute to the community. We helped to build the schools."""" But when fighters from the civil war in Burundi spilled over the border, the Tanzanian government sent military vehicles to her neighborhood, rounding up all foreigners and stripping them of their belongings. Her children were at school when she was taken away. When Human Rights Watch interviewed her more than six months later, she was living in a refugee camp in another part of the country and had not seen her children. As refugee crises proliferate in poor African countries, governments are beginning to explicitly target refugees as scapegoats and encourage local vigilantes to attack them. Unleashing these kinds of hatreds can be a convenient way for politicians to distract their own populations from a sluggish economy or a society rife with corruption. In September, the president of Guinea, Lansana Conte, closed the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia because rebels from those countries had conducted incursions onto Guinean territory. Conte also made two highly inflammatory speeches blaming refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia for the insecurity and general ills of his country. He called on the Guinean population to round up the foreigners - and they did, beating many people, raping women and sending terror through an already traumatized population. The people in charge of protecting those refugees have an increasingly dangerous job. On Sept. 6, three UNHCR staffers were murdered in Atambua, in West Timor. Less than two weeks later, Liberian rebels killed the head of the UNHCR office in the border town of Macenta, in Guinea. This incident caused the full withdrawal of humanitarian staff from the camps in West Timor, which still house about 125,000 refugees, and from the Guinean borders, where most of the half million refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia had taken shelter. These refugees are now largely unprotected and unassisted. But nowhere have the international standards for refugee protection been under greater attack than in Western Europe, North America and Australia - the very countries responsible for formulating the international law on this issue to begin with. The countries of the European Union have banded together to undertake """"fire- brigade policing"""" to try and keep asylum-seekers out. Most countries now require refugees to arrive at the airport with a visa - something virtually no refugee can get, for obvious reasons. If they don't have one, or if they try to forge documents to get into the country, they're not likely to get asylum. These nations' approach to refugees is not only mean-spirited - it sends a message to other countries that face much greater waves of displaced people and can much less afford to take care of them. If we ask that less-developed countries do so much when they have so little, can't we ask the same of ourselves? Something to think about over the holiday season.","Global",""

The international monitoring group called for the immediate and unconditional release of Muhammad Nazar, head of SIRA, a student coalition in support of a referendum on Aceh's political status.  Nazar, was arrested Monday night by police in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. He is currently detained in the district police lock-up but has access to visits from family members. """"Nazar and other SIRA activists are being punished for organizing a peaceful rally attended by hundreds of thousands of ordinary Acehnese,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"If this is incitement, Indonesian democracy is in serious trouble.""""  On November 11, SIRA organized a huge rally in Banda Aceh on the first anniversary of a similar demonstration last year that drew an even larger crowd. To prevent this year's gathering, Indonesian security forces fired on vehicles and boats trying to reach the capital, reportedly killing dozens of civilians. An investigation conducted by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission concluded that police had often fired directly on individuals, without warning shots.  On November 7, police had summoned Nazar for questioning, requesting him to report to the police station no later than November 9. On the advice of his lawyers, Nazar ignored the summons. On November 10, police raided the office of the steering committee for the rally and briefly detained three committee members. On Monday, November 20, Nazar decided to turn himself in. After hours of questioning, he was detained at the Aceh Besar district police station.  Nazar's arrest marks the first time that the government of Abdurrahman Wahid has used Articles 154 and 155, the so-called haatzai artikelen, or """"spreading hatred"""" articles of the Indonesian Criminal Code, against a political activist. Left over from the Dutch colonial administration, these statutes were used by the Soeharto government to punish free expression, including criticism of Soeharto himself, and to discourage pro-independence activities in East Timor. Human rights lawyers had hoped that in a democratic Indonesia, these articles would be repealed.  An active armed insurgency in Aceh has mounted numerous attacks on police and military personnel, leading government forces to step up counterinsurgency operations. Many unlawful killings and arbitrary arrests have taken place in the process.","Asia, Indonesia",""

""""Deliberate attacks on civilians are never justified,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Those behind this attack should be vigorously prosecuted."""" Responsibility for the attack is not known. It was claimed by at least three Palestinian armed groups. The Palestinian Authority denied responsibility for the bombing, which occurred in an area under Israeli security control.  The bus, carrying thirty children and adults, was reportedly ripped by shrapnel from a metal-encased mortar shell detonated by remote control. The attack killed Miriam Amitai, 35, a teacher, and Gavriel Biton, 34, a school maintenance worker, and maimed Orit, Tehila, and Yisrael Cohen. Orit, 12, and Yisrael, 7, each lost a leg, and Tehila, 9, lost a foot. Four other adults and two children were also injured.  Israeli forces have also been responsible for attacks on children. Since the beginning of the recent clashes on September 29, dozens of Palestinian children have been killed or gravely injured as a result of indiscriminate or excessive use of force by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Human Rights Watch is concerned that in at least some instances Israeli soldiers targeted children or fired recklessly into crowds that included children. While many of the children may have been involved in demonstrations or stone throwing, few, if any, posed an imminent threat to life that might have justified using lethal force against them.  Human Rights Watch investigated the October 6 fatal shooting near Hebron of 'Ala Mohammad Abdel Rahman Mahfouz, a 14-year-old who, according to witnesses, was targeted by an IDF soldier an hour or more after an incident in which the boy had thrown a rock that had hit another soldier. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that the soldier responsible later boasted that he intended to kill 'Ala in retaliation for hitting one of his comrades with a stone.  Human Rights Watch also investigated the September 30 incident in which 12-year-old Muhammad al-Dirra was killed at the Netzarim Junction in the Gaza Strip. In that case, heavy IDF fire continued for at least forty-five minutes after an initial exchange which may have involved Palestinian gunfire at the IDF bunker. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that about half an hour after commencing fire the IDF mortally wounded the boy and seriously wounded his father, who were huddled behind a water barrel, frantically trying to signal for help. According to witnesses, the boy and his father were not in the crossfire of earlier shooting, and at no point did they or anyone in their vicinity pose any threat to the IDF soldiers. Heavy IDF firing continued for another fifteen to twenty minutes, killing Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Bassam al-Bilbeysi and preventing the medical evaluation of Muhammad and his father.

As part of this dialogue, the E.U. should raise priority human rights issues including political prisoners, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), legislative changes, reinstatement of judges and professors, accountability for past abuse, and the status of refugees. There are encouraging initial signals that the authorities intend to provide redress for human rights violations perpetrated by the former government. For the future of the rule of law in Yugoslavia and the region, however, it is critically important that international actors, and the E.U. in particular, consistently press Belgrade to follow through on the positive steps undertaken so far. E.U. officials should make clear that eventual accession to the Council of Europe will hinge on attention to the crucial issues identified below, as will the disbursement of loans intended for general budgetary support. Human Rights Watch believes that humanitarian assistance, particularly to the health care sector and to municipalities, and assistance to nongovernmental organizations and the independent media should not be dependant on the central government's human rights record, but that other assistance should be strictly conditioned.The new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, and the transitional governments in Serbia and Yugoslavia, dominated by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), have expressed a wish to join the family of European democracies. The commitment that underlies this desire would prove credible if the authorities manifest a genuine respect for human rights and the rule of law. On such issues as the release of political prisoners and ICTY cooperation the new government can and should implement change as a matter of urgency. If the DOS makes as strong a showing as expected in the December 23 parliamentary elections and consolidates power, the authorities will also have the capacity to grapple with the remaining human rights and rule of law priorities. Human Rights Watch recommends that the E.U. press for the following improvements in human rights and the rule of law: Release of Political Prisoners Correcting the severe violations of due process perpetrated against hundreds of imprisoned Kosovo Albanians is an essential part of upholding the pledge by President Kostunica to respect human rights and reestablish the rule of law in Yugoslavia. An estimated 600 Albanian political prisoners, charged with either terrorism or hostile activity against the state, are currently imprisoned in Serbia. Courts sentenced Kosovo Albanians on the basis of forced confessions, and judges frequently refused to admit exculpatory evidence. These political prisoners should be released by presidential pardon or on the basis of an amnesty law currently being drafted by the Yugoslav Ministry of Justice. This must be done promptly, given that these prisoners have been unjustly deprived of liberty for eighteen months or longer.   Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Consistent with Yugoslavia's international obligations, the authorities should cooperate to the fullest extent with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Such cooperation in establishing the rule of law is a necessary condition for Yugoslavia's reintegration into Europe. This cooperation includes several specific measures:  Quickly authorizing the opening of an ICTY office in Belgrade; Complying with requests by the tribunal to provide assistance in relation to investigations and prosecutions. This includes, but is not limited to, allowing representatives of the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor access to Yugoslav territory; the identification and whereabouts of persons, the collection of evidence, including testimony under oath and material evidence; the serving of documents; the execution of searches and seizures; and the protection of victims and witnesses; Taking all possible measures to protect and safeguard documentation potentially relevant to ongoing investigations and future trials before the tribunal; and At the earliest opportunity, apprehending and transferring to the ICTY those individuals indicted by the tribunal.   Human Rights Watch is aware of the argument occasionally raised by Yugoslav officials that transfer to the ICTY is barred by a constitutional provision prohibiting extradition of Yugoslav citizens. However, transfer to an international tribunal constitutes surrender, and not """"extradition""""—which is the delivering up of a person by one state to another. For this reason, Human Rights Watch believes that the constitutional provision in question does not apply. Amnesty for Draft Evaders General amnesty should be declared for Yugoslav citizens who, in the absence of provisions for the determination of conscientious objector status or non-punitive alternative service, refused to be drafted or deserted during the war in 1999. Yugoslav human rights groups and lawyers believe that 10,000 criminal proceedings of this nature are under way, or already concluded with prison sentences, against draft evaders and deserters. A draft law, currently under consideration by the Yugoslav Ministry of Justice, provides for amnesty, and the parliament should uphold such a measure.   Legislative Changes Legislation curtailing fundamental human rights in Serbia should be repealed or amended as soon as the new Serbian parliament is elected and convenes. This should include the annulment of the 1998 University Act and the Public Information Act of October 1998, which have severely restricted academic freedom and freedom of information. New laws on the universities and the media should be crafted in cooperation with professional associations and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in thes respective areas. The parliament should amend the Serbian Penal Code to eliminate the death penalty, which is currently provided for certain types of murder in articles 47 and 169. The federal Criminal Procedure Act should be amended to provide explicitly for detainees' right to counsel immediately after detention and for law enforcement officers' obligation to inform detainees of their right to counsel. The absence of such provisions has been used by the police to physically abuse detainees to coerce them into confessions. A revised electoral law and regulations should be adopted to regulate the December 23 parliamentary elections in Serbia and the federal elections, which are likely to take place in 2001. Provisions in existing legislation that have enabled those in power to manipulate the electoral process must be eliminated. In particular, the following changes should be made: polling boards and electoral commissions should not be dominated by any political group; voting in the military should be administered by multiparty civilian agencies; all established candidates should have access to the media; the process of production and distribution of ballots should be transparent; voters should be able to countersign at the voting register in the polling station; and the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and domestic election monitors should be unimpeded. The Yugoslav parliament should amend the provisions on conscientious objection in the Law on the Armed Forces. The law mandates a punitive 24-month period for civilian service (article 296(2)), twice as long as armed service, and civilian service is required to take place in Yugoslav Army units or other military institutions (article 297(1)). The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that conscientious objection cannot be invoked when an individual who has already performed military service is called up to do reserve duties that involve taking up arms. The law should reduce the length of the civilian service, provide for service in civilian institutions, and protect a person's right to adopt new beliefs, as part of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Reinstatement of Dismissed Judges, Professors, and Journalists Judges removed from their posts for political reasons during the Milosevic period should be promptly reinstated by the Serbian parliament to be elected in the December 23 elections. Two judges of the Supreme Court of Serbia, one judge of the Constitutional Court, and seventeen judges of district, municipal, and commercial courts were removed in December 1999 and July 2000, although the Supreme Court had not pronounced upon the proposed removals, as required by law. The government of Slobodan Milosevic dismissed around one hundred professors and assistants at Belgrade University after the enactment of the oppressive University Act of 1998. The new Serbian Minister of Education has authorized each faculty to convene a commission to examine, on a case-by-case basis, all appointments and dismissals made under the 1998 act, thus avoiding the imposition of retroactive legislation or a blanket decision regarding faculty members hired since May 1998. The reviews should be carried out in a manner free of political pressure. In those instances where review commissions find that faculty members were fired for their political opposition to the Milosevic government, the affected faculty members should be invited to resume their old positions, or if that is not possible, offered a comparable position. Hundreds of journalists at the state-owned Radio Television Serbia were sent on compulsory leave for political reasons under the previous government, and at least four were fired. They should be given an opportunity to return to their positions, and those who have sued the RTS for the years of forced leave should be granted compensation. Bringing Human Rights Abusers to Justice The new authorities should take urgent measures to hold accountable the perpetrators of political killings, abductions, torture, illegal detentions, and violence against political opponents, and other abuses committed or alleged to have been committed by the forces of or the authority of the Serbian Ministry of Interior. Position of Refugees and Displaced Persons The new authorities should fully cooperate with the international community, and the UNHCR in particular, on the resolution of the status of refugees and displaced persons in Yugoslavia. The refugees should be given full and undistorted information on the return process in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, in order to enable them to make informed decisions on whether to return.","Europe/Central Asia, European Union","International Justice"

Solih, head of the Erk (Freedom) political party, has been in exile since 1994, when he fled arrest. He was the only genuine independent candidate to challenge Uzbek President Karimov in 1991 presidential elections. Trials in absentia violate international law, which stipulates that a defendant should be present at his own trial. """"Accusing the democratic opposition of violent crimes is a favored tactic of Uzbekistan's authoritarian government,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"These political show trials are only part of the Uzbek government's appalling human rights record.""""  State prosecutors had asked for the death penalty for Solih and nine others, but in a rare move the court handed down prison terms of 12 to 20 years instead. Uzbekistan is obligated under its 1999 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the European Union to move toward the abolition of the death penalty and to respect human rights. Nonetheless, the state continues to apply the death penalty and execute an unknown number of men by firing squad each year.  """"The E.U. and other states, especially the U.S., need to be sending a clear signal that political show trials are not a substitute for justice,"""" said Ms. Denber.  The two men sentenced to death were Tohir Yuldash, spokesman for the so-called Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and Jumaboi Namangani, the militant group's field commander, neither of whom was present at the trial. Three accused militants present in the dock received sentences ranging from 12 to 16 years. The government of Uzbekistan charged that IMU fighters—who this summer fought in pitched battles against soldiers from the Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan military— were in fact terrorists responsible for 1999 Tashkent  bombings that left 16 dead. The U.S. government placed the IMU on its list of international terrorist groups in September of this year.  In court, the state failed to provide material or sufficient evidence that the IMU or its leadership, which has denied involvement in the bombings, were responsible for terrorist acts in Uzbekistan.

The warrant charges the official with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch strongly supports the Belgian law and the principle of """"universal jurisdiction"""" that underlies it.  The Belgian law is part of a growing trend towards accountability for human rights crimes,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"Prosecutions based on universal jurisdiction are an essential part of the emerging system of international justice. They help to break down the wall of immunity with which tyrants and torturers protect themselves in their own countries.""""     The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has filed a petition to the International Court of Justice which will be heard on November 20. The petition asserts that the Belgian law violates The DRC'S territorial integrity, and that the international arrest warrant undercuts the diplomatic immunity of its acting Foreign Minister Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi. The warrant is based on a 1999 Belgian law that gives Belgian courts the authority to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes and other atrocities regardless of the crimes' connection to Belgium or the accused's presence on Belgian soil.     The warrant accuses Mr. Yerodia of war crimes and crimes against humanity because he made public calls for the Congolese population to kill members of the Tutsi ethnic group at the start of the rebellion against President Laurent Kabila in August 1998.     According to Human Rights Watch's own research, as the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army and its Congolese allies, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), advanced on Kinshasa in the summer of 1998, Congolese government officials exploited existing tensions between Tutsi and other ethnic groups for war propaganda. On August 4,1998 Abdoulaye Yerodia, then President Kabila's cabinet director, appeared on national television making thinly-veiled calls for ethnic attacks on Tutsis. As a result of these statements and other incitement, a large number of Tutsis in the DRC were slaughtered.     Human Rights Watch stressed that war crimes and crimes against humanity are still taking place right now in the DRC, and that an international justice mechanism urgently needs to be set up in order to hold accountable those from all sides in the civil war who are responsible for serious crimes. Since the beginning of 2000, hundreds of civilians have been slaughtered in the eastern DRC by the Rwandan army and its allies, the Goma-based RCD, who are fighting against the Kabila government. Armed groups that oppose the RCD and receive support from Kabila, such as Hutu armed groups and Mai Mai rebels, have also committed gross abuses against civilians, including widespread rape. There are also widespread abuses in the area controlled by the breakaway RCD Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) supported by Uganda.     Like the laws that permitted General Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London for crimes committed largely in Chile, the Belgian law is based on the rule of """"universal jurisdiction,"""" applicable to the most egregious atrocities. The rule, which was given explicit expression by the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II, recognizes that all states have an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of particular crimes of international concern, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims.     A principal reason why international law provides for universal jurisdiction is to ensure that there is no """"safe haven"""" for those responsible for the most serious crimes. The Belgian law resembles some legislation being adopted in other countries as they ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court.     Courts in Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland have applied laws based on universal jurisdiction to individuals accused of crimes arising out of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The effort to try General Augusto Pinochet was the most recent dramatic example of a prosecution for crimes with universal jurisdiction status. While Spain's effort to prosecute Pinochet did not ultimately succeed, the litigation had helped to allow victims in Chile bring cases that had previously been barred before Chilean courts because of the immunity Pinochet had enjoyed there. In August 2000, the Chilean Supreme Court lifted Pinochet's immunity for life.     Similarly, in February an investigative judge in Senegal issued a warrant for the former Chadian dictator, Hissène Habré, for acts of torture committed in Chad in the 1980s. That case is now on appeal as victims file cases in Chadian courts against Habré's accomplices.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Belgium, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Human Rights Watch voiced its concerns after a meeting with Minister of Interior Vasso Papandreou in Athens Wednesday. The meeting occurred as Human Rights Watch concluded an eighteen-day research mission that focused on the rights of migrants in Greece. """"The bill apparently fails to provide basic human rights protection for undocumented children and for other vulnerable migrants,"""" said Julia Hall, Human Rights Watch researcher conducting the investigation. """"We reminded the government of its obligations in this area under international law.""""  Areas of particular concern included:  Access to education-Under the draft law, children of undocumented migrants will not be permitted to attend school without proof of legal status. The proposed denial of access to education for these children is a violation of Greece's obligations under the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Access to Health Care-The proposed law denies undocumented migrants access to public health facilities except in undefined """"emergency"""" circumstances and incorporates a July 2000 Ministry of Health directive requiring mandatory reporting by staff when undocumented persons seek treatment. These measures could deter undocumented persons, including children, from seeking essential health services.  Access to Justice-The draft law fails to provide adequate redress for undocumented migrants when crimes (including police abuse) are committed against them. The law does not include protective measures for victims of trafficking and other crime victims, which would permit them to bring a claim against their perpetrators without fear of summary deportation. Human Rights Watch welcomed the proposed provisions on family reunification and encouraged the government to ensure that this progressive feature of the draft law be included in the final version.  Minister Papandreou also indicated that Parliament would consider a second phase of """"regularization"""" for undocumented migrants; the first phase ran from January 1998 until April 1999.  Human Rights Watch is a privately funded international non-governmental organization dedicated to monitoring human rights conditions throughout the world and advocating policies to address violations of international standards.

Security Council members to establish an international observer mission to monitor and report on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the continuing violent clashes in Gaza and the West Bank. November 14, 2000 Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch is writing to urge that the Security Council take prompt action to authorize the establishment of an international observer mission to monitor and report on the continuing violent clashes in Gaza and the West Bank. Serious and persistent violations of international human rights and humanitarian law have played a major part in sparking and sustaining these clashes. Monitoring and reporting on these violations should be at the core of the mission's mandate. As an impartial international presence, the mission could improve security for civilians while providing the international community with the independent and credible information needed to protect civilians. Human Rights Watch has sent two fact-finding teams to the region since the outbreak of violence on September 29. Our research has documented a pattern of excessive and indiscriminate use of lethal force by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) when responding to Palestinian protests. Violent attacks on civilians by Israeli settlers and Palestinians using guns and stones are also on the rise, often with the tacit consent of the authorities on each side. Israel is increasingly resorting to the use of heavy weaponry such as helicopter gunships, light rockets, and tank fire to respond to Palestinian rifle fire. Human Rights Watch is concerned that this escalation will increase the number of civilian casualties. The deployment of an international monitoring mission in this crisis has relevant precedents. There is currently a small international monitoring presence with a limited mandate in the city of Hebron, known as the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH). Residents of Hebron as well as independent international observers find that the TIPH has made a positive contribution to limiting tensions by providing accurate confidential reports about incidents to Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to the governments contributing to the mission, and by offering a platform for discussion between Israeli and Palestinian officials. The arrival of TIPH observers at the scene of incidents has reportedly helped to defuse a number of explosive situations. However, the impact of the TIPH mission is hampered by the strict limits placed on its mandate, which does not include a focus on human rights violations and prohibits TIPH monitors from publicly reporting their findings. To be most effective, an international monitoring presence in the West Bank and Gaza should have human rights at the center of its mandate, be empowered to report its findings publicly, especially in the absence of corrective action by the relevant authorities, and receive adequate resources to carry out its mandate. Human Rights Watch recommends that this mandate be established prior to the deployment of the monitors, and that it specifically empower and oblige the mission to:    1. Freely monitor and investigate human rights conditions:           * Receive complaints of human rights violations from any person or group is or who was in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.           * Travel freely and visit any site, including any suspected or known place of detention.           * Interview persons freely and in private, including detainees who have not yet been charged with a crime.     2. Monitor, report, and publicize abuses committed by Israeli and Palestinian security forces:           * Monitor the behavior of Israeli and Palestinian security forces and investigate incidents of harassment of or violence against civilians, as well as other human rights violations, including acts by private individuals undertaken with the explicit or tacit consent of authorities.           * Raise cases of violations of international human rights or humanitarian law with the appropriate authorities and recommend corrective action, including dismissal or prosecution.           * Report publicly violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, particularly in cases where the authorities have failed to take corrective action.           * Issue periodic public reports and briefings about the mission's activities and findings.     3. Monitor, report, and publicize conditions of detention:           * Monitor the treatment of persons in detention through regular visits to prisons, police stations, and suspected places of detention, including those located outside the Occupied Territories but holding persons detained in connection with the conflict.           * Interview detainees, freely and in private, including those who have not yet been charged with a crime.           * Raise objections with the authorities when access to detention facilities is denied or conditions deviate from international standards.           * Recommend corrective action, including dismissal or prosecution, and publicize those conditions when the authorities fail to take corrective action, including the prosecution of responsible officials.        The international community has deployed international monitoring missions to other areas of crisis, and the seriousness of this situation, as well as the regional implications of continued violence and widespread human violations, certainly warrant such a response now. A mission of this sort would establish an accurate picture of current patterns of rights violations and contribute to the restoration of a safe and secure environment for the civilian population.

Those we honor have shown great courage and dedication to the cause of human rights,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"They have worked tirelessly - often in deadly environments -- to expose rights abuses and to turn the international spotlight on their countries."""" The 2000 Human Rights Watch Annual Dinners in New York and Los Angeles will honor: a surgeon from Chechnya, a leading human rights lawyer in Sierra Leone, activists working to end so-called """"honor crimes"""" in Jordan, an advocate for the """"Untouchables"""" in India and an Uighur businesswoman from China, currently serving an eight-year prison term.  Human Rights Watch is a non-profit, international monitoring group with headquarters in New York. It accepts no financial support from any government.  The 2000 Human Rights Watch Honorees are:  Dr. Khassan Baiev (Russia) -- A doctor and surgeon, Khassan Baiev organized a hospital in his village in Chechnya when war returned in late 1999. He treated both Chechens and Russians, at one point performing more than 60 amputations in 48 hours. In January, a Chechen warlord threatened to execute him for treating Russian soldiers. Days later, his home was looted and burned by Russian forces. In February, many of his patients were executed by Russian forces, and Khassan had to flee when Russian forces labeled him a terrorist doctor for treating Chechen commander Shamil Basaev. Khassan kept a careful diary of abuses in the war, and provided detailed information on war crimes in Chechnya to Human Rights Watch.  More.. Abdul Tejan-Cole (Sierra Leone) -- Mr. Tejan-Cole is a prominent human rights lawyer in Sierra Leone, representing clients whose human rights and civil liberties have been violated. He is the human rights officer for Sierra Leone's Campaign for Good Governance and is also the coordinator of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in Sierra Leone, an organization that educates and advocates to promote fundamental human rights. Abdul's work during the on-going civil war in Sierra Leone has been brave and instrumental in bringing the gross human rights violations and atrocities to the world's attention.  More..  Martin Macwan (India) -- Martin Macwan is the Convenor of the National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights and the head of Navsarjan Trust, an organization in India's western state of Gujarat. Navsarjan works with Dalits, or untouchables in more than 2,000 villages, providing services ranging from legal aid to potable drinking water, to the the implementation of land reform and minimum wage legislation. The National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights has enlisted grassroots organizations in 14 Indian states and 11 countries to advocate on behalf of the 160 million Dalits. In December 1999, the campaign submitted 2.5 million signatures to India's prime minister demanding the abolition of untouchability and enforcement of national legislation. The movement -- which is likened to the movement for civil rights and racial equality in the United States in the 1960s -- is the first of its kind in size and scope for Dalits in India. More.. National Jordanian Campaign to Eliminate Crimes of Honor (Jordan) -- Consisting of 11 Jordanian men and women, the Committee has launched a campaign to abolish Article 340 of the Jordanian Penal Code, which gives lenient sentences (usually a few months or a few years) to those who kill in the name of honor. Between 25 to 30 women are killed in Jordan this way each year, for marrying someone their family does not approve of, for being raped, for suspected adultery, or for being the subject of a neighborhood rumor. These crimes are often committed by a male relative of the victim. The Committee has been gathering national and international support for the campaign, working to break down the silence that has traditionally surrounded violence against women in Jordan. Maha Abu Ayyash and Rana Husseini will be representing the National Jordanian Campaign to Eliminate Crimes of Honor.  More..  Rebiya Kadeer (China) -- Rebiya Kadeer has been in prison since March 1999. She will be honored by Human Rights Watch in absentia. Ms. Kadeer is from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. In August 1999, she was arrested by the Chinese authorities on charges of leaking state secrets and providing information about dissidents to Westerners. No member of her family has seen her since. She received an 8-year prison term and her appeal was turned down last week. Rebiya's son and secretary are also in detention as a result of their connection to her. Her husband, Sidik Rouzi, imprisoned earlier for campaigning against China's treatment of Uighurs, and has commented on Uighur issues for Radio Free Asia.

As student groups and nongovernmental organizations plan for a major rally in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh this weekend in support of a referendum on Aceh's political status, police and military units have been raiding NGO offices, arresting those involved in rally preparations, blocking transport, searching all vehicles headed for the capital, and shooting at rally participants trying to reach Banda Aceh. A similar rally last November 8 drew an estimated one million people to the capital. """"The Indonesian armed forces seem to be reverting to the worst days of the Soeharto era,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"In the misguided notion that the push for a referendum is led by GAM, the army and police are turning their guns on civilians."""" GAM is the acronym for Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or the Free Aceh Movement, a guerrilla group operating in Aceh since 1976. In the latest incident, armed police on Friday afternoon raided the office of an organization called PEMRAKA (Command Post of Concerned Students and Acehnese) and arrested three student leaders, all of whom were members of the steering committee for the rally. Muhammad Taufiq Abda, Iqbal Selian, and Bustami, all in their mid-twenties, were believed to be in detention in the Banda Aceh police station as of Friday night. Some twenty people are confirmed to have been killed in the last two days in efforts to travel to Banda Aceh for the rally. Some local organizations put the death toll at over one hundred. These violations are occurring even as senior Indonesian officials, led by the President, have publicly castigated the military for firing on demonstrators and activists, but thus far, nothing has been done to stop the shooting or arrest the perpetrators. Indonesian security forces are making no effort to distinguish between actions by the guerrillas and peaceful protest on the part of civilian, mostly student, organizations. Human Rights Watch called on Indonesia's donors and other governments to: 1. Express strong concern at the actions of Indonesian security forces to obstruct freedom of movement, assembly, and expression. These concerns should be raised immediately in connection with the rally. The upcoming APEC meeting in Brunei on November 15-16 would be an appropriate forum to raise ongoing concerns about lack of accountability for human rights violations in Aceh and apparent inability of Jakarta to control the behavior of local field commanders. 2. Send diplomats of Jakarta-based embassies to Aceh to review the situation with a view toward making direct demarches to the Indonesian government. 3. Use the new human rights legislation passed by the Indonesian parliament last week to intensify investigations and begin prosecutions into past and ongoing human rights abuses in Aceh.","Asia, Indonesia",""

The international monitoring organization also urged the international community to support relief operations for Afghan families who have been displaced by the current fighting in northern Afghanistan between the ruling Taliban and the opposition United Front. The Afghan refugees face real threats to their life and liberty if they are turned away,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Thursday that it had ordered the closure of entry points along the country's western border with Afghanistan. Pakistan claimed an inability to absorb the approximately 30,000 refugees who have arrived during the past two months and the thousands more who were expected to seek refuge in the coming weeks. The government of Tajikistan similarly sealed its border in mid-September, shortly after the Taliban's capture of the northeastern town of Taloqan prompted the flight of at least 70,000 local residents. Many of those displaced by the fighting in Afghanistan have reported that they feared the recurrence of abuses that had taken place during an earlier occupation of Taloqan by the Taliban, while others have stated that the recent offensive in the northeast had exposed them to grenade attacks and aerial bombardment. Human Rights Watch has gathered credible information about a range of abuses against civilians in other Taliban-held areas of northern Afghanistan from which refugees are now fleeing, including detentions of suspected United Front supporters, summary executions of prisoners, and forced conscription. These conditions have compounded the effects of a severe region-wide drought. Border closures and denial of asylum to those fleeing persecution amount to a violation of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement - the obligation of states not to return any refugee to a country where their life or freedom may be threatened. Tajikistan is a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the closure of its border with Afghanistan violates its obligations under the treaty. Although Pakistan is not a signatory to the Convention, it is still bound by obligations of non-refoulement under customary international law. """"Border closures are even more disturbing when the countries that deny entry to refugees play key roles in maintaining the armed conflict that is creating the refugee crisis,"""" Jones said. Pakistan is widely believed to provide the Taliban critical strategic support, and Islamic seminaries and refugee camps inside Pakistan have been an important source of recruitment for the Taliban. Tajikistan provides the sole supply routes for United Front commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, and its territory has been used as a base by his forces. Human Rights Watch also urged the international community to address the mounting humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan with increased support for relief operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan by humanitarian aid agencies. Pakistan is host to 1.2 million refugees - the second largest refugee population in the world. The vast majority of the refugees are Afghans, including many who have been resident in Pakistan since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. International assistance and attention for the Afghan refugee crisis has diminished over recent years and both Iran, which hosts the largest Afghan refugee population in the world, and Pakistan, have decried the chronic lack of international attention and funding.","Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Europe/Central Asia, Tajikistan","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Human Rights Watch noted that Vietnam has taken steps in recent years to address some human rights violations and has implemented social and economic reforms. Tens of thousands of political detainees and re-education camp inmates imprisoned in the 1980s and 1990s have been released, thousands of Vietnamese who fled abroad as refugees have returned without incident, and the government has shown some willingness to cooperate with the U.N. on human rights issues.  However, the government continues to seriously curtail fundamental freedoms—particularly freedom of expression by dissidents and freedom of association by independent religious groups and trade unions.

""""This can be part of a constructive exchange: President Clinton can offer technical assistance for reform and seek commitments for improvements in return."""" The U.S. could assist in the reform of Vietnam's press, criminal, and national security laws and help ensure its compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Vietnam has ratified. Human Rights Watch stressed that U.S. policy should focus not only on implementing the bilateral trade agreement signed this year with Vietnam, but also on obtaining concrete human rights improvements.  """"This historic visit is a crucial moment for the U.S. to send a clear signal to Hanoi on how progress on human rights will affect other aspects of the evolving bilateral relationship with the U.S.,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. The U.S. Congress has yet to vote on the new trade agreement.  Human Rights Watch urged Clinton during his visit to:  Call on Vietnam to immediately release all political and religious prisoners, and to cease surveillance and harassment of dissidents including those released from prison or detention. (See attached partial list of political and religious prisoners.) Emphasize that Vietnam's human rights and labor rights record will be carefully considered in the upcoming debate over Vietnam's trade agreement and its receiving Most Favored Nation (MFN) status. Encourage Vietnam to cooperate more fully with the U.N.'s human rights mechanisms and to implement the recommendations of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (which visited Vietnam in 1994) and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance (who visited Vietnam in 1998). The Working Group, among other things, called for better compliance with international standards on treatment of prisoners. The report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Religious Intolerance recommended that people imprisoned for their religious beliefs, upon their release from prison, should be allowed to resume their religious activities with full rights and freedoms. Support Vietnam's process of legal reform. That reform should address not only laws dealing with commercial matters but reforms of criminal, press and national security laws. Call on the Vietnamese government to introduce legislation that guarantees, both in the letter and in the application, the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, assembly, and association, and specifically to repeal Directive 31/CP on administrative detention. Encourage Vietnam to achieve greater transparency and accountability in its legal and penal systems and continue to press for the establishment of an independent and impartial judiciary. Press for access for international observers and independent monitors to trials and to persons held in prison or administrative detention. Urge the Vietnamese government to end its censorship and control over the domestic media, including the Internet and electronic communications, recognizing that a free press is essential in promoting civil and political rights.

Human Rights Watch welcomed the settlement, which would abolish the current practice of shackling youth in spread-eagled fashion as a form of punishment, known as """"four-pointing."""" It would also strictly limit the placement of youth in isolation cells and would restrict the use of handcuffs on youth to times when they are being transported. """"This is good news for kids in South Dakota,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But it's ridiculous that it took the state nine months to agree to protect them."""" Human Rights Watch wrote to Gov. William Janklow in March to decry abuses at the State Training School in Plankinton after receiving reports that it described as """"a stunning indictment of the state's juvenile detention system."""" The settlement agreement, which received preliminary approval by a federal judge on Monday, would end a class-action lawsuit brought in February against the state Department of Corrections by the Youth Law Center, based in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The state had initially sought to have the lawsuit dismissed on the technical ground that some of the juveniles named as plaintiffs were identified by pseudonyms. The use of pseudonyms to identify youth is common in litigation, particularly when they remain in detention. In addition to """"four-pointing"""" juvenile detainees, guards had routinely chained youth inside their cells and placed children in isolation twenty-three hours a day for extended periods of time, according to youth in detention and their parents. Girls held in the State Training School reported that they have been strip-searched by male guards, sprayed with pepper spray while naked, and handcuffed spread-eagled to their beds. Many of these abuses were recorded on videotape. Entering cells in teams of three or four while donned in riot gear, guards routinely filmed their efforts to subdue youth, including children charged with minor offenses such as skipping school. The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, enacted in 1974, requires states to remove all """"status offenders""""—those who commit acts that would not be crimes if committed by an adult, such as truancy or running away from home—from juvenile detention and correctional facilities. South Dakota is one of only a handful of states that do not comply with this federal mandate. The proposed settlement would also require the state to accept regular monitoring by the Youth Law Center, correct deficiencies in mental health care and education, and train detention center staff to work with troubled youth. If accepted by the judge, the state would have one year to implement the agreement.

At least 34 men known to have been mentally retarded have been executed since the death penalty was reinstituted in 1976. Some experts estimate that as many as 10 percent of the 3,000 men and women on the nation's Death Row have mental retardation. Many of the mentally retarded on Death Row have committed terrible murders. Intelligence is not a prerequisite for violence. But mentally retarded people are incapable of fully comprehending either the nature of their crimes or the nature of their punishment. They may be guilty, but their punishment should reflect their diminished culpability. If the death penalty is to be used at all, it should be imposed only on the most blameworthy offenders. By virtue of their mental impairment the mentally retarded can never meet that standard. Like children, they are incapable of calculated, mature evil. In 1989, a sharply divided Supreme Court reviewing Penry's case concluded that the 8th Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment did not preclude execution of the mentally retarded. It ruled there was insufficient evidence that the national """"standard of decency"""" had evolved far enough to reject such executions. Sadly, the standard of decency of almost every other country has evolved beyond that of the U.S. when it comes to the death penalty. There has been progress though: the federal government and twelve states now specifically exempt the retarded from capital punishment. Efforts are underway in several other states to ban the execution of the retarded. No one argues the mentally retarded should be excused entirely from criminal responsibility. But life imprisonment is sufficient to express society's outrage and grief at horrible crimes, to hold offenders accountable, and to protect society from further violence. It is time the U.S. joins the world in recognizing the senseless cruelty of executing anyone with the mind of a child.","United States",""

Florida is one of only thirteen states that deny the vote to ex-offenders who have fully served their sentences. A 1998 report by Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project estimated that 436,900 former felons were disenfranchised in the state. Among Florida's African American residents, the impact of the state's disenfranchisement laws is particularly dramatic: 31.2% of black men in Florida -- more than 200,000 potential black voters -- were excluded from the polls. Assuming the voting pattern of black ex-felons would have been similar to the vote by black residents in Florida generally, the inability of these ex-offenders to vote had a significant impact on the number voting for Vice President Gore.

Accession","","11/07/2000","The European Union has failed to take full advantage of an important  opportunity to promote human rights reform in Turkey, Human Rights Watch said. The E.U. today published its Accession Partnership for Turkey, essentially a list of steps Turkey must take to gain admission to the E.U. Human Rights Watch said while the document contained much that was of value, it had a disappointing lack of detail in key areas such as safeguards against torture, and protection of freedom of expression. """"The E.U. missed an unparalleled opportunity to apply leverage,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Human Rights Watch's researcher on Turkey. """"This is a disappointment. The Partnership Agreement should have had unambiguous benchmarks for human rights progress.""""  A Human Rights Watch report issued in September urged the E.U. commission to draw up a Partnership Agreement with clear benchmarks to signal that the E.U. was serious about Turkey's admission. The report recommended a detailed program to resolve Turkey's appalling human rights record.  Since the 1980 military coup, thousands of people in Turkey have been tortured; 450 people have died in police custody; at least 140 people have """"disappeared;"""" and more than two thousand people have been killed in political killings and extrajudicial executions. Even according to official figures, nearly half a million people have been displaced during clearances in mainly Kurdish villages when gendarmes ordered, threatened or burned villagers out of their homes. Police torture is still commonplace, and victims include children. Sexual assault or rape of women and men in custody are frequently reported. Sexual assault or rape of women and men in custody are frequently reported. Courts continue to sentence Turkish citizens to terms of imprisonment for voicing their non-violent opinions, and to shut down political parties for challenging the dominant ideology.  The Accession Partnership covers torture, the constraints on freedom of expression and association, and repression of civil society in overly broad terms, which the Turkish authorities may use to continue their traditional policy of delay and prevarication.  On the issue of language rights, the Accession Partnership document avoids mention of specific minorities but does set clear goals— the right to mother tongue broadcasting within a year and mother tongue education in the medium term—approximately four years. The document is also firm on abolition of the death penalty, and lifting Turkey's anomalous reservations to the 1951 Refugee Convention.  The single most important safeguard against torture is the abolition of incommunicado detention -- that is, police detention without access to legal counsel. This was recommended by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee against Torture nearly a decade ago and still has not happened. The document should have spelled out this problem as a matter of urgency.  On freedom of expression, the document goes little further than the E.U.'s earlier sincere but vague solicitations. There is no specific mention either of the right of conscientious objection or the headscarf ban which is denying thousands of women access to university education. The extensive violations committed by the Turkish security forces and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during the sixteen-year conflict in the southeast are left unresolved and treated as a conveniently closed chapter.  Human Rights Watch urges the Accession Partnership for Turkey to be strengthened by establishing clear benchmarks in the following areas:  Incommunicado detention should be abolished in law and practice. This means revising the Criminal Procedure Code to give all prisoners access to legal counsel from the first moments of police custody. Clear penalties should be demanded for police and gendarmerie officers who try to circumvent regulations. Blindfolding of detainees should be explicitly forbidden.  Permission should be given for the publication of the remaining eight reports of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture on their visits to Turkey.  Prosecutors and judges must immediately stop indicting or sentencing people for the expression of their non-violent opinions. Current practice contravenes Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which supersedes domestic law (according to the Turkish Constitution). Those imprisoned for their non-violent opinions should be promptly released and their political rights restored. The omission of conscientious objectors and women denied access to education because of the headscarf ban should also be addressed in the Accession Partnership.  The Turkish government should institute a full commission of inquiry, composed of independent experts, into the human rights and humanitarian law violations committed during the course of the fifteen year conflict with the PKK. Where violations are established to have taken place, those responsible should be brought to justice, and the victims compensated.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi Head of the Judiciary Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran Your Excellency: Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about the trials that have started behind closed doors of at least ten Iranians, apparently for attending and/or speaking at an international conference in Berlin, Germany on April 7 - 8, 2000. The charges against them, which have not yet been fully disclosed, include “engaging in propaganda against the national security of Iran.” We are concerned that these individuals, most of whom are prominent independent and reformist figures, are being prosecuted for exercising their basic right to freedom of expression. We are also alarmed that they are being tried before an exceptional court, the Revolutionary Court, whose procedures have in the past fallen far short of international standards for fair trial.    Human Rights Watch has learned that one of the defendants, Shahla Sherkat, the managing director of Women magazine, was summoned recently to appear before Revolutionary Court 3 in Tehran. When she arrived at the court on Sunday, October 29, she discovered that the trial proceedings were about to begin even before her lawyer had obtained access to the prosecution files. It appears that the remaining defendants (list appended) also received summonses to appear in court without allowing their lawyers the opportunity to have access to case files and to prepare their defense. In April, the defendants attended an international conference in Berlin on the future of Iran, which was also attended by banned and exiled political activists. This has been used by some conservative politicians to portray the defendants as persons linked to hostile foreign powers. The state-controlled Iranian media has described the event as anti-Iranian and anti-Islamic.    Hassan Youssefi Eshkevari, a religious scholar, has been held in prison since his return in August. His trial began in October before a Special Court for the Clergy. He is facing charges of apostasy, which may carry the death penalty. Mehrangiz Kar, a lawyer and women´s rights activist, and Shahla Lahidji, a publisher were detained for a few weeks in April and tried on Tuesday October 31 behind closed doors. Veteran independent politician Ezzatollah Sahabi, now more than seventy years of age, was detained upon his return from the conference and interrogated for more than six weeks before being released on bail. Sahabi was tried publicly today before the Revolutionary Court along with Alireza Alavi-Tabar, an editor, and Monirou Ravani-Pour, a writer. Two participants in the Berlin conference, Akbar Ganji, an investigative journalist, and Khalil Rostamkhani, have been held in prison since their return in April and May respectively. Your Excellency, the prosecution of these individuals is a violation of Iran´s obligation to uphold the right to freedom of expression as provided for in Article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which states:  Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. Furthermore, we are troubled by the manner of their summonses, which has not allowed their lawyers adequate time and access to the necessary court files. The court before which they are appearing raises further doubts about the fairness of this process. Iranian press reports on October 31 quoted Abassali Alizadeh, the head of Tehran´s Justice Department, as saying that these trials will be held in public, but some sessions have already begun in secret. Human Rights Watch is concerned that these prosecutions are a continuation of a pattern of repression against reformist and independent figures that has gathered momentum since February´s parliamentary elections.

Security Council Members on the Statute for the Special Court for Sierra Leone","","11/01/2000","Security Council Members   Your Excellency,     The establishment of a Special Court for Sierra Leone is an urgent and landmark test of the commitment of the international community to recognize and bring to justice the most responsible perpetrators of abuse in this exceptionally brutal conflict. To this end, Human Rights Watch welcomes the Report of the Secretary-General. However, we urge the Security Council to approve a statute for the Special Court whose terms will empower it to act effectively, and create a precedent for strong cooperation between national and international justice efforts. We believe that the proposed statute of the Special Court will require amendments to this end.       Of critical importance is that the Special Court be vested with Chapter VII powers of enforcing international cooperation at every stage. The Court must be able to depend on the timely cooperation and compliance of Member States with its requests and orders in all areas, including the production of witness testimony or other evidence, the service of warrants, and the search, arrest, and surrender of suspects to the Special Court. The proposed statute of the Special Court should be amended to incorporate at minimum the powers specified in Article 29 of the statute of the International Criminal Court for Former Yugoslavia and Article 28 of the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Security Council should also articulate a strong commitment to act should non-cooperation be reported under the revised statute.     We are especially concerned that the Special Court may not be able to consider evidence against the most culpable perpetrators of atrocities in Sierra Leone because of the proposed statute's restrictive scope of temporal jurisdiction. As currently drafted, the Special Court may try only crimes committed since November 30, 1996, rather than from the war's inception in March of 1991. Yet from its start, the war was marked by numerous massacres and other atrocities against civilians. Given the very minimal documentation of abuses as yet performed either by the government or civil society groups of Sierra Leone, a truncated scope of temporal jurisdiction may impose grave evidentiary hurdles to any prosecutor attempting to show the responsibility of those in command. For example, between March 15, 1997 and the signing of the Lomé Accord, Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, was in Nigeria under house arrest and imprisoned in Sierra Leone. Before an endorsement of the temporal jurisdiction provision is given by the Security Council, its members should carefully weigh the implications for successful prosecution of the most heinous crimes against the civilians of Sierra Leone, regardless of which party to the conflict committed them.     Human Rights Watch also recommends that the Special Court for Sierra Leone does not try persons who were under the age of eighteen at the time they allegedly committed a crime within the court's jurisdiction. Although we believe that children should be accountable for their offenses, in light of their inherent immaturity as well as the subjection of many child combatants to forcible abduction, brutalization and other forms of coercion, we recommend that the Special Court's limited resources would be far better used in pursuit of justice for adult offenders, rather than children.     We likewise recommend against the definition of the crime of recruitment of child soldiers as """"abduction and forced recruitment of children under the age of fifteen years into armed forces or groups for the purpose of using them to participate actively in hostilities."""" This formulation considerably narrows the well-established prohibition on any recruitment or use of children in Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the crime as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court, all treaties to which Sierra Leone is a party. The definition should be amended to include as a war crime any recruitment or use in hostilities of children under the age of fifteen.   Finally, we believe the Security Council, in approving a statute revised in accordance with the above recommendations, should reiterate its understanding that crimes of sexual violence may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. This principle, now firmly established in international law, should be explicitly endorsed to ensure that both international and local participants in the Special Court take such crimes within their mandate to aggressively investigate and prosecute.     Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

Published in The Baltimore Sun November 1, 2000 Maryland's commissioner of the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services, responded when asked recently about a federal investigation of conditions at the Baltimore City Detention Center, """"We're not the Hyatt of jails, but we are the Motel 6."""" I've stayed at plenty of Motel 6s during the three years that I've conducted prison investigations for Human Rights Watch. And I've been to a lot of jails. As far as jails go, the Baltimore City Detention Center ranks among the worst I've seen. I've stayed at plenty of Motel 6s during the three years that I've conducted prison investigations for Human Rights Watch. And I've been to a lot of jails. As far as jails go, the Baltimore City Detention Center ranks among the worst I've seen. As for Motel 6s, there's really no comparison. The U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation of the city jail Oct. 16 amid concerns that the 200-year-old facility is subjecting detainees to a """"life-threatening"""" environment. The Justice Department action followed a recommendation Human Rights Watch made in a November 1999 report that was based on an 11-month study of conditions at the jail. We found that youths held in the Baltimore City Detention Center faced daily risks to their personal safety. Even though inmate violence has fallen in recent years, it remains unacceptably high, in large part because the jail's crumbling infrastructure gives detainees many opportunities to fashion handmade weapons known as """"shanks."""" Even more disturbing were the credible accounts we heard that some guards at the jail permitted fights between youths, a practice known as the """"square dance."""" Detainees told us that some guards would ask the youths if any of them had any scores to settle. If so, the other detainees would be locked in their cells and the fight would be held in an 8-square-foot area on one of the tiers of cells. """"It ends up with busted heads, slashes over your eyes, broken fingers, cut lips, maybe a broken nose,"""" a former detainee told me in March. """"But you don't go to the hospital for the cuts. If you did, there'd have to be a report, and the guards would have to explain why two guys were out in the square while everybody else was locked in."""" In addition, jail officials routinely locked entire sections of the jail for extended periods, sometimes for a month or more. During lockdown, youths are permitted two or three showers a week and may attend classes, but they are otherwise restricted to their cells, denied contact with family members and prevented from attending religious services. And when the warden decides that a particular detainee is a safety risk -- even if there had been no prior misbehavior --he may place the detainee in permanent administrative segregation, a status that Baltimore jail officials call """"supermax."""" This system means that a youth may be held 23 hours a day in oppressive cell confinement without a hearing and without committing any offense while in the jail. When we visited in May 1999, the jail did not have a system to review """"supermax"""" placements. """"You're right,"""" Mr. Flanagan told me then. """"They can write to the warden, but I won't sit here and tell you that there's an adjudicatory process."""" Mental health services, another facet of the Justice Department's inquiry, were minimal to nonexistent in the city jail at the time of our investigation. Even though the jail added additional mental health staff after our report was released, in practice the only detainees who are able to access mental health services are those who are in crisis. Patients in the mental health unit were housed in deplorable conditions. When we toured the cells designated for suicide watches, we found that they lacked important safety elements and contained numerous objects that a detainee could use to hang or injure himself.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/31/sri-lanka-ethnic-violence-escalates","Sri Lanka- Ethnic Violence Escalates","Sri Lanka: Ethnic Violence Escalates","","10/31/2000","Human Rights Watch said today that ethnic violence in Sri Lanka would continue to escalate without decisive government action against those responsible for a prison massacre last week. The international monitoring group also called on all groups involved, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), to refrain from retaliatory attacks.  On October 25, twenty-five Tamils in a detention facility in Bandarawela were killed by a Sinhalese mob. Many of those killed had been detained on suspicion of links to the LTTE. Following the massacre, President Kumaratunga ordered two high-level police probes into the incident.  """"We welcome President Kumaratunga's swift action to set up high-level inquiries. We hope the investigations will proceed equally swiftly,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"It's critical that the government impartially investigate allegations that police personnel stationed at the camp were complicit in the attacks, and look into reports of incitement of violence by political parties preceding and following the massacre. With ethnic tension already so high, failure to address these highly-charged issues could be explosive.""""  A sharp rise in communal tensions has followed the attack, with some Sri Lankans describing the situation as worse than at any time in the last twenty years.  Ethnic clashes and large-scale riots erupted in Sri Lanka's central hill districts following the Tamil-led protests against the massacre. As many as four people were killed and many were injured in rioting from October 28 to 30 in the towns of Talawakale, Ginigathena and Nuwara Eliya.  In Talawakale, demonstrators set fire to Sinhalese shops after a drunken Sinhalese man reportedly abused the demonstrators. Sinhalese mobs retaliated, burning and looting Tamil shops. In Ginigathena, hundreds were driven from their homes after mobs set fire to local shops. Rioters also stoned vehicles on the main highway to Nuwara Eliya.  After the massacre, police briefly detained more than 250 suspects from the majority Sinhalese community. Several police officers who guarded the camp were also reportedly arrested. Curfews have been imposed and security has been stepped up in hill district towns to quell further protests and rioting. The unrest marks the first time in recent history that communal riots have broken out in tea estate areas where most of the 140,000 Tamils of Indian origin live.  Human Rights Watch also emphasized that the government must address the underlying causes of the uprising at the detention center, including prolonged detention without trial. Ahead of the massacre, inmates at the facility—many of whom may have been held without trial under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and other security laws—had been protesting conditions of their detention and allegedly took at least one security guard hostage. As news of an attempted inmate takeover spread, Sinhalese residents reportedly began amassing outside the camp and on the morning of October 25 stormed the facility.","Asia, Sri Lanka",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/31/xinjiang-chinas-restive-northwest","Xinjiang Chinas Restive Northwest","Xinjiang, China's Restive Northwest","","10/31/2000","Increasing separatist activity over the last five years in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in China's northwest is fueling ongoing repression in the region, with Chinese authorities carrying out large scale arrests, trials, and executions.  The collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence in the early 1990s of independent Central Asian states were key factors prompting Beijing to focus the central government's attention on a region that covers one-sixth of China's territory, but accounts for only 1.4 percent—seventeen million out of 1.2 billion—of its population. The region is home to eight million Uighurs, who have much closer religious, ethnic, and cultural ties with their independent neighbors than with the rest of China and who see in the new republics a model for their own independence. Part of the impetus behind the 1996 formation of the """"Shanghai Five""""—China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan—grew out of China's desire to enlist Russia and the new republics in its fight to contain any cross-border terrorism or religious and nationalist extremism in Xinjiang. As a result of meetings of the Shanghai Five, Kazakhstan ordered the dissolution of Uighur separatist organizations and extradited Uighur dissidents back to China, and Kyrgyzstan refused to allow the formation of a Uighur party in exile. The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, once best known as the site of Lop Nor, China's nuclear testing site, is better known today for its oil and natural gas producing potential, its prison network, and its Muslim nationalists, some of whom are believed to have links with groups in Afghanistan, Kashmir, Turkey, the Middle East, and many of the Central Asian republics. The human rights violations reported from Xinjiang are almost all linked to state efforts to curb separatist activity, as a major internal Chinese government policy document, the 1996 Document No. 7, well illustrates (see below). These violations range from arbitrary arrest and execution after summary trials to curbs on freedom of expression, association, and religion. A precise assessment of the human rights situation in Xinjiang is complicated by the fact that some sectors of the Uighur pro-separatist movement, unlike that in Tibet, have resorted to violent means in pursuit of national independence. In such a context, the Chinese government clearly has legitimate security concerns in the region. It is equally apparent, however, that the government has not made a clear distinction between peaceful expression and violent acts, and has taken a hardline approach to all expressions of separatism, exacerbating the situation and further radicalizing the opponents of Chinese rule. Although available evidence clearly indicates that human rights violations by the government are pervasive, the combination of restrictions on access and the absence of an international support network comparable to that of Tibet has meant that violations are poorly documented. Chinese premier Zhu Rongji's September 13, 2000 statement, that an """"iron fist"""" in Xinjiang is essential for combating threats to China's unity and social stability, left little doubt that the restrictive policies in effect in 1999-2000 will continue. Chinese officials may also be hoping that ongoing migration of Han Chinese into the region, economic development initiatives that will benefit the migrants and perhaps, incidentally, the Uighurs, and well-formulated propaganda offensives will dampen local enthusiasm for independence and stabilize the region. Roots of a Nationalist Movement Xinjiang (a Chinese name meaning """"New Frontier"""") has long been inhabited by a diverse mixture of Muslim peoples, including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Tajiks as well as the majority Uighurs. The region enjoyed independent statehood until 1759, when it was conquered by the imperial armies of China's Manchu dynasty, and periodic attempts at armed insurrection against Chinese rule occurred well into the twentieth century. The most significant of these was in 1945, when local forces took advantage of the looming civil war between Communist and Nationalist Chinese to revive the independent republic of East Turkestan, which survived until 1949 when it was crushed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The defeated Uighur leadership fled to Turkey, where an opposition movement is still based; and several other Uighur separatist groups set up headquarters in Almaty, the capital of neighboring Kazakhstan. During the 1950s, a large network of quasi-military Han settlements, known as the Production and Construction Corps (PCC) and populated mainly by demobilized soldiers, was established in the northern half of Xinjiang. Today, the PCC survives and prospers as a """"Stand-Alone Planning Unit,"""" reporting to and taking orders from the State Council, China's cabinet. Women and children account for one-half the population in the communities that make up the Corps. Besides accounting for much of the region's industrial and commercial output—predominantly cotton and livestock production, as well as gold, salt, iron, coal, and other types of mining—the PCC also administers, in some cases almost independently from Beijing, several dozen labor camps and prisons where long-term prisoners have for decades been dispatched from around China to serve out their sentences. (The northwestern part of Xinjiang contains probably the worst prison in the country, a uranium mining facility where inmates' average life expectancy is said to be appallingly low.) According to the official news media, the PCC has established no fewer than 170 urban settlements and some 2,000 villages across Xinjiang since 1949; the settlements are home to around 2.4 million settlers (one-seventh of Xinjiang's population), 90 percent of them Han; and, through the longstanding policy of """"combining economic and military functions,"""" the PCC serves as a bastion of Beijing's security preparedness in the region. The number of Han Chinese as a proportion of Xinjiang's population increased dramatically from 6 percent in 1949 to over 40 percent in 1978. With the onset of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in the 1980s, migration and settlement into Xinjiang increased again. Although absolute numbers of Han continued to grow, 1990 population estimates showed a slight drop in the proportion of Han Chinese in the region's population, a development likely due to Uighur birthrates higher than those of Han Chinese. The two main ethnic groups live in virtual segregation, with the former concentrated in the major urban areas and in the PCC areas, and the latter concentrated in the oasis zones in the rural south and southwestern parts of Xinjiang. In 1992, there were widespread reports that 100,000 inhabitants of the Three Gorges area of Sichuan and Hubei provinces would be resettled in Xinjiang as part of the massive population transfer program necessitated by construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Following opposition from those likely to be resettled in the region, and from the Corps itself, Beijing apparently shelved the proposal for several years. But, according to a June 10, 1999 report, authorities have begun to implement a revised plan to relocate Three Gorges residents to areas near Kashgar in southwestern Xinjiang. As the development agent, the PCC will receive a substantial payment for each relocated resident. Another source of contention is the central government's policy of allowing increasing numbers of migrant workers from China proper to take up seasonal employment in the PCC without obtaining the usual temporary residency and work permits; reports indicate that large numbers of these Han migrant workers remain in the PCC farm colonies as permanent settlers. It is notable that a mid-1990s State Council study advocated property rights for settlers. According to most independent accounts, there is substantial resentment among Uighurs toward the steadily growing Han immigrant population. While some senior government posts are allocated to Uighurs, the real administrative and political power resides in the parallel organizational hierarchy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP or Party), whose leading officials at all levels (except at the grassroots level in certain areas) are overwhelmingly Han Chinese. Thinly-veiled institutionalized discrimination against Uighurs and other Muslim groups is present in the educational system, where ethnic minority children attend their own schools and colleges but where the language of instruction at higher levels is Chinese, and where nighttime patrols are carried out in student dormitories to check that no prayers or other manifestation of religious worship are going on. Discrimination is also present in the administrative and business employment sector, in which the """"distinctive"""" religious, dietary, and linguistic characteristics of Muslims are used as a pretext to deny them access to positions of responsibility on the grounds that the employing unit is """"inadequately equipped"""" to meet their special needs.  Throughout the region, government controls on religious worship provide perhaps the most intense focus for Uighur anger and resentment. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), as part of the ultra-leftist Maoist policies that viewed inter-ethnic relations under socialism as consisting mainly of antagonistic relations between different """"social classes,"""" Islamic and other forms of religious worship were effectively outlawed as """"bourgeois"""" in nature; mosques throughout Xinjiang were closed; Muslim clerics were widely persecuted and jailed; Uighur families were forced to rear pigs in violation of religious prohibitions; and many mosques reportedly were used as pork warehouses. Under the more liberal central government policies inaugurated by Deng and Hu Yaobang in 1978, mosques reopened across the region and, for most of the 1980s, freedom of religion was afforded greater official protection in Xinjiang than at any time since 1949. Since the early 1990s, however, the growing strength of the Islamic cultural and religious movement in Xinjiang, combined with the politically centrifugal effects of the breakup of Soviet power in Central Asia, led the central government once again to impose increasingly tight restrictions on religious worship and practice in the region. Economic reforms began in Xinjiang, as in the rest of China, in the early 1980s, but instead of producing greater stability and social cohesiveness in the region, they seem only to have exacerbated the longstanding roots of ethnic, political, and religious discord between the local Uighur people and their mainly Han Chinese rulers. High on the list of specifically economic causes for such conflict are disputes over land and water-supply access, with newly established Han Chinese enterprises often monopolizing access to scarce natural resources at the expense of the indigenous rural population. One noteworthy example is in the region's fast-growing cotton industry, which consumes prodigious amounts of both land and water. Increased resource scarcity is often accompanied by extensive environmental damage, including rising levels of soil salination and increased desertification. Channels of complaint or official redress, moreover, are often severely curtailed. Although the PCC is reportedly among the worst offenders in resource-related disputes, local Uighur communities are in most cases unable to pursue legal action because the PCC is """"autonomous"""" even in judicial matters: they have their own system of courts and police. Beijing's current drive to expand the PLA's institutional presence in Xinjiang, especially in the south, also is placing an additional economic burden on the local indigenous population, which is required to pay increased taxes to support the """"fraternal"""" military deployment. The large-scale riots that rocked the city of Yining in early February 1997 and that were suppressed with considerable violence by the local authorities, along with a continuing series of bomb attacks against Chinese targets by alleged Uighur activists, were only the most visible and dramatic manifestation of rising tensions in Xinjiang. The precise origins of the troubles in Yining (known locally as Ghulja) are unclear, but large-scale street demonstrations staged by local Uighurs during the last week of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan appear to have been sharply exacerbated by the government's decision to send in armed anti-riot police units at the initial stages of the protests, thereby fueling further public animosity. The government immediately imposed a news blackout on the city, closed the border with Kazakhstan, and attributed the clashes that then raged for several days across the city to """"hostile foreign forces."""" According to the official count, ten people were killed, 198 were injured, and around 500 demonstrators were arrested. Exiled Uighur groups estimated the numbers of dead, injured, and detained to have been many times higher. Earlier incidents in the region included the Baren uprising of April 1990, in which an entire Uighur township in the vicinity of Kashgar reportedly rose in armed rebellion against the local Han authorities, who responded with massive military force. A reliable tally of the casualties at Baren may never be known. According to the government, the death toll came to around twenty, but Uighur sources claimed that several hundred rebels were killed. Similarly, a definitive account of a major confrontation between Uighurs and armed police, sparked by the reported arrest of a young imam in July 1995 in Hotan, remains unavailable. China's Strategy for Curbing Separatism: Document No. 7 In March 1996, the Standing Committee of the CCP Politburo—the seven most powerful men in China—convened a special session to discuss the """"Xinjiang question."""" The official record of that meeting, Document No. 7, a secret document obtained by Human Rights Watch in late 1997, is a clear indication that Beijing had reasserted central leadership control over the region. The ominous human rights implications of the document make it all the more important that Chinese authorities be pressed to lift restrictions on access to the area by journalists and human rights monitors.  Document No. 7 covered ten major issues ranging from intensified controls over religious activity to the need for wholesale reinforcement of military and security preparedness to collaboration with China's neighbors to counter what the leadership viewed as U.S.-led efforts inside China and overseas to destabilize the region. As evidence of the growing problem, the document cited alarming """"semi-open"""" incidents such as """"the instigation of problematic situations, the breaking-and entering of Party government offices and explosions and terrorism."""" The document suggested a range of counter strategies, beginning with the transfer to Xinjiang of large numbers of """"reliable"""" Party cadres from China proper to replace indigenous cadres, especially in villages where the latter adhere to religious beliefs. """"Rule of law"""" was emphasized as an antidote to """"the infiltration and sabotaging activities of foreign religious powers."""" Specific measures included: curbs on """"all illegal religious activities...(and) the building of new mosques;"""" speedy replacement of supporters of separatism and of mosque leaders who are not """"loyalists;"""" a crackdown on illegal underground religious schools, kung-fu schools, and Koran study meetings; identification of and tight control over underground religious students; and training of a new generation of """"patriotic"""" ethnic religious leaders  Document No.7 went on to mandate the purging from the CCP of ethnic Uighur cadres who """"believe in religion and refuse to change"""" even after intense cultural, educational, and ideological indoctrination. (Party members must be atheists.) That """"cleansing"""" campaign extended to the schools, targeting textbooks, curricula, recalcitrant students, teachers, and exchange programs. It also included a ban on published materials and tapes which deviated from the Party's line on regional history, further compromising academic freedom. Finally, Document No.7 called for full-scale mobilization and cooperation by all levels of China's security apparatus, including its intelligence gathering and prison management units, in preparation for potential large-scale social unrest in the region, particularly in southern Xinjiang, home to the bulk of the Uighur population. To this end, the document envisioned an expanded role for the Production and Construction Corps network, especially in the south where conflicts with indigenous farmers and nomads over grasslands and water usage are endemic. It also ordered the strengthening of the fighting capacity and ideological preparedness of People's Liberation Army forces. Document No.7 did not directly address what appears to be an important aspect of central government policy: undermining separatism through population, economic, and fiscal policies. The Western Big Development Project, announced in June 1999, is part of that effort. It commits the Chinese leadership to escalating development efforts in poor inland regions, including Xinjiang, through promotion of large-scale infrastructure projects such as rail links, roads, and telecommunications essential for high-tech industrial growth. The announced plan is for investment of 420 billion renminbi (approximately U.S. $ 52 billion) in fixed assets during 2001-2005 in Xinjiang alone. Development of a natural gas pipeline from Xinjiang to Shanghai is one crucial project; others promote the growth of the oil industry in the region. The promise of a decent standard of living from large-scale cotton cultivation or work in the textile industry has already attracted migrants. A good portion of the projected improvement is to be concentrated in the poorer, rural, predominately Uighur southern section. A mid-1990s State Council report urged recruitment of young workers from other parts of China for the desert areas. PCC-managed reclamation projects there have already attracted thousands of migrants. There has been active recruiting to one predominately Uighur area where land is in short supply. Better access has helped. The South Xinjiang railroad linking Urumqi, the region's capital located in northern Xinjiang, to Kashgar in the south, opened in December 1999. Until 1995, it was slow and expensive to move people and goods along the one decent road in the area. A trade center is due to be completed in the Kashgar region in May 2001. Even as officials have promoted migration, they have discouraged Uighurs from having large families. In July 2000, the Chinese government announced 180 million renminbi (approximately U.S. $22 million) to enhance family planning services in poor western regions. In March 2000, a government directive implied that the relatively lenient policy that had been in place for minority populations would be rescinded, adding that provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities would be issuing specific regulations.  The """"Strike Hard"""" Campaign in Xinjiang In April 1996—one month after the Politburo's Standing Committee met and agreed on the policies summarized in Document No. 7—the central government announced the launching of the country's most severe and extensive """"Strike Hard"""" (Yan Da) campaign since the fall of 1983, when the first of the periodic anti-crime campaigns took place. In Xinjiang, the scope of the 1996 Strike Hard campaign was specifically extended by the central government beyond """"major common criminals,"""" the focus of the campaign throughout most of China, to include """"ethnic splittists"""" and """"illegal religious"""" forces in the region. The campaign resulted in hundreds of thousands of arrests and several thousand judicial executions across China. In Xinjiang, too, the campaign more than lived up to its description by the authorities as a """"quasi-military action.""""  In the area of official religious policy, the implications of Strike Hard were spelled out in Xinjiang Ribao, the official daily newspaper, in September 1996. New rules prohibited """"outsiders"""" from conducting religious activities and mandated enrollment of religious leaders in government-run training courses and on-going monitoring of their progress. The Yining riots in February 1997 and a bombing incident soon afterwards in Urumqi led to dozens of executions over the next few years and dozens of long prison sentences. According to a June 1997 Xinjiang Ribao report, a major purge of local officials, some 260 in all, took place in Ili Prefecture, as did a crackdown on """"underground"""" religious activities which included a ban on the construction or renovation of 133 mosques in the area. Altogether forty-four """"core participants in illegal religious activities"""" were arrested. In addition, security forces broke up more than one hundred """"illegal classes"""" where the Koran was taught, five school principals were fired, and numerous teachers threatened with dismissal for allegedly stirring up separatist sentiment. The report even boasted that in Ili, """"illegal religious activities were cleaned up...district by district, village by village and hamlet by hamlet."""" According to the United National Revolutionary Front, a Uighur nationalist group based at the time in Kazakhstan, the crackdown was not confined to Yining, but extended to the town of Turpan, where schools and mosques were searched. Meanwhile, thousands of common criminals were rounded up across the region and summarily sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, or even death, after trials that fell far short of international standards. In many of the reported cases, it was left unspecified as to whether or not those referred to as """"national splittists,"""" """"terrorists,"""" and the like had in fact been responsible for any kind of violent activities against the state. It was quite clear, however, that the government had made unauthorized religious activity and pro-separatist sentiment two of the prime targets of the Strike Hard campaign in Xinjiang. Those targets did not change after the Chinese leadership declared that Strike Hard would become a permanent feature of life in China. Government reliance on hardline tactics, surveillance, and reeducation The government has continued to apply harsh policies in Xinjiang. So far this year, authorities have executed at least twenty-four alleged terrorists, most of them Uighurs. Scores more have been sentenced to life imprisonment, often after forced """"confessions,"""" closed trials, and public sentencing rallies. Unknown numbers are detained in lockups. Escapees have reported that the police hold their families as de facto hostages until they return to Xinjiang to face arrest. The tactic is clearly aimed at breaking links between separatists operating within and outside Xinjiang and at preventing information about human rights abuses from circulating outside China. A December 1999 Ministry of State Security circular—emphasizing the need to contain infiltrators from Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf States—betrays a similar purpose.  In March 2000, Rebiya Kadeer, a prominent Uighur businesswoman whose husband is a political refugee in the U.S., received an eight-year sentence for """"illegally passing intelligence outside China."""" She had sent her husband copies of local publicly available newspapers. Her son and her secretary, detained with her in August 1999 just before she was to meet with U.S. congressional staffers, are serving administrative sentences. The Chinese government continues to punish peaceful opposition to its policies. Publications continued to be targeted. In March 1998, in a crackdown against """"illegal publishing"""" in Urumqi, the authorities banned books with """"serious political problems"""" and confiscated and destroyed """"illegal religious publications which distort the Party's nationalities policy and undermine national unity."""" In December 1999, the regional Press and Publications Bureau and the Urumqi City Bureau for Industry and Commerce revoked the license of a printer for publishing """"propaganda."""" All religious materials, even scripture, had to be approved prior to printing.  An official report in April 2000 stated that eighteen people had been sentenced for possession of """"reactionary"""" materials and formation of an organization threatening to national unity. In May 2000, Xinjiang authorities detained a man named Ibrahim who ran a language school in a building owned by Rebiya Kadeer. After the school added Arabic courses to its Chinese and English offerings, authorities reportedly noted that new students were wearing clothing indicative of Islamic beliefs and concluded that the school was operating as an unregistered and illegal religious institution and had become a center for the propagation of separatist activities. Ibrahim had also been involved in setting up an organization called Hizbut that had begun to plan for the distribution of leaflets advocating Islamic law. 108 Hizbut organizers were detained together with Ibrahim.  In May 2000, a massive intimidation campaign reportedly was underway near the border with Pakistan. According to an official account, thousands of cadres went from house to house warning of the dangers of ethnic separatism, religious extremists, and alleged local terrorist activities. Xinjiang, they said, had always been a part of China. The implicit warning appeared to be that any expression or activity suggesting otherwise would be crushed.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/30/azerbaijan-government-interferes-parliamentary-election","Azerbaijan- Government Interferes in Parliamentary Election","Azerbaijan: Government Interferes in Parliamentary Election","A Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","10/30/2000","Parliamentary elections scheduled for November 5 were to have been a test of Azerbaijan's commitment to the rule of law and to its obligations as a country seeking accession to join the Council of Europe. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted on June 28 to recommend to the Committee of Ministers that Azerbaijan be admitted to the Council of Europe and asked Azerbaijan """"to ensure that its planned elections be free and impartial."""" The Council of Ministers is unlikely to vote on Azerbaijan's accession until after the parliamentary vote. The Azerbaijani government's human rights record in the pre-election period has been a step backward from its commitments, in a repetition of patterns seen in other countries across the southern tier of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Information gathered by Human Rights Watch researchers in Azerbaijan since October 4 confirms the reports compiled by domestic monitoring groups of massive government interference in pre-election processes, mainly with regard to candidate registration. Local governments used delaying tactics to prevent opposition candidates from completing the registration process in time, and intimidated those who gathered signatures for opposition candidates's registration and citizens who signed nomination sheets. Once candidates completed the registration process, election commissions arbitrarily declared their signature lists invalid, blocking access to the ballot for hundreds of independent, opposition, and other candidates who had completed requirements for registration. No independent domestic groups are permitted to monitor the vote. For months prior to the elections, the government attempted to intimidate the opposition-affiliated and independent media. This short background paper will present selected instances of this interference compiled by Human Rights Watch. These actions clearly contravene the Azerbaijani government's commitments to the Council of Europe and violate its obligations under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Copenhagen document, which elaborates standards for the conduct of free and fair elections, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Azerbaijan is a party. Background   Since Azerbaijan's independence, and particularly since the overthrow of the Popular Front government in 1993, opposition political parties have gained strength and participated in contested elections. The government, however, has consistently exercised its overwhelming power to control and manipulate electoral processes. International and domestic observers found that Azerbaijan's first parliamentary post-independence elections, held in November 1995, the October 1998 presidential elections, and the country's first municipal elections of December 1999 and March 2000 fell far short of established international standards. Hopes that the 2000 parliamentary vote would improve on past failings have largely withered, particularly after steps the government has taken in the wake of the June 28 Council of Europe accession vote. In fact, several provisions of recently enacted electoral laws actually retreat from relatively more democratic rules that governed previous elections. Government actions over the preceding months against those identified by domestic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as political prisoners also add to the atmosphere of fear and intimidation, and further constitute an implicit threat against opposition activists. Under international pressure to implement OSCE recommendations on electoral law and practice issued after the 1998 presidential poll, and to prove its democratic credentials in advance of the Council of Europe accession vote, this summer Azerbaijan undertook to amend its laws on the composition of the Central Electoral Commission, the Law on Parliamentary Elections, and the Law on Nongovernmental Organizations. However, the final versions of these laws contain provisions which represented a step backwards from its commitments. Unlike previous election legislation, the Law on Parliamentary Elections, as passed on July 5, contains no separate article regulating the participation of domestic observers, although one article regulates the participation of international observers. The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), other international organizations, and foreign governments have protested that article 8 of the OSCE Copenhagen document clearly provides for the participation of domestic electoral observers. The Law on Nongovernmental Organizations, which entered into force on October 6, explicitly prohibits NGOs that receive foreign funding from acting as election observers. As a result, the Azerbaijani NGO """"For the Sake of Civil Society,"""" cannot monitor the November 5 vote. This organization had monitored the 1998 presidential and 1999 municipal elections and issued scathing reports about them. Reportedly, the Central Electoral Commission is currently considering whether to register individual monitors from the list submitted by """"For the Sake of Civil Society"""" on September 26. Amendments to both the Law on Parliamentary Elections and the Law on the Central Electoral Commission backtracked from improvements contained in the original versions of the laws as enacted in early July, immediately after the Council of Europe vote. When both laws were under discussion in parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) based its decision to approve accession on commitments it had received from President Aliev to implement """"substantial democratic reforms,"""" including the revision of election legislation, """"so that the next general election in autumn 2000 can confirm definitively the progress made...."""" The Central Election Commission law as adopted on June 9 provided for one-third of the eighteen members to be appointed from opposition parties, one-third from President Aliev's ruling party, Yeni Azerbaycan (New Azerbaijan, or YAP) party, and for one-third to be independents, originally required two-thirds majorities for any decision, and mandated a two-thirds quorum was required to hold a vote. After opposition members boycotted the first sittings of the Central Electoral Commission to protest the adoption of the Law on Parliamentary Elections, the parliament amended the Central Electoral Commission law to remove the two-thirds majority provisions. Other reversals occurred between readings of draft versions and the final passage of the Law on Parliamentary Elections. As discussed in parliament in June, the law envisioned the participation of civil society and opposition political parties in the formation of territorial election commissions and precinct commissions; the final version of the law, passed on July 5, allows the Central Electoral Commission to directly appoint territorial commission members (who in turn appoint the precinct commissions). Also, the final version of the law, in contrast to the draft, requires persons wishing to appeal a territorial commission's refusals to register their candidacies to first obtain a ruling from the Central Electoral Commission before filing suit in court. If the legislative framework for the elections established electoral commissions of questionable partiality, the first proof of bias came on September 11, when the Central Electoral Commission refused to register the candidate lists of eight political parties which had applied to contest the twenty-five seats to be allocated by proportional representation, based on the overall vote received by each party. Earlier, international organizations monitoring elections were heartened by the August 28 Constitutional Court decision which invalidated a provision of the election law that had required parties wishing to contest the elections to have been registered at least six months in advance of the announcement of the elections. The OSCE/ODIHR and other international actors outspokenly urged the government of Azerbaijan to allow all registered political parties fielding candidates access to the balloting for the proportional mandate seats. President Aliev garnered their praise when he appealed to the CEC to reverse its decision not to register the political parties, among them the most powerful opposition groups. On October 8 the Central Electoral Commission complied with his request and registered the parties, a move that belied the Commission's independence; many in Azerbaijan have challenged the legality of this action. Police have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations at which people protested the government's electoral policy. On October 28, a group of about 400 gathered near the Gabala cinema to demand the registration of Civic Unity, an unregistered party affiliated with Ayaz Mutalibov, who was president of Azerbaijan at the time of independence. Several minutes after protesters gathered at 4:00 p.m., police ordered them to disperse. Police beat the peaceful protesters, including those who were dispersing, inflicting wounds to the head and neck. Human Rights Watch researchers saw at least ten injured protesters with red marks from police batons and open wounds; many others had presumably run away. This recalled the break-up of the April 29 demonstration protesting the election law; at least fifty people were injured as a result of police violence then. Another important Council of Europe recommendation issued in advance of the accession vote asked the government """"to release or to grant a new trial to those prisoners who are regarded as 'political prisoners' by human rights protection organisations, especially Mr. Iskander Gamidov, Mr. Alikram Gumbatov and Mr. Raqim Gaziyev,"""" respectively a former minister of internal affairs, a leader of a failed uprising, and a former minister of defense. Accordingly, in June, President Aliev issued a decree providing amnesty to many political prisoners; the president also signed an agreement to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross access to places of detention. As of October, 125 prisoners were released by presidential pardon, although the three specified by the Council of Europe were not affected. Casting serious doubt on official statements that these were the last political prisoners in Azerbaijan, however, human rights groups claimed hundreds remained in custody, chiefly those convicted on charges related to terrorism, alleged coup attempts, ethnic separatism, illegal weapons possession, and abuse of office. Moreover, several domestic human rights activists complained that conditions for political prisoners are worsening in Azerbaijan. In September, approximately nine political prisoners of Correctional Labor Institution (Colony) No. 11 were transferred to the high-security Gobustan prison after prison authorities allegedly falsely charged them with violating prison regulations; at least nine more were transferred from other facilities. Under a new penal code that entered into force in September many prisoners with good records would have been eligible for early release and those on death row could have come up for clemency had they had records of good behavior. Azerbaijan's record of backtracking on its commitments on democratization, particularly those made to the Council of Europe, gained broader meaning in a statement by the head of the Presidential Administration, Ramiz Mehtiev. In October he announced that Azerbaijan does not consider any Council of Europe recommendations on democratization to be legally binding, and that attempts to pressure their adoption should be considered as infringements on the country's sovereignty.  Pre-election Conditions In violation of Azerbaijani domestic law and the country's international commitments, local government authorities are engaging in widespread and systematic interference in electoral procedures, principally by blocking access to the ballot for opposition and independent candidates in the country's one-hundred single-mandate constituencies. Central Electoral Commission member Ilgar Abbasov (independent) acknowledged, in an interview with the independent daily Zerkalo (The Mirror) published October 12, that as in previous elections, some local executives are """"excessively active."""" Adil Ismailov, a Baku-based lawyer for five prospective candidates, told Human Rights Watch, """"the local executive power operates everything and the election commission member are obliged to do what they say."""" In response, a coalition of nongovernmental organizations has created a telephone hotline, the Line for the Protection of Electoral Rights, which as of mid-October has received hundreds of complaints. At the end of the registration period, 817 individuals had submitted registration materials to their territorial electoral commissions. Those commissions registered only 409 single-mandate candidates, and rejected the remaining 408 applications. Many of those whose registration applications were refused simply withdrew their candidacies. Some would-be candidates never received the necessary signature collection forms from their local commissions in order even to begin the process of registration. Most of those refused registration are affiliated with opposition political parties or are independents, although in at least six cases, according to the Baku-based Human Rights Resource Center, similar obstacles have been created for members of the ruling party.  Obstacles to Candidate Registration In violation of explicit provisions of the Law on Parliamentary Elections, local government officials exert persistent and decisive pressure on territorial electoral commissions to restrict access to those candidates the government favors. At least 150 rejected candidates have united to form the Rights Defense Committee of Unregistered Candidates, asserting in an October 24 press conference that they have received a """"flood-tide"""" of reports of electoral law violations by government bodies. Territorial electoral commissions find various pretexts to block undesirable candidates, mainly by disqualifying signatures given in their support. According to the Law on Parliamentary Elections, territorial electoral commissions are required to provide official signature sheets, on which the potential candidates must gather at least 2,000 (but reportedly not more than 2,300) signatures and passport information from residents of their electoral district. After the sheets are submitted, the commission chooses at least 15 percent of the signatures to verify by lottery; candidates are present for this process. Any missing, incorrect, or false information may invalidate a signature. If fewer than 2,000 valid signatures remain, the application for candidacy must be rejected. Human Rights Watch has interviewed twelve would-be candidates whose applications have been rejected; what follows is a representative sample of government election law violations they have encountered.  Refusal to issue or to accept applications Although the law requires territorial electoral commissions (TECs) to provide all potential candidates with signature sheets immediately upon application, many cases have surfaced in which these bodies delay or even refuse to issue them. Chingiz Rahimov, an independent whose candidacy was first registered, but then repealed by TEC #5 in Julfa Ordubat district of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, recalled that although he applied at the same time as a YAP candidate, he did not receive the signature sheets until five days later. He told Human Rights Watch, """"The TEC secretary told me to get permission first. They meant from the executive branch of Nakhichevan, Mr. Mamishov."""" Burat Muriev, an applicant in the Hurdivan region, TEC #46, turned in his signature sheets in early September before leaving for a business trip. When he returned a week later, the TEC told him that they had torn up his sheets under orders from the local government, but that he could re-submit them. Akiv Kerimov, who intended to run in electoral district #61 in the Gabala region, was not so lucky. His TEC simply refused to issue signature sheets. He went to the TEC headquarters for three days in a row, on September 9-11, and finally appealed in writing. The next day Oktai Khajiev, the TEC chairman who had previously served as the deputy regional governor, called him in and entreated him """"Don't get me into trouble, take your candidacy back...Anyway, you will not be able to win."""" During the following four days, Kerimov again attempted to obtain the signature forms from the TEC to no avail. He finally sent an appeal to a court in Baku, which rejected it on the grounds that he had only submitted one copy of his appeal, on the final day of candidate registration, September 30.  Harassment and intimidation Candidates, their campaign personnel, and those voters who gave signatures in support of their candidacies all faced harassment from local government authorities. Akper Akperov, forty-three, a history teacher and Musavat party member, recounted that the local governor stopped him in the street as he gathered signatures in support of Musavat's party list, saying """"I know you are collecting signatures for the opposition and I told you not to do it."""" Additionally, his family was threatened with the loss of their jobs because of his activities. Another Musavat signature collector from the same district, """"Elshan E.,"""" (not the man's true name) told Human Rights Watch that the local governor had harassed him as well in September. Two days after this harassment, a local tax inspector visited his shop, accusing him of not having a license to sell alcohol and cigarettes. The inspector returned the following day, threatening him, """"We can take your shop away, we can destroy it."""" According to Elshan E., no tax inspector had visited his shop in the six months since he had opened it. Azer Hassanov, a potential candidate in the town of Sheki, TEC #43, noted that three days after he had begun to collect signatures, several of those who had signed for him came to tell him they had been visited by the police--and asked to remove their names. Official pressure against his supporters continued after he submitted his signature sheets to the TEC, inducing several more persons to rescind their signatures. Supporters of Chingiz Ganizadeh, a lawyer and former prosecutor, currently the chairman of the nongovernmental Committee for Democracy and Human Rights and a would-be candidate in the Agdash region, gathered signatures in the village of Liaki. After these signatures were submitted to TEC #49, workers from the Agdash youth department visited these villagers to """"check"""" their signatures, accompanied by the local deputy mayor. Ganizadeh told Human Rights Watch that the TEC informed him that several of the villagers retracted their signatures.  Arbitrary Revocation of Candidacy In the case of Chingiz Rahimov, described above, on September 28 the TEC initially registered his candidacy. After an item appeared in the official provincial government newspaper on October 4 announcing the decision, the provincial prosecutor's office appealed to the TEC to repeat the signature check, although article 7.2 clearly forbids government bodies from interfering with the work of election commissions. The provincial executive demanded an emergency meeting of the TEC, which was attended by the deputy governor. On October 6 Rahimov received word from the TEC--one of the members of which is the provincial tax inspector, who reports directly to the governor--that his candidacy had been rejected. Members of the commission told Rahimov that they were pressured to confirm his disqualification.  Disqualification of signatures Most often, TECs reject candidates' applications after disqualifying the signatures submitted on their behalf. """"Checks"""" of the signatures' validity are conducted by special working groups formed by the TECs, which may include local police """"experts"""" and civil registry workers. These reviews may invalidate the signatures on various grounds, including duplication, incorrect or incomplete passport information, purported falsification, or even stray pen marks. One of the most frequently lodged complaints is that TECs do not accept the new Azerbaijani national passport (issued to replace the Soviet passports) as proof of identity for the purposes of signature-gathering. Instead, citizens must show a state identity document, form I-9, which some have received in lieu of new passports. Article 41.4 of the elections law is notably silent on which identity documents that may serve the purpose of signature gathering. According to a written complaint, TEC #11 of Baku's Khatai district rejected the application of naval Captain Dzhan-Mirza Ismail ogly Mirzoev, ruling that the members of the military who gave their signatures in support of his candidacy supposedly have no right to do so because their military papers are not valid identity documents (although this is not stipulated in the law on elections). TEC #49 rejected Chingiz Ganizadeh's candidacy, finding 469 of the 2,249 signatures submitted on his behalf to be invalid on several grounds: stray marks, missing data, and alleged duplication. TECs undertake the process of signature checking with extreme partiality. Although article 43.4 of the Law on Elections to the Parliament allows candidates' representatives to observe the process of signature-checking, in most cases reviewed by Human Rights Watch, TECs either ignored this provision, or disregarded those representatives' objections to unfair practices. TEC #9 rejected the candidacy of independent Azer Hasret, chairman of the Independent Journalists Union, invalidating ninety-six of 2,091 signatures; he was disqualified by nine signatures. In Kuba region, registered candidate Gulaga Agaev told Human Rights Watch that he asked to see the signature sheets of his rival, Vagif Arzumanli, rector of Baku's Institute of International Affairs, suspecting some fraud. The local TEC refused to show him the sheets. Agaev alleges that representatives of the local government actually gathered signatures on behalf of Arzumanli, in violation of the elections law. Two members of electoral commission #64, signed a statement protesting the alleged falsification but no action has been taken. Shahid Ibragimov, secretary of TEC #49, even when confronted article 43.4 , refused to allow Gunduz Ganizade, the brother and campaign representative of Chingiz Ganizade, to accompany signature checkers on their house-to-house rounds.  Appeals to the Central Electoral Commission and to the Courts According to the Law on Parliamentary Elections as it was adopted in July, the CEC must review disputed registration cases before applicants may file suit in a court. In practice, this procedure adds to the potential for delays and obstruction, lessening the already meager chances that an unsuccessful applicant might ultimately gain registration. In the case of Burat Muriev, more than two weeks after his initial appeal to the Central Electoral Commission that body had still not begun to consider his complaint. Once the Central Electoral Commission has rejected a candidate's claims, or refused to review them, it usually instructs candidates to appeal to their local district court, or in some cases to apply directly to the court of appeals. In the courts, candidates have not generally obtained satisfactory redress. Would-be candidate Dilshod Guseinova tried for several days during the third week of October to lodge her complaint with the court of appeals in Baku, before giving up hope. She found either that the court was closed, or that the court secretaries would not accept her documents. As with the TECs, it is alleged that local government pressure has caused judges to uphold the denial of registration in nearly all cases. In one court proceeding observed by Human Rights Watch on October 23, Agdash District Court judge Ishallah Guliev approved the finding of TEC #49, invalidating several sheets of signatures in support of candidate Chingiz Ganizade because they were gathered by the director of a local small enterprise. The TEC had maintained that this person, as director, was in fact a legal entity (not a physical person), and therefore according to the Law on Elections was prohibited from gathering signatures; yet during the hearing, TEC secretary Shahid Ibragimov withdrew this claim. Courts may also delay issuing copies of their decisions, which prevents candidates from filing timely appeals, and reduces the chances that they may ultimately be registered in time to appear on the ballot. In the case of Chingiz Ganizadeh, the district court rendered its decision on the October 23, but has refused either to give the candidate's representatives a copy of the decision, or to transmit it to the court of appeals in Baku (three hours journey by car) any sooner than ten days after the decision, leaving only four days before the election.  Harassment of the Media Freedom of expression and equal access to the media are key elements of the conduct of free and fair elections. Both principles are enshrined in paragraph 7, section (8) of the Copenhagen document. Despite the formal abolition of censorship immediately preceding the 1998 presidential elections, in accordance with OSCE recommendations, Human Rights Watch remains concerned that instances of harassment of the media during the current election campaign serve to inhibit critical reporting and inspire self-censorship. The August 22 detention of Rauf Arifoglu, the editor-in-chief of Yeni Musavat (New Musavat), in connection with a failed August 18 hijacking attempt by a Musavat party member, which the paper reported, boded poorly for media freedom. Arifoglu, who was later named to the Musavat party list, was held for forty-five days in solitary confinement and was initially interrogated without a lawyer present. Authorities released him on October 5, but trumped-up charges remain, including of illegal firearms possession, terrorism, and """"calling for a coup d'etat,"""" which carry a maximum life sentence. Tax audits, and libel suits and other criminal charges have been deployed against critical print media in the six months preceding the elections. Immediately following the publication of an article critical of the president, tax officials raided the Baku-based Monitor Weekly, on May 9. The paper's editor, Elmar Husseinov recounted that although the tax police filed suit against the paper, he was never notified of the hearing and learned only in September that the paper's license was revoked, which prevented him from filing a timely appeal. The court order, issued July 17, instructed the Ministry of Information to prevent Husseinov from registering another media outlet. Other Baku-based papers Uch Nokta and Avropa continue to appeal highly questionable libel awards and fines in court.The editor-in-chief and founder of Uch Nokta, Khoshgadam Bakhshaliyeva, claimed that these pending cases serve to inhibit editors who might consider criticizing the government in the run-up to the elections. Electronic media are also vulnerable to government pressure, as the October 1999 closure of independent station Sarah-TV attests. On October 3 of this year, authorities suddenly shut down Azerbaijan Broadcasting Agency (ABA), an independent station that does not broadcast political material, for ten days. The closure came immediately after two opposition parties interested in purchasing air time had approached the station. The station's president, Faiq Zulfugarov, told Human Rights Watch that he believes that the closure was a warning from the government not to get involved in politics. At the same time, the tax inspectorate began an audit of the station. Tax inspectors present during Human Rights Watch's interview on October 18 would not indicate when their inspection would be finished. Conclusions   The OSCE/ODIHR Needs Assessment Mission to the Azerbaijan Parliamentary Elections report of September 11 stated that despite significant shortcomings, """"the current conditions can provide for competitive elections...In particular, a transparent and inclusive completion of the political party and candidates' registration procedures is essential for a competitive elections process."""" The registration procedures, however, are anything but """"transparent and inclusive,"""" and effectively prevent the citizens of Azerbaijan from exercising their right to choose their representatives and be elected to office, before even a single vote has been cast. Although on October 10, ODIHR Director Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann called for the government to register all candidates """"unduly denied registration, """" and it has been reported that President Aliev planned to ask the Central Electoral Commission to register all candidates who applied to contest the one hundred single-mandate seats, no such action has been forthcoming. Given the experience in Azerbaijan and other countries in the region, Human Rights Watch urges OSCE/ODIHR to develop a policy that would enable it to, if necessary, reassess its election monitoring strategy as election day nears. In cases in which nonpartisan domestic election observers are prevented from undertaking their duties on election day, and in which the candidate registration process is systematically arbitrary or subject to overwhelming government influence, the OSCE/ODIHR should, in consultation with local NGOs, reconsider the deployment of short-term monitors. The incidents recounted above also clearly demonstrate that the government of Azerbaijan is not engaged in a good-faith effort to fully implement the democratic reforms it promised to enact at the time of the Council of Europe accession vote. Azerbaijan's significant backtracking since the June 28 vote clearly contradict the Council of Europe rapporteur's conclusion that any previous reform is """"irreversible,"""" and that """"the country [will] progress more rapidly along the path of reform if it were a full member of our Organization."""" On the contrary, the international community should confront the likelihood that moving ahead with Azeri membership in the wake of yet another clearly undemocratic election will only entrench the very practices that Council of Europe membership was intended to uproot.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan","Free Speech, Press Freedom"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/29/letter-ins-commissioner-doris-meissner","Letter to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner","Letter to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner","","10/29/2000","Dear Commissioner Meissner: As part of our continuing efforts to monitor the treatment of detainees in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), we are now writing to you regarding our recent visits to the San Pedro Service Processing Center and the INS Staging Area at the Federal Building in Downtown Los Angeles. As you know, Human Rights Watch has issued reports regarding the treatment of adult and juvenile INS detainees.  In June 1999, we visited the San Pedro Service Processing Center (SPC), and in August 1999 and June 2000, we visited the INS Staging Area. We would like to express our appreciation for the access provided by the INS to our investigators who toured the San Pedro and downtown centers. INS officials were available for interviews, allowed tours of both facilities, and permitted interviews with many detainees, as well as some of their visitors. We hope to have an opportunity to work with officials at these facilities to improve upon areas of concern described below.  Our visits to San Pedro and the downtown Staging Area were the first ones Human Rights Watch has conducted since the creation of detention standards for SPCs and contract facilities. We were interested in learning more about the new standards' effect on treatment and conditions, and in identifying areas not covered by the new standards that require attention. For example, one of the most pressing problems-severe overcrowding-is not addressed by the new standards, and requires immediate attention. We were also interested in learning more about the effects of the settlement stemming from Central American Refugee Center, et al., v. Attorney General Janet Reno; INS, which addressed issues such as group legal presentations, access to legal materials, visitation policy, and telephone access.  Current situation at San Pedro SPC We are very concerned about information we have received from San Pedro detainees during the past two months. It is our understanding that detainees engaged in a one-day hunger """"protest"""" on August 16 to protest, among other things, the lack of air-conditioning during much of the summer. Detainees claim that some of those protesting conditions were placed in administrative segregation as punishment for complaining about conditions.  Industrial-strength fans were later installed in the pods, with some detainees now complaining that the noise is deafening - but most preferring the noise to the excessive heat. When we questioned Leonard Kovensky, the Assistant District Director for Detention and Deportation, he confirmed that the air conditioning had not been functioning at San Pedro, and was noncommittal when asked when it would be working again.  Detainees have reported that overcrowding remains a problem at San Pedro. Male and female detainees have told Human Rights Watch that detainees are still sleeping on plastic cots, known as """"boats"""" on the floor. These recent reports do not concur with the information provided by INS officials during our June visit to the Staging Area.  When we contacted Assistant Director Kovensky about the reports we were receiving from detainees, he said that he had received no complaints or petitions from detainees at the time of the August 16 protest, and that officials at the center he had contacted had received no such complaints. Yet detainees reportedly gave their petitions and complaints on the day of the protest to guards to pass on. Either those complaints were not forwarded to the relevant officials, or INS officials were denying knowledge of detainees' complaints.  Findings based on visits-San Pedro SPC  Overcrowding At the time of our visit in June 1999, approximately 550-600 detainees were held at the San Pedro SPC. The facility's maximum capacity is 450. As a result, detainees were forced to sleep on the floor or in """"boats,"""" placed on the floor. Detainees slept on the floor in the dormitory units, but also in other areas of the center, including the windowless processing area and in the segregation unit.  According to information provided by INS officials during our June 2000 visit to the downtown Staging Area, the number of detainees at San Pedro had decreased to 447 on the day of our inquiry. But, as noted above, detainees continue to complain that overcrowding remains a problem and that some are still forced to sleep on the floor. Furthermore, 100 percent capacity is not a sufficient goal, since that requires no area to be uninhabitable at any time, for repairs, storage, or other reasons.  Protecting detainees' lives Our visit to San Pedro in June 1999 followed the April 24 apparent suicide by a Laotian detainee, reportedly named Thanom Posavtoy. We were not investigating this particular incident, but after touring the facility we do have questions about what was alleged to have taken place. The shower area where Posavtoy allegedly hanged himself is exposed to many detainees and, presumably, to guards. How is it that this took place without the pod's guards seeing it taking place? The detainee had been in protective """"suicide watch"""" just before he allegedly hanged himself. It would seem that he should have been closely monitored and not given the opportunity to hurt himself. And if there was foul play, as has been suggested by detainees and others, how did this go unnoticed by guards? Detainees claimed that Posavtoy's body had been cut or slashed, but it was not clear whether this was self?mutilation or the result of an attack.  Detainees also raised questions about the death of a man who was run over by a transport bus at San Pedro in May 1999. Some have alleged that it was not an accident, but that the detainee grew frustrated with untreated medical problems and his transfer daily to the downtown facility and may have been desperate enough to try to escape, hurt himself, or commit suicide.  We have been unable this far to learn basic details or investigative findings regarding these deaths. We have been asked to submit Freedom of Information Act requests with the FBI and INS to learn the outcome of related investigations. We shall pursue these cases until we learn more about the official determinations regarding these deaths.  INS officials claimed that detainees who arrive and appear to have serious mental health problems are sent to Del Amo Hospital. We would like to know how many such detainees have been sent to the hospital during the past two years, either as they arrived or as their mental health deteriorated in detention? We raise this question because several detainees told us that the treatment and conditions in detention made them, and others, become seriously depressed.  Fear of retaliation/reprisals The INS's detention standards prohibit retaliation or any reprisals against detainees who seek judicial relief. Given detainees' accounts, this standard should be expanded to include retaliation for any detainee's efforts to make a complaint or share information with human rights groups or others. Detainees at San Pedro believe that, if INS officials learn that they have discussed conditions at San Pedro with an outside party, their cases or treatment will be affected negatively as retaliation.  One detainee requested that we not use his name or nationality in this letter because he believed that his friend's immigration case was sabotaged when he spoke up about the conditions. A detainee from whom we have received several letters asked that we not write """"Human Rights Watch"""" on the correspondence that we send him for fear of becoming a """"target."""" He writes, """"Things can get nasty if they don't like me giving you the [information] on this place."""" Another detainee told Human Rights Watch that detainees especially fear that they will become """"lost in the system,"""" if the INS decides to retaliate. Through repeated transfers, they will lose their legal representatives and family contacts. One detainee told Human Rights Watch that in August 2000, a San Pedro guard warned her not to file a complaint because a captain who works at the center could make complaining detainees """"disappear.""""  In addition to the retaliatory actions taken against protesters in August 2000, another detainee said that he made a complaint to a supervisor that led to a reprimand of the involved guards. His belongings were then searched and scattered around his pod in what he believes was retaliation for complaining. Other detainees said that guards threaten them with transfer to less desirable pods if they speak out.  It is imperative that detainees know that they do not have to fear speaking out about what they consider unfair treatment or poor conditions. Any INS officials, or those working for the INS, who engage in retaliatory actions should be disciplined.  Medical/dental care INS officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated that it takes no more than three days to see a doctor, but detainees claim it can take weeks. One said it took fourteen days and five sick call request slips. Another detainee reported that another detainee had a painful infection and that he was not treated for a week. Waits for dental care are similar, with a nurse at the facility acknowledging that detainees had to wait for a long time before seeing a dentist, in part, the nurse said, because authorization comes from an INS office in Florida. Detainees claim that the medical staff have been rude and unresponsive to specific needs. No matter the ailment, detainees report that they are provided with Tylenol or Ibuprofen. One doctor reportedly asks how soon a detainee is to be deported before treating ailments, and if the date is imminent, no treatment is provided. Others claim that some with obvious psychological disorders are ignored, or just heavily-sedated and that they """"walk around like zombies.""""  Guards also fail to respond to medical needs, or respond inappropriately. One detainee had allergies to cleaning fluid fumes, and an INS doctor warned that she should not be near cleaning fluid fumes. Nevertheless, guards refused to move her away from the cleaning fumes in February 1999, and because she is asthmatic she had an attack and then was taken to the hospital for several days. A month later she was correctly removed from the cleaning area, but was placed in a stuffy cell and had trouble breathing. She states that the guards ignored her, but then became angry and pulled her out of the cell and pushed her head into a wall while handcuffing her. Her breathing became more labored and was rushed to a hospital by ambulance. Another detainee with a back problem requested a mattress, and was reportedly noted as uncooperative"""" in his file.  Detainees at San Pedro also stated that they were forced to take recreation time, even if they were ill. According to INS standards, recreation time is voluntary.  Due to overcrowding at the time of our June 1999 visit, it appeared that the infirmary could not hold all of the sick detainees. Some of the sick detainees were housed in the processing area and may have been in contact with healthy detainees, in violation of INS detention standards regarding isolation for those with possibly contagious diseases.  Recreation The general recreation area is adequate, but detainees are only allowed to go out of doors for one hour, five days a week. The INS detention standards call for recreation daily. Furthermore, an hour is unnecessarily limited given the lack of programs or other activities, and the overcrowding indoors. Recreation should be voluntary. Those in administrative segregation have a very small, inferior recreation space.  Administrative and Disciplinary Segregation at San Pedro According to the INS, detainees held in administrative segregation, for protective custody, gang?separation, or medical reasons, are entitled to the same rights and privileges as the rest of the population. But detainees state that they only get an hour of television daily, not all day as in the rest of the facility. They state that they are handcuffed for showers, have limited phone access, and that their recreation area is inferior. Women in segregation report that they must disrobe in view of male guards. Detainees claim that they can be sent to disciplinary segregation for any reason and feel that guards enforce the rules arbitrarily.  Privacy Detainees stated that guards search their belongings while the detainees are outdoors during the recreation period. They stated that the reasons for the searches were not clear, and that the guards often left their belongings strewn about. They also stated that guards read personal letters and legal materials. Items have been lost or damaged as a result. Since detainees are frequently pat?searched and searched after visits and, except for Room and Board detainees (who are strip?searched upon return from the downtown facility), never leave the facility, such searches are difficult to understand.  We have also received reports that strip searches are conducted in a humiliating manner. Detainees who do not understand instructions have been ridiculed and, in one case, one detainee who spoke only Spanish was pulled from the group of detainees, ridiculed, and searched while the others watched. Strip searches are never pleasant for detainees or guards, but there is no need to exacerbate the situation by additional humiliation of those being searched.  Hygiene Bedding is not cleaned weekly, as the INS standards require. Detainees state that they do not have a change of clothing when they wash their clothes, and are left with nothing to wear while doing laundry.  Visits Detainees are supposed to be allowed visits with family and friends that last for thirty minutes at least, but at San Pedro SPC they are allowed just fifteen minutes. The INS justifies the short visits by noting the overcrowding at the facility, which results in too many visitors coming to the facility to allow thirty minutes for each. But, in fact, it is not individual detainees' fault that the facility is overcrowded and they, and their families, should not have to suffer because of the shortage of detention space. Visiting hours should be expanded and the visits should be better organized. Several detainees and their visitors told us that the guards were very slow in admitting people and that if there were more efficiency, more visitors would be allowed in. We observed the visiting process and agree that it was unnecessarily slow and inefficient. Visitors also said that some guards treated them very rudely. Some families travel long distances to see detainees. Some do not even get in after standing in the rain or other inclement weather for hours and then do not receive preference during the next visiting period.  Law library The legal service list we observed during our June 1999 visit was out of date . Library materials were adequate, but detainees told us that they had been improved just before our visit. Detainees complained that there is limited access to the library due to the high demand. One described how detainees literally run to get on the list each day because access to the library is """"first come, first serve."""" The INS Standards call for the law library to be """"large enough to provide reasonable access to all detainees who request its use."""" Furthermore, it states that """"each detainee who requests to use the law library will be afforded a minimum of five hours of optional law library use per week. Detainees may not be forced to forego their minimal recreation time…in order to use the law library."""" According to detainees at San Pedro, these minimal standards are not being met.  Long term detainees We interviewed several long?term detainees whose country of origin would not receive them and who could not be released. Since our visits, new INS guidelines requiring reviews of long?term detainees' cases for possible parole have been issued. We strongly urge the Los Angeles INS district to review immediately the cases of those held indefinitely at San Pedro.  Findings based on visits to downtown INS Staging Area, Los Angeles  Room and Board Detainees Detainees who are being """"processed"""" and not permanently assigned to any facility, such as San Pedro or to local jails, are known as """"Room and Board"""" detainees. Some Room and Board detainees may never be assigned to a permanent facility if they are quickly deported. Others are shuttled back and forth between the Staging Area downtown and San Pedro or local jails. They spend their days at the Staging Area, and sleep at San Pedro or a local jail.  SPC staff wake these detainees up and transport them downtown during the early morning hours (between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.) Once at the downtown center, detainees sit in a room for the entire day until late in the evening, when they are sent to San Pedro or a jail until early the next morning.  At the time of our June 1999 visit to the San Pedro SPC, detainees reported poor conditions and treatment at the downtown Staging Area. They stated that while at the crowded Staging Area, the detainees were not allowed to go outside in the fresh air at all, had no activities, and did not receive mail or medical attention. They were transported back to the SPC, sometimes as late as midnight, where they usually slept on plastic cots on the floor. Hours later the shuttling would begin again. INS officials claimed that detainees were processed quickly, but detainees told us that processing could take months.  All of the detainees we interviewed who had been shuttled between facilities told us that the """"Room and Board"""" procedures were exhausting and disrupting. They were often forced to sleep in """"boats"""" in the day areas of the living pods at San Pedro where the television remained on all night. They noted that the sanitary conditions at the Staging Area were abysmal, with one describing the downtown center as """"hell."""" Detainees told Human Rights Watch that, if there was insufficient space at the San Pedro SPC, they slept at the downtown center on the floor with, at most, a sheet to keep them warm. One detainee reportedly contracted pneumonia due to these conditions.  Detainees reported that the downtown center would become severely overcrowded, with some detainees claiming they were forced to stand while detained there. Detainees also stated that the toilets would clog and overflow, leaving them to track human waste on their shoes around the room. Detainees were then forced to sit or sleep on the same floor for sixteen or more hours. One detainee described the smell as """"terrible.""""  When we visited the Staging Area in August 1999, it appeared that some improvements had taken place. The facility was not as crowded as described by detainees in June, and it was more hygienic than was described. Still, detainees there stated that warm meals were not being served, water was not made available and drinking fountains were not working.  When we visited the downtown Staging Area again in June 2000, the number of detainees at the Staging Area reportedly had decreased, thus alleviating the crowding problem described by detainees. Officials provided numbers of detainees held on a typical day ranging from thirty-seven to 135, with one estimating that the average would be sixty. One INS official stated that up to sixty detainees could be held in one tank, but it appeared that approach would lead to serious overcrowding and allow only standing in a tank.  Unfortunately, we requested interviews at the Staging Area with detainees who had been in the """"Room and Board"""" arrangement for the longest time, but the detainees provided by the INS had only been there for a few hours. It was impossible to learn much from these newcomers about the conditions and their treatment in the facility.  The physical condition of the Staging Area seemed improved. The tanks seemed clean and detainees did not complain about unsanitary conditions. We were also pleased that there were two holding tanks for female detainees, allowing the separation of """"criminal"""" and """"non-criminal"""" detainees. We were pleased to learn that warm meals were now being served at the Staging Area.  During our recent visit we noted that the holding tanks were very chilly and that, in June, detainees covered themselves with blankets. It was unclear why the temperature could not be regulated to provide a more comfortable temperature for those spending most of their days sitting in the tanks.  Furthermore, detainees are not allowed to spend time outdoors while held at the Staging Area. No activities are provided, so they are forced to spend their time sitting or standing in a windowless holding area. Regardless of the temporary nature of the detainees' stay at the Staging Area, they should be allowed to go outside for fresh air. The current restrictions highlight the shortcomings in the INS's recreation standards, which allow no outdoor recreation time for short-term detainees. Detainees at the Staging Area stated that drinking water was not provided with meals, despite INS officials' assurances that water was being served. Some said they had not been provided with drinking water during their time in detention. The holding tanks did not have functioning drinking fountains, something we noted during our first visit. And while detainees may drink from the sink, no cups were provided unless specifically requested by detainees.  Some detainees were not informed that they were permitted to purchase telephone calling cards. The INS needs to inform all detainees that cards are available.  Legal service providers, consulate, and Office of the Inspector General (OIG) complaint telephone numbers were not posted in each tank, but randomly. Each phone should have a current list of legal service providers, consulate, and OIG telephone numbers. And, while we were pleased that the telephone number for the local OIG office was posted in pod 7, we were dismayed when we dialed the number after our June 2000 visit and found that it was disconnected without a forwarding number.  We were pleased that a nurse inquired about the health of detainees, but believe those inquiries, in front of an entire group of detainees, is misguided. We suggest individualized interviews by the nurse with detainees, even if those take place just outside the holding tanks but out of hearing and visual range of other detainees. Detainees may be inhibited from speaking out about health issues in front of others, so should be interviewed in a more discreet manner.  Some of the detainees we interviewed were confused and agitated because they did not have basic information about their immigration status or why they were being detained. We appreciated the attention provided to two detainees after we reported that they seemed confused about their status and the """"next steps"""" in their cases. Clearly, tours such as ours are atypical, so it should be incumbent upon INS officials to make sure that INS detainees understand the process and how to obtain legal assistance and how to prepare for hearings.  Thank you for your consideration of these important issues. We look forward to your response and to an opportunity to speak with you further about these areas of concern.

In a nine-page backgrounder issued ahead of the November 5 vote, Human Rights Watch described how the government has prevented opposition candidates from contesting the election, and charged that Azerbaijan was backtracking on its commitments to the Council of Europe.  """"Admission to the Council of Europe is supposed to be tied to a demonstrated commitment to human rights and the rule of law,"""" said Rachel Denber, Acting Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The conduct of these elections shows that Azerbaijan still has a long way to go."""" Human Rights Watch researchers in Azerbaijan have documented how local government officials in Azerbaijan intimidate those who gather signatures for opposition candidates' registration and citizens who signed nomination sheets. Officials also use delaying tactics to prevent opposition candidates from completing the registration process in time. Once candidates completed the registration process, election commissions arbitrarily declared their signature lists invalid, blocking access to the ballot for hundreds of independent, opposition, and other candidates who had completed requirements for registration. No independent domestic groups are permitted to monitor the vote. For months prior to the elections, the government attempted to intimidate the opposition-affiliated and independent media through libel suits, threats of closure, detention and other harassment.  Azerbaijan's record of backtracking on its commitments on democratization—particularly those made to the Council of Europe—gained broader meaning in a statement by the head of the Presidential Administration, Ramiz Mehtiev. In October he announced that Azerbaijan does not consider any Council of Europe recommendations on democratization to be legally binding, and that attempts to pressure their adoption should be considered as infringements on the country's sovereignty.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

In a 45-page report, """"A Question of Principle: Arms Trade and Human Rights,"""" Human Rights Watch charged the South African government with selling weapons to countries with serious human rights problems, where an influx of weaponry could significantly worsen ongoing abuses.  In a 45-page report released today, """"A Question of Principle: Arms Trade and Human Rights,"""" Human Rights Watch charged the South African government with selling weapons to countries with serious human rights problems, where an influx of weaponry could significantly worsen ongoing abuses.  Human Rights Watch noted that after 1994, South Africa announced more restrictive policies on arms transfers. But the report charges that those policies are not always being followed. In 1994, a scandal erupted involving the sale by Armscor, the apartheid-era governmental arms export agency, of weapons to Yemen for probable on-shipment to the former Yugoslavia, then under U.N. embargo.  """"South Africa has come a long way in overturning apartheid's awful legacy,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, Executive Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"In the arms trade, the country has committed to some very good human rights principles. But these principles are not consistently applied and are now under real threat.""""  The Human Rights Watch report cited examples of weapons sales since 1994 to governments engaging in repression against their own people or to countries involved in their own or others' civil wars. These sales clearly violated South Africa's own stated policies. Purchasers of South African arms include Algeria, Angola, Colombia, the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), India, Namibia, Pakistan, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  Hiltermann noted that South Africa has a strong record in other areas involving the nexus of military policy and human rights. The South African government has taken firm position on banning antipersonnel landmines, and has been one of the world's leaders in implementing the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. It has taken important steps to curb the proliferation and misuse of small arms and light weapons in southern Africa, and passed a law on mercenaries in 1998, which prohibited South African citizens from participating in either internal or international armed conflicts. But Hiltermann urged that the South African government do more to institutionalize the important policy reforms on arms sales made since the first democratic elections in 1994. """"First and foremost, South Africa should formalize in law the arms export policies that the government has declared on paper, which include a code of conduct on arms transfers,"""" said Hiltermann. He also urged a more significant role for parliament and civil society in arms trade decisions.  Human Rights Watch called on South Africa to: · establish a legal framework for its arms export policy; · enhance the capacity of government officials to assess the human rights implications of arms transfers; · increase the participation of parliament and civil society in arms trade decisions; · make a greater commitment to full transparency in arms exports.

Millions of workers are excluded from labor laws meant to protect workers' organizing and bargaining rights, and their number is growing. Violations of workers' freedom of association are a strong but hidden undercurrent in the vast American economy. """"I know the law gives us rights on paper, but where's the reality?"""" asks Ernest Duval, a Florida nursing home worker unlawfully fired for leading a union organizing effort in 1994. Duval finally returned to work in 1999 but was fired again in 2000. His employer had a long memory. When it comes to workers' right to form unions, loophole-ridden laws, paralyzing delays and feeble enforcement have created a culture of impunity in many areas of U.S. labor law and practice. According to statistics from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency created to enforce workers' organizing and bargaining rights, the problem is getting worse. In the 1950s, workers who suffered reprisals for exercising the right to freedom of association numbered in the hundreds each year. In 1969 the number was more than 6,000. By the 1990s more than 20,000 workers each year suffered a reprisal serious enough for the NLRB to issue a """"back-pay"""" or other remedial order. Violations of workers' rights are especially troubling when the United States calls on other countries to respect """"core labor standards,"""" including freedom of association. U.S. officials argue that such standards should be included in rules of the international trade system. But U.S. efforts to have other countries upgrade their labor standards falter when the United States itself fails to protect workers' right to organize. In our new report on workers' freedom of association in the United States under international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch found that one-sided rules for union organizing unfairly favor employers over workers. Farm workers, domestic workers, low-level supervisors and other categories of workers numbering in the millions are expressly denied labor-law protection for organizing and bargaining rights. Immigrant workers especially face widespread threats and discrimination if they seek to form unions. Too often, policy debates over U.S. labor law and practice turn on whether they make it easier or harder for unions to organize workers, and whether that's good or bad for the economy. From this standpoint, workers' organizing efforts are just labor-management disputes over shares of the economic pie. But basic human rights such as freedom of association should not be linked to economic outcomes. The 200-page Human Rights Watch report is based on case studies across a range of industries, occupations and regions of the United States. The report recognizes that U.S. workers generally do not confront gross human rights violations where death squads assassinate union activists or collective bargaining is outlawed. But the absence of systematic government repression does not mean that workers have effective exercise of the right to freedom of association. The case studies in the Human Rights Watch report uncover a distressing pattern of threats, harassment, spying, firings and other reprisals against worker activists and a labor law system that is failing to deter such violations. The Human Rights Watch report should prompt U.S. policymakers to reframe the debate over labor rights and trade, recognizing that workers' rights violations are not peculiar to developing countries. The United States should continue to press for workers' rights in trade and investment--but on a foundation of equality and humility, recognizing that workers in nearly all countries run risks when they try to form unions. If the United States starts walking the walk on workers' rights, it will be in a stronger position to persuade the international community to make labor rights an integral part of the global trade and investment system. _______ **) The writer teaches international labor law at Cornell University and wrote the Human Rights Watch report 'Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States under International Human Rights","United States, Economic Justice","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/26/usa-children-marylands-jails","USA- Children in Marylands Jails","USA: Children in Maryland's Jails","Background to the Department of Justice Investigation","10/26/2000","On October 16, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation of the Baltimore City Detention Center to examine possible violations of the constitutional rights of inmates. The investigation will focus on unsafe living conditions, inadequate medical care (including mental health care), inadequate protection from harm for all inmates, and excessive use of isolation for the juvenile population. The investigation was prompted in part by a November 1999 Human Rights Watch report on conditions for children in Maryland jails. The 169-page report, No Minor Matter: Children in Maryland's Jails examined conditions in the Baltimore City Detention Center, as well as jails in Frederick, Montgomery, Prince George's, and Washington counties. One of the report's recommendations urged the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to investigate conditions of confinement for children detained in Maryland's jails. Summary of Human Rights Watch's Findings at the Baltimore City Detention Center: Over 100 juveniles are in detention in the Baltimore City Detention Center on any given day — representing one-half to two-thirds of all children held in adult jails in the state. The jail is a crumbling, century-old facility, where juveniles are confined to dimly lit, squalid cells crawling with cockroaches and rodents and subject to extreme temperatures. Violence between inmates is rampant and often involves crude """"shanks,"""" made from pieces of metal from air vents or old light fixtures. Some jail guards have condoned and even organized fights between youth, known as """"square dances,"""" which have resulted in serious fights. Youth at the jail are frequently confined to their cells for lengthy """"lockdown"""" periods, and may be subject to disciplinary isolation for ninety days or more for relatively minor infractions. Specific Findings: Living Conditions With portions of its Men's Detention Center dating to 1809, the Baltimore City Detention Center is the oldest pretrial facility in use in the state of Maryland. LaMont Flanagan, commissioner of the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services' Division of Pretrial Detention and Services, referred to the jail as an """"artifact"""" and described the facility as """"your old style jail that you see on television."""" Over 100 youth under the age of eighteen are held in this crumbling facility, which is equipped with woefully inadequate light and ventilation and infested with vermin. The vast majority of detainees are male, with no more than five to ten girls in detention at any one time. The average length of stay for juveniles is 113 days, according to the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services' figures for fiscal year 1999. Many remain in detention for six months or more. Bars along the front of each row of cells open onto a passageway; no cell faces any other cell. Exposed pipes, many with torn insulation, line the passageways. The only natural lighting in the section comes from the four or five large windows in each passageway. At the time of our visit in May 1999, most of these windows were partially blocked by plywood or covered by opaque plexiglass or translucent plastic sheeting. Most of the glass panes were broken where the windows were not covered. Originally designed for single occupancy, most of the cells have two bunks and a combination sink and toilet. The majority of the cells measure about eight by seven feet and have eight-and-a-half-foot ceilings; two cells, the first on each side of the upper tier, are slightly larger. The section has two isolation cells with heavy metal sheets completely covering the bars, blocking all natural light from entering the cells. Violence Weapons are widespread at the Baltimore city jail. Because of the facility's age, detainees are readily able to make """"shanks,"""" or weapons fashioned from pieces of metal from air vents or old light fixtures. One detainee told Human Rights Watch: """"The whole section has knives. People got to keep them for a reason, because they fear for their life. If you feel you're gonna get stabbed up and the CO's not gonna do nothin, you got to take matters into your own hands."""" Although the jail reports that incidents of violence have declined over the past five years, it remains unacceptably high. During our May 1999 visit to the jail, we reviewed all special incident reports involving juveniles that had been filed within the previous nine months. The reports documented a total of thirty-five incidents, including twelve assaults or stabbings. When we asked an official about juvenile-on-juvenile violence in the jail, he said, """"There's something maybe once, twice a week. It's difficult to assess unless they tell us they have an enemy."""" Many juvenile detainees reported that violence and harassment was a regular occurrence. Joey, seventeen, described the degrading harassment he endured from the adult inmates in the segregation section of the Baltimore detention center: """"Every day, the other inmates, they would throw stuff at me. You know, like shit and stuff. I complained to the CO's, but they didn't do nothing. I can't count the number of times I asked the CO's to move me. I said, """"Can you move my cell?"""" They said no, but they seen the shit. Every day I'm getting shit thrown on me from the others cells. I didn't want to say nothing out loud directly, because the other guys would just keep doing it. I just kept asking to get moved."""" In desperation, Joey finally resorted to telling the guards he was suicidal so that he would be moved to a special area for those on suicide watch. Human Rights Watch heard several accounts that guards allowed youths to fight with each other in a practice known as the """"square dance."""" Detainees told us that during the """"dance,"""" guards lock all detainees into their cells, except for two boys who fight in a square area on the tier, measuring about eight feet by eight feet. Guards supply those fighting with boxing gloves, and monitor the fight. Jackson reported: """"It ends up with busted heads, slashes over your eyes, broken fingers, cut lips, maybe a broken nose. But you don't go to the hospital for the cuts. If you did, there'd have to be a report, and the guards would have to explain why two guys were out in the square while everybody else was locked in."""" Discipline Juvenile detainees at the Baltimore detention center frequently reported arbitrary and excessive punishment. Our review of disciplinary records in that jail found many instances in which children were given lengthy periods of segregation, often with loss of visits and other privileges, for relatively minor offenses. One youth threatened another for his sweatpants and received ninety days of segregation with loss of privileges. Another received forty-five days after throwing a bar of soap at a guard and telling him to get off the tier. A third received sixty days with loss of privileges after refusing to go into his cell when ordered and reportedly becoming belligerent toward the staff. In many more serious cases, we found that disciplinary hearing officers routinely gave juveniles the maximum sanction possible — ninety days in segregation per charge — and in some cases directed youth to serve their sanctions consecutively. Those sent to segregation are confined to their cells for twenty-three hours a day. Child and adolescent psychiatrists have concluded that such isolation over extended periods is the equivalent of sensory deprivation, and can create extraordinarily severe psychic stress for adolescents. Some youth are placed in administrative detention for the entire period of their pretrial detention, a status known as """"supermax."""" Such placement is often made without a hearing, and can be based solely on a notation that jail staff suspect that the youth posed a safety risk. American Correctional Association (ACA) standards permit the use of disciplinary segregation only after an impartial hearing has determined that alternative dispositions are inadequate and that the inmate's presence in the general population poses a serious threat to security or operations. The ACA standards applicable to juvenile detention facilities call for no more than five days of such confinement. Even for adults, these periods of segregation are excessive. ACA standards applicable to adult jails call for a sixty-day maximum on disciplinary segregation for all violations arising out of one incident, and call for a review by the facility administrator for any confinement exceeding thirty days. Youth at the Baltimore City Jail are also frequently subjected to lockdowns, meaning that they are restricted to their cells with limited or no access to showers, recreation, visitation, or religious services. After an escape or fight, entire sections, and sometimes the whole facility can be locked down for days or even weeks. """"We go on lock a lot,"""" reported Paul. """"Can't come out of your cell, no showers, no phone calls."""" The general population had been on lockdown for much of the six months preceding Human Rights Watch's May 1999 visit. The application of such broad restrictions for lengthy periods of time appears at best to be arbitrary, lacking any valid security rationale; at worst, such practices constitute collective punishment, which is prohibited under international standards. Medical and Mental Health Care The Baltimore City Detention Center has procedures in place to examine detainees upon their admission, and all of the youth we interviewed reported that they were screened by medical staff within several days of their arrival. Nevertheless, youth frequently told us that they had difficulty seeing medical staff when they were sick or needed dental care. """"You got to write a lot of times,"""" said Joey. Marlow, a sixteen-year-old at the city jail, told us, """"I put out a sick call, but not been called yet. That was three weeks ago."""" In general, youth reported that they would have to wait a week or more to see a nurse or doctor if they became sick after receiving their initial medical examination; some youth reported that their requests for medical assistance were ignored altogether. In Maryland and across the United States, detainees have a higher incidence of mental illness than the population as a whole. Accordingly, mental health services are a critical aspect of medical care in jails. In our tour of the Baltimore City Detention Center, where Human Rights Watch's investigative team included a mental health professional, we were disturbed to find serious deficiencies in the mental health program. Mental health services in Baltimore's jail are minimal to nonexistent, with no services especially for juveniles. There are no therapeutic groups, no individual counseling, and no efforts at aftercare planning. In practice, the only detainees who receive mental health services are those in crisis, who are housed in deplorable conditions. Touring the mental health unit, we saw inmates who were naked, with nothing more than paper blankets to cover their bodies; no medical necessity justified this dehumanizing practice. The lack of appropriate mental health care is especially troubling because children in detention are much more likely than youth as a whole to have mental health needs, and the conditions in which they are confined may well exacerbate their preexisting mental disabilities. Even for those youth who do not come to jail with prior mental health needs, being jailed takes an emotional toll. Indeed, research suggests that children in adult jails may be up to eight times more likely to commit suicide than their peers held in juvenile detention centers. Girls in Detention Girls in detention are faced with the prospect of near-total isolation, often left only with each other for company. Human Rights Watch investigators touring Baltimore's jail saw the two girls then in detention standing at the door to their section, their faces pressed to the window and schoolbooks clutched in their arms. When we entered the section, they demanded to know when somebody would come to take them to school, telling us that they had not been to classes for three days. They reported that they rarely had contact with guards apart from meals and the times they were taken to and from school. """"We thought maybe they forgot about us,"""" one said. Girls are usually housed in Dormitory M in the Women's Detention Center. No adults are housed with the juveniles in this dormitory, and detention center officials repeatedly characterized the housing for juveniles as """"sight and sound separation"""" from adults. Nevertheless, women are housed in the next dormitory and could be clearly heard from the girls' dormitory by our researchers. The corrections officer who escorted the Human Rights Watch representatives touring this area conceded, """"Well, the female juveniles really can hear the adults. They just can't see them."""" Even that description was not quite accurate, as girls must walk by three or four adult dormitories, each with floor to ceiling bars along the front, every time they go to or from school, receive visits, take recreation outside their dormitory, or go to the clinic. The officer stated, however, that all adults were locked in their dorms any time a juvenile was in the hallway outside the girls' dormitory. Girls placed in administrative segregation, usually as the result of a disciplinary infraction, are housed in the women's segregation area, although they do not share cells with women detainees. The guard on duty at the section informed us that detainees in segregation are only allowed attorney visits and receive no commissary privileges. Asked how much time each detainee was able to spend outside her cell, the guard replied, """"They're outside enough to take a shower and clean their rooms, maybe fifteen to twenty minutes in total. It's two showers a week."""" Those on """"supermax"""" status—meaning that they spend their entire period of pretrial detention on this section—are allowed outside their cells for a total of one hour each day. The officer told us that supermax detainees may receive visits and make telephone calls. When we pointed out that there was no telephone in the section, our escort explained that inmates could place phone calls through the chaplain's office.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

This is the first time that members of Habré's government have been brought to court in Chad. This is the first time that members of Habré's government have been brought to court in Chad. The groundwork for today's action was set when the former dictator was indicted on torture charges last February in Senegal, where he lives in exile. In July, a Senegalese court quashed the indictment in circumstances which strongly suggested interference by the executive branch. While appealing to the Cour de Cassation, Senegal's highest court, which is expected to rule in the months ahead, the victims are also taking their cases to the courts of Chad, the very site of the atrocities. Among the 17 victims who filed complaints with the N'Djaména District Court against agents of the notorious National Security Service (Direction de la Documentation et de la Sécurité, DDS) were several torture victims. One frequent torture method in the detention centers of the Habré regime was the """"Arbatachar,"""" in which a prisoner's four limbs were tied together behind his back, leading to loss of circulation and paralysis. Aldoumngar Mbaidje Boukar suffered this painful experience in 1989. A former policeman, he was also tortured with electroshocks, immersed and forced to drink excessive quantities of water. Other plaintiffs alleged the arbitrary execution and """"disappearance"""" of family members. Mariam Abderaman's husband Bachar Bong was a top official at the Ministry of Agriculture when he was kidnapped by three agents of the DDS during the 1989 campaign of violent repression against the Zaghawa clan. Today's action was spearheaded by the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), which was created immediately after Habré 's fall and represents 792 victims of Habré's regime. On September 27, 2000, the President of Chad, Idriss Déby, met with leaders of the AVCRP and assured them that he would support their charges, even against former officers of the DDS who still work in Chad's administration today. The President recognized that after a decade of impunity, """"the time for justice has come."""" """"We never accepted - and will never accept - the idea that our torturers are escaping justice,"""" said Ismael Hachim, President of the AVCRP. """"After the arrest of Hissène Habré in Senegal, we realized that we can demand that justice be done here, in our own country. Now, it's time for Chad's judicial system to do its duty.""""

The UN monitors also reminded the government of its obligations under the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, to prosecute alleged torturers who enter its territory. A 1992 Chad truth commission report accused Habré and his government of 40,000 political murders and systematic acts of torture and brutality. Habré, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habré's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1986) Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989).

Peruvian officials have said that parliament must approve the new law before discussing a timetable for new elections. The government proposal writes into the constitution a much-criticized 1995 amnesty, which provides impunity for military, police, and civilian personnel responsible for human rights abuses committed during Peru's fifteen-year counterinsurgency war. It also updates the law to include all human rights crimes committed since June 1995 until the present. Unlike the 1995 law, the present version apparently would include drug-trafficking crimes.   """"This law would be a disaster for human rights in Peru,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch. """"The OAS, and all Latin American leaders, should make it clear that they strongly oppose the amnesty proposal.""""     The OAS has so far failed to oppose the proposal. In a recent statement, OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria said that """"only the political and social sectors of Peru should comment at the moment on the national policy of reconciliation that the Government of Peru is proposing, and on its compatibility or otherwise with democracy and the preservation of the rule of law.""""     By contrast, the 1995 amnesty law was widely condemned by the international community. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and United Nations human rights bodies criticized that law for violating the prohibition against amnesty laws covering crimes against humanity.     The introduction of the amnesty proposal follows the return to Peru of Vladimiro Montesinos, unofficial head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), and a close aide of President Alberto Fujimori. Montesinos fled to Panama after a video was broadcast on television showing him bribing an opposition congressman to defect to the government side.     Having formed and supervised in the early 1990s a death squad responsible for torture and extra-judicial executions, Montesinos would be one of the main beneficiaries of the amnesty. On arriving in Panama he had sought political asylum claiming to be a victim of persecution, but he left without obtaining it.     In a September 28 letter to OAS Secretary-General Gaviria, Human Rights Watch objected to the requests made by him and by many member states to Panama to accede to Montesinos's asylum petition.     """"The Fujimori government cannot bargain for impunity as a condition for democratic reforms,"""" said Vivanco. """"It is time for the OAS to stand shoulder to shoulder with its own human rights commission on matters of principle such as the rules of asylum and accountability.""""","Americas, Peru","International Justice"

The rights group called on European states to file a case against Russia in the European Court of Human Rights, for these and other abuses during the war in Chechnya.  The 99-page report, entitled """"Welcome to Hell,"""" describes how Russian troops have detained thousands of Chechens on suspicion of collaboration with rebel fighters. Many of them were detained arbitrarily, with no evidence of wrongdoing. Guards at detention centers systematically beat Chechen detainees, some of whom have also been raped or subjected to other forms of torture. Most were released only after their families managed to pay large bribes to Russian officials. Russian authorities have launched no credible and transparent effort to investigate these abuses and bring the perpetrators to justice. """"Welcome to hell"""" is how guards at the Chernokozovo detention facility would greet detainees, before forcing them to undergo a hail of blows by baton-wielding guards.  """"These are not just abuses of the past,"""" said Rachel Denber, Acting Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Even today, any Chechen civilian is at risk of arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse at the hands of Russian troops.""""  Chechens who do not have proper identity papers, who share a surname with a Chechen commander, who are thought to have relatives who are fighters, or who simply """"look"""" like fighters, continue to be detained and abused on a daily basis in their communities or at Chechnya's hundreds of checkpoints. Many """"disappear"""" for months as Russian officials keep them in incommunicado detention. Some are eventually released when relatives pay a bribe. Others never come back.  Fear of detention has prevented tens of thousands of internally displaced persons from returning to their homes in Chechnya. It has also confined those who have remained inside Chechnya, particularly young men, to their homes or communities.  The E.U. has sharply criticized Russia's actions in Chechnya. It sponsored a resolution at the United Commission on Human Rights urging Russia to launch a national commission of inquiry that would establish accountability for abuse. Six months after the resolution's adoption, the Russian government has failed to launch a credible investigation into human rights abuse in Chechnya, including torture at detention centers. So far, the E.U. has taken no steps to press Russia to form the commission.  """"The E.U. has given Russia more than enough time to launch a credible investigation into abuses in Chechnya,"""" Denber said. """"If the E.U. wants to retain its credibility on human rights issues, it should act now.""""  The report closely scrutinizes abuse at the Chernokozovo detention facility, which became infamous for torture in early 2000, and then underwent a massive clean-up after an outcry by the media and international community. The report also documents abuse in facilities at Piatigorsk, Stavropol, Urus-Martan, the Mozdok and Khankala military bases, and others.  At several detention centers, baton-wielding guards formed a human gauntlet and forced incoming detainees to run through. At least one man, Aindi Kovtorashvili, died as a result of gauntlet-style beatings.  Human Rights Watch researchers also gathered testimony from several former detainees about rape and sexual assault of both men and women. A number of former detainees also gave detailed accounts of the injuries they sustained to their ribs, liver, kidneys, testicles, and feet from prolonged beatings.  Most former detainees interviewed for the report were released only after their families had paid substantial bribes—ranging from U.S.$75 to $5,000—to their Russian captors or predatory intermediaries. Such bribes were demanded so often that in many cases, detention itself appeared to have been motivated by the promise of financial gain, rather than by the need to identify rebel elements.  In February 2000, delegations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited detention centers in Chechnya. Following its visits, the Committee explicitly requested Russian authorities to investigate allegations of abuse at Chernokozovo and other facilities.  It is unclear, though, whether the Russian government has done so. Human Rights Watch called on the Russian government to provide details regarding any such investigations. Human Rights Watch also called on the Russian government to make public the Committee's reports on its February and April 2000 trips to Chechnya; under Committee rules of confidentiality, only the government under investigation can make reports public.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

In a report issued before the opening of the Kuwaiti National Assembly on October 28, Human Rights Watch also called on Kuwait to amend its Penal Code and Printing and Publications Law to protect freedom of expression. The 38-page report, """"Promises Betrayed: Denial of Rights of Bidun, Women, and Freedom of Expression,"""" details Kuwaiti laws and practices which systematically discriminate against women and stateless Bidun, and laws which criminalize free expression by journalists, academics, and writers. These laws contravene Kuwait's international treaty obligations, including the six human rights treaties that Kuwait has signed since 1968. """"Kuwait's commitments to these treaties are just empty promises,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"They are not worth the paper they are written on,"""" he said.  Human Rights Watch said that Kuwaiti women face severe discrimination in both public and private life. Under Kuwaiti penal law, men who kill female relatives in so-called """"honor crimes"""" serve a maximum three-year sentence and are not prosecuted for murder. Women are banned from voting and standing for election, cannot contract their own marriage or divorce without the agreement of a male guardian or judge, and are barred in practice from many public positions, including serving as judges. The National Assembly voted against women's suffrage in November 1999, and is expected to vote on new legislation, including legislation granting women the right to vote but not stand for election, in the new session.  Human Rights Watch also criticized Kuwait's treatment of its 120,000 Bidun residents, many of whom have lived in Kuwait for decades or generations and who should be eligible for naturalization but have not been granted it. Since the mid-1980s, they have faced widespread and systematic discrimination, including violations of their right to enter and leave Kuwait, to marry and found a family, and to work. Their children's right to education, to be registered immediately after birth, to acquire a nationality are also violated.  In 1999 Kuwait promised social benefits and five-year residency permits to Bidun who renounced their claim to Kuwaiti nationality. After the National Assembly passed legislation in May 2000 making less than a third of the Bidun eligible to apply for naturalization, the Ministry of Interior said it would prosecute and deport Bidun who had not been naturalized or obtained a foreign nationality.  """"Bidun parents are being pressured into relinquishing their legitimate claims to Kuwaiti nationality under government programs that promise them access to education and health care for their children,"""" said Megally. """"But what will happen to them and their children five years from now?,"""" he added.  Human Rights Watch also urged amendments to Kuwait's laws on free expression. The Printing and Publications Law and Penal Code mandates criminal punishments for journalistic expression deemed to insult the Amir of Kuwait, Islam or Islamic morality, and non-journalistic expression perceived to challenge a conservative interpretation of Islamic orthodoxy and morality.","Middle East/North Africa, Kuwait","Women's Rights, Free Speech, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Representatives Meet in Santafé de Bogotá, Human Rights Defenders Remain Under Attack","10/23/2000","European countries must do more to support Colombian human rights groups and civil society, which are increasingly under siege, Human Rights Watch said. European Union representatives are gathering in Colombia's capital, Santafé de Bogotá, to announce aid to Colombia. Human rights and humanitarian aid have been the centerpiece of Europe's policy toward Colombia, a sharp contrast to the overwhelmingly military approach of the United States, Human Rights Watch said. On August 22, 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he would waive important human rights conditions in U.S. aid to Colombia on """"national security"""" grounds, a decision Human Rights Watch strongly criticized. """"The human rights situation in Colombia is deteriorating,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Washington rejected a key opportunity to do what was right. Now Europe must step in to address this human emergency.""""  The Colombian government is failing to take needed steps to break the close ties between the military and paramilitary groups and to support vigorous civilian prosecutions of human rights abusers in uniform, Human Rights Watch said. The result is an increased number of attacks against human rights defenders and others in Colombia.  So far this year, four human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia and three have been forcibly disappeared. Many defenders have had to abandon their work or leave the country to protect their lives. Threats have been particularly serious in Medellín and Barrancabermeja, cities that have long nurtured vibrant human rights alliances. Many threats appear to be the work of paramilitary groups that continue to operate with the apparent tolerance and at times open support of the Colombian Armed Forces.  Civilian groups also face attack from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC), which recently characterized them as """"paid killers [for the Colombian military]."""" In a statement on why guerrillas failed to honor an invitation to an October peace meeting in San José, Costa Rica, sponsored by a broad-based coalition of human rights, peace, and community groups, the FARC dismissed the effort as organized by """"the enemies of Colombia and its people.""""  """"The suggestion that human rights and peace initiatives convert individuals into 'enemies' and legitimate targets in this war is absurd and reprehensible and must be condemned,"""" said Vivanco. """"Unfortunately, treating civilians as enemies is part of a logic embraced by all sides, leading to thousands of avoidable civilian casualties.""""  Government efforts to protect threatened defenders continue to be slow, insufficient, and often irrelevant, Vivanco noted. Even as government offices provide bullet-proof glass to threatened offices and distribute bullet-proof vests, defenders continue to be murdered by experienced killers. Meanwhile, the FARC targets individuals who criticize its violations of international humanitarian law, which include the killing of civilians, hostage-taking, the use of indiscriminate weapons, and the recruitment of children.  Most cases involving the murder of human rights defenders remain either in investigation or with only the material authors of the crimes identified or under arrest. Among these cases are the 1996 killing of Josué Giraldo Cardona; the 1997 killings of Mario Calderón, Elsa Alvarado, and Carlos Alvarado; the 1998 killings of Jesús Valle Jaramillo and Eduardo Umaña Mendoza; and the 1999 killing of Julio González and Everardo de Jesús Puerta. In all cases, the people who planned and paid for the killings remain at large.  This year alone, the following human rights defenders have been killed:  · Demetrio Playonero, a displaced person and human rights leader, was murdered, presumably by paramilitaries, on March 31. After shooting him in the head in front of his wife at his farm outside Yondó, Antioquia, the gunmen breakfasted, then stole the farm's cattle;  · Government prosecutor Margarita María Pulgarín Trujillo, part of a team developing cases linking paramilitaries to the army and regional drug traffickers, was murdered in Medellín on April 3, apparently because of her work. Several of her colleagues had already fled Colombia because of death threats from a gang of hired killers known as """"La Terraza,"""" a close ally of Carlos Castaño.  · On May 3, Jesús Ramiro Zapata, the only remaining member of the Segovia Human Rights Committee, was killed near Segovia, Antioquia;  · On July 11, Elizabeth Cañas -- whose son and brother had been seized by paramilitaries in 1998 and have yet to be found -- was shot and killed in Barrancabermeja. Cañas was a member of the Association of Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared (Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos -Colombia, ASFADDES);  In addition, indigenous activist Jairo Bedoya Hoyos was forcibly disappeared on March 2 and remains unaccounted for. Most recently, Angel Quintero and Claudia Patricia Monsalve, members of ASFADDES, were forcibly disappeared on October 6 and remain missing.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Colombia",""

On October 13, Indonesian authorities sent a task force of government representatives and military and police personnel to West Timor, and the registration effort reportedly began on October 19. Human Rights Watch also urged donors to make funding for resettlement and repatriation contingent on the development of an impartial and fully transparent registration procedure that meets standards of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  """"Everyone wants a quick resolution of the refugee crisis, but unless the refugees can express their wishes without intimidation or pressure, the process will have no credibility,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch urged adoption of the following safeguards: Development of a simple but neutral questionnaire to determine whether refugees seek to return to East Timor or resettle in Indonesia. Given that many refugees still lack reliable information on their options, care should be taken to ensure that the questionnaire is free of loaded questions and is both easy to administer and interpret. Development of the questionnaire should be a fully transparent process, with a draft document reviewed by impartial parties, including international humanitarian agencies, local church and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the U.N.  Public announcement of the proposed methodology that will be followed in interviewing the refugees, including how, when, where, and by whom interviewing will be conducted; whether all adults or only heads of household will be questioned; what safeguards for confidentiality will be in place; and who will supervise the process.  Prohibition on the involvement of political organizations such as UNTAS (""""Union of Timorese Warriors"""") whose agenda could influence the outcome of the survey.  Public provision of full and accurate information to the refugees about what they can expect as a result of their choice. Officials in U.N.-administered East Timor (UNTAET) should prepare a fact sheet explaining what will happen to returning refugees from the moment they cross back: how long they might be expected to stay in transit camps; what assistance they will be given for reintegration; what channels will be available to them if problems arise; and what political rights they will have. The factsheet should also explain how justice and reconciliation procedures will work for those suspected of participation in militia violence. The Indonesian government should prepare a similar sheet about resettlement, including when it would take place, how resettlement sites would be determined, and what economic assistance would be available. The Indonesian government clearly wants to get the registration process completed as quickly as possible, both to ease international pressure to resolve the refugee situation and to remove a source of social unrest in West Timor. International pressure on Jakarta has been intense since three U.N. aid workers were killed by a militia-led mob on September 6, 2000. On November 13, the U.N. Security Council is scheduled to send a delegation to observe Indonesia's progress to date in fulfilling the terms of Resolution 1319, a sharply worded statement issued by the Security Council in September, demanding that Indonesia act immediately to address the refugee crisis. The delegation should look at the registration process as a matter of urgency.  Background In part in response to Security Council pressure, in part to veiled warnings from donors that assistance to Indonesia could be contingent on improvements in West Timor, the Indonesian government has done more with respect to West Timor in the last month than it did during the entire previous year. Nevertheless, there is still concern that its actions to date have been superficial.  It was in this context that the Indonesian government sent a task force to West Timor to work out modalities for registration, resettlement, and repatriation.  In recent weeks, Indonesian military and police have conducted """"sweepings"""" in major camps and have confiscated a few dozen firearms and hundreds of homemade guns. Even militia leaders have acknowledged that they were retaining weapons, however, and there has been no indication of any arrests on weapons charges or any serious effort to investigate the source of a seemingly endless supply of ammunition to militias who have made incursions into east Timor.  The Indonesian government also continues to turn a blind eye to the fact that UNTAS, an organization formed by militia leaders in January 2000, can in no way legitimately claim to speak for all East Timorese refugees and is in effect the political front of the militias. Indonesian officials have repeatedly treated UNTAS as the official representative of East Timorese in West Timor, when in fact its members are believed to represent a minority of the refugee population and have prevented people from exercising their right to return to East Timor.  In response to calls that those responsible for the killings of the U.N. humanitarian workers be brought to justice, the Indonesian government did arrest six individuals, but calls by the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights for an independent fact-finding team went unheeded. All investigations to date have been conducted by a joint Indonesian army and police team whose objectivity is open to question.  In recent days, the possibility has emerged that a breakaway group of four militia leaders might try to return to East Timor with a large number of their followers. The four wrote to the U.N. Security Council on October 14, 2000, reporting """"[a]cts of terror and intimidation, along with efforts to assassinate former Militia commanders who TNI/POLRI [the Indonesian army and police] suspect of knowing secrets concerning various cases of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in East Timor."""" The four militia leaders, who also offered in the letter to reveal full information about the destruction of East Timor in 1999, have been denounced by Indonesian and East Timorese pro-integration officials alike as """"opportunists"""" trying to escape punishment for their crimes.  Human Rights Watch noted that the motives of the breakaway militia group remain unclear and emphasized that if a large group of refugees were to return to East Timor prior to the establishment of a neutral registration process, they should be given a chance in East Timor to express their wishes free of the influence of the militias who bring them back.","Asia, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

""""When people are thrown in jail and organizations shut down for trying to monitor these elections, for instance, there is good cause for concern,"""" he said. In a six-page election backgrounder, Human Rights Watch pointed to several factors which might impact the fairness of the upcoming elections:  · Restrictions on freedom of association and assembly, including the ability to form political parties, to hold public rallies and organize marches as part of an electoral campaign, · Arrests and prosecution before military and state security courts of political opponents and potential opposition candidates, in particular members of the Muslim Brotherhood, · Restrictions on freedom of expression including banning of books and newspapers and the instituting of criminal charges against journalists, and · Harassment of human rights activists and others preparing to monitor the elections.  Human Rights Watch welcomed a July 8 ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court which led to full judicial supervision of the election process. Such supervision was lacking in the 1990 and 1995 parliamentary elections.  However, Human Rights Watch noted concerns raised by senior members of the Egyptian judiciary and professors of constitutional law that the changes may not be sufficient to guarantee fair elections. For example, final say on the selection of members of the judiciary for electoral supervision rests with the Minister of Justice, and some of the judges appointed to head polling stations are government employees attached to the Ministries of Justice or Interior.  """"In order to ensure the complete independence and impartiality of electoral supervision the judges should have been appointed, and not just nominated, by the Supreme Judicial Council,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.

""""Trade and economic cooperation would clearly be easier if European and Asian countries were also working closely together to find ways to effectively combat such violations,"""" Leicht said. """"The Asian economic crisis taught us that agreements to expand trade and investment are not enough to ensure progress. You also need transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.""""  Human Rights Watch called on ASEM III participants to:  take action to curb the trafficking of women into prostitution. Asian women continue to be trafficked to Europe in large numbers. Increasingly, women from eastern Europe are also being trafficked to Asia, with cases reported in Malaysia, Thailand, and China among other countries. Trafficking of women within Asia also demands urgent attention. Japan and Thailand in particular should be urged to take more effective action to end abuses suffered by thousands of Thai women trafficked to Japan each year and subjected to debt bondage, forced prostitution, and exploitation as illegal foreign workers. All ASEM members should agree to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The only ASEM member country that has done so is the Philippines; not a single European country has even signed the convention.  call on the Indonesian government to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1319, adopted on September 8, 2000, calling for """"immediate and effective action"""" to resolve the ongoing crisis in West Timor.

Participants should call for complete disarmament of former militia members in West Timor, punishment of those responsible for the terror in East Timor last year and for criminal acts committed in West Timor, and protection and assistance such that all refugees are able to choose free from coercion whether to return to East Timor or be resettled in Indonesia. Indonesia has taken some measures in recent weeks but must be encouraged to do more, including further legal action against militia leaders responsible for violent attacks. Participants could use the ASEM meeting to work out a plan ensuring full international participation in any process of registering refugees and in funding and monitoring safe return or relocation within Indonesia.  commit to ratifying key International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions guaranteeing freedom of association and banning forced labor, for those countries that have not already done so.  urge China to couple its commitments as a prospective member of the World Trade Organization with clear commitments to uphold international human rights standards. China should promptly ratify the U.N. human rights treaties it has signed, and accept a direct contact mission from the ILO to address government violations of Chinese workers' right of free association.  urge Burma to end its crackdown on pro-democracy advocates, including the de facto house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, and fully comply with the recommendations of the International Labor Organization to cease use of forced labor throughout the country. Participants should urge the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to reverse its decision not to address continuing rights violations in Burma.  call on the World Bank to step up its efforts to assist in fighting corruption by (1) publishing anti-corruption risk assessments as part of its annual report, and (2) by actively defending the free expression rights of journalists, officials, and all individuals who face harassment or arrest in their countries for exposing corruption.  strongly encourage ASEAN member states to enhance controls on weapons transfers by developing binding codes of conduct at the national or regional level, with a view toward eventually negotiating an international code of conduct on arms transfers. Human Rights Watch believes that, among other provisions, all such codes should at a minimum include the prohibition of arms transfers to governments and non-state actors that gravely or systematically violate international human rights or humanitarian law or do not fully participate in the U.N.

In the report, Human Rights Watch also strongly criticized the failure of the Palestinian police to act consistently to prevent armed Palestinians from shooting at Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) from positions where civilians were present and thus endangered by the Israeli response.  Simultaneously with the release of the report, Human Rights Watch called on both Palestinian and Israeli authorities to take urgent steps to stop their own civilians from using lethal force against other civilians - an increasingly serious problem. Human Rights Watch also condemned the brutal October 12 killing by a Palestinian mob of two Israeli soldiers in the custody of the Palestinian police. Human Rights Watch said its week-long investigation of clashes in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and northern Israel showed repeated use by Israeli security forces of lethal force in situations where demonstrators posed no threat of death or serious injury to security forces or others. In situations where Palestinians did fire upon Israeli security forces, the IDF showed a troubling proclivity to resort to indiscriminate lethal force in response. At least 100 Palestinians have been killed and 3,500 injured in clashes with Israeli security forces. Human Rights Watch also expressed concern at the IDF's use of medium caliber munitions, which are meant for penetrating concrete and other hard surface barriers, against unarmed demonstrators in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The military munitions were particularly devastating when they hit civilians.  The organization also condemned the repeated apparent targeting of emergency medical personnel and facilities by the IDF, as well as stoning attacks by Palestinian and Israeli civilians on ambulances.  Under international standards on the use of force by law enforcement officials, firearms may be used only """"in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury."""" Even then, law enforcement officials must """"exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved,"""" and """"minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life."""" """"Civilians should not be dying in this conflict, on either side,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Israelis should use lethal force only when it is strictly unavoidable to protect lives, and both sides need to rein in anyone attacking or endangering civilians."""" Human Rights Watch noted that gunfire by Palestinians was a factor in some of the incidents it had investigated. In cases when Palestinian security forces or armed civilians fire on Israeli soldiers, international law enforcement standards require that Israeli forces direct lethal force specifically at the source of the threat and not deploy it in a manner that endangers unarmed individuals. Similarly, international standards require Palestinian authorities to stop Palestinian gunmen from firing from positions that endanger civilians. """"Both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, share an obligation to protect lives,"""" Megally said. Megally deplored the increasing frequency and severity of attacks on civilians by civilians on both sides, and called on Israelis and Palestinians to oppose such attacks unconditionally. """"Israeli and Palestinian leaders should condemn these acts publicly and without equivocation, and instruct security personnel to stop these attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice,"""" he said.  Megally said the results of Human Rights Watch's investigation showed a compelling need for a credible and independent investigation into serious human rights violations in these clashes. He noted that under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs military occupations, Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem are internationally protected persons, and signatory states have an obligation to respect and ensure respect for rights and guarantees of the Convention. The organization called on the special session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights meeting this week in Geneva to authorize Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to set up an international panel of experts, working closely with the existing U.N. human rights mechanisms, including the special rapporteur on arbitrary and summary executions, to conduct an impartial investigation into human rights violations by all parties to the conflict. """"This body should comprise internationally recognized law enforcement and human rights experts,"""" Megally said. """"To be most credible and effective, its members should be appointed not by governments directly but by the High Commissioner,"""" he said.  Human Rights Watch also stressed that the current crisis in the Middle East highlighted the need for the U.N. to establish a standing body of independent international criminal justice investigators to be available for deployment by the UN at short notice whenever the need arises for independent, impartial investigations of a criminal justice nature. Human Rights Watch urged that the Commission on Human Rights create such a standing emergency-response capacity at this special session. Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms division of Human Rights Watch, and Clarisa Bencomo, researcher with the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch conducted the fact-finding investigation from October 4 through October 11. Senior IDF officials did not accept Human Rights Watch's repeated requests for a meeting to discuss the organizations findings.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/16/indonesia-urged-call-papua-ultimatum","Indonesia Urged To Call Off Papua Ultimatum","Indonesia Urged To Call Off Papua Ultimatum","","10/16/2000","Human Rights Watch today urged Indonesian authorities to call off an ultimatum to independence supporters in Irian Jaya (West Papua) to take down all West Papuan flags by Thursday, October 19.  In the past two years, a broad-based and increasingly well-organized West Papuan independence movement has emerged, holding province-wide congresses and petitioning the Indonesian leadership to hold a popular referendum on independence. The raising of the Papuan flag has been at the center of many of the protests. Papuan civil society leaders say that the flag symbolizes the frustrations of Papuans with decades of discriminatory and often brutal misrule by Jakarta. The ban is a provocation and could well lead to renewed clashes between Indonesian security forces and Papuans,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. """"And more violence can only be expected to strengthen the resolve of independence leaders, feeding a vicious circle."""" In place of the ban on the flag, Human Rights Watch called for renewed dialogue and a principled approach to Papuan independence demands. It emphasized that Papuans in favor of self-determination, and Indonesian officials who think self-determination should not even be on the table, can at least agree on ground rules rooted in respect for basic civil and political rights. Those rules should include distinctions between raising flags on private as opposed to public property, and between peaceful expression of support for independence and violent acts. Tension has been rising since October 12, 2000, when Indonesian cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak announced that the """"Morning Star"""" flag, emblem of the pro-independence movement, would henceforth be banned. On the same day, police chief Daud Sihombing in Jayapura, Irian Jaya's capital city, threatened that all flags would be forcibly removed if not taken down voluntarily by October 19. The deadline falls the day after Indonesia's financial donors are scheduled to complete meetings in Tokyo on a new round of aid commitments to Indonesia. The ban on the flag and ultimatum to Jayapura residents mark a dramatic turnaround from more tolerant policies in effect for the past year, and from Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid's promise that the peaceful expression of pro-independence views would not be punished. Over the past two years, the Indonesian government has responded inconsistently to the Papuan flag issue, sometimes letting the flags fly and sometimes moving in and forcibly taking them down. In a number of cases, forcible removal of the flag has led to bloody clashes, the most recent of which, on October 6 and 7 in the highland town of Wamena, included riots in which more than twenty-five people were killed, most of them non-Papuan migrants killed by a Papuan mob. Human Rights Watch stressed that Papuans are right in claiming that they should be able to express peacefully whatever views they like, but said that this does not necessarily mean that they have a right to use government resources to do so. """"On private propery, there should be no government interference with pro-independence expression, including raising the Morning Star flag,"""" said Saunders. """"But the government has the final say over what happens on government property, including its flagpoles. To date, there has been no clear articulation in Papua of this important distinction."""" The international rights group also called for a clear distinction between expression of controversial views and violent acts: no one should be imprisoned for expressing views the government does not like, but those who engage in violent acts, even if they claim to be acting in furtherance of political goals, should be punished in accordance with internationally recognized standards of criminal justice. This applies to Papuan militia leaders as well as to police and soldiers who use excessive force in dispersing pro-independence rallies or removing flags. Human Rights Watch said that Indonesian authorities should demonstrate their commitment to this principle by bringing to justice security personnel and commanders responsible for atrocities committed against Papuan civilians during the Soeharto era. Background Under Soeharto, who ruled Indonesia for thirty years until forced to resign by popular protests in 1998, Papuan flag-raising ceremonies and other pro-independence manifestations were aggressively suppressed. Demonstrators were forcibly dispersed and assaulted, leading activists were subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, torture was common, and hundreds were killed. Papuan cultural self-expression was also strictly controlled. Indigenous Papuans, who are Melanesians and darker-skinned than the numerically and politically dominant Javanese and than members of most other ethnic groups in Indonesia, were second-class citizens in their own homeland. While Indonesian rule brought unprecedented economic development, it also resulted in an influx of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia and caused resentment among Papuans as the benefits went disproportionately to foreign investors and such immigrants.When Soeharto was forced from power in May 1998, many of these long repressed sentiments could be made public for the first time. The strength of pro-independence sentiment was unmistakable as early as February 1999, when one hundred leading Papuan leaders met with then-President Habibie to initiate what was being hailed as a """"National Dialogue"""" on Papuan concerns. But the leaders presented President Habibie with a single demand: independence. This clearly shocked and displeased the Habibie government, which had encouraged the National Dialogue up to then, and the process was soon suspended. In April 1999, the government reverted to the methods used during the Soeharto era, attempting to round up independence supporters and censor discussion of the subject. The crackdown included bans on expression, assembly, and association, arbitrary arrests, and widespread intimidation of independence supporters. With nationwide demands for democratization still mounting across Indonesia, however, opposition voices could not be easily silenced. The result was an uncertain atmosphere in which, even as the crackdown was underway, Papuan leaders continued to assert their right to advocate Papuan independence. In October 1999, following democratic elections, a new government took office in Indonesia under President Abdurrahman Wahid, and promptly initiated a number of reforms. Openly acknowledging the errors of the past, the new administration moved quickly to allow greater freedom and to permit the open expression of pro-independence views. Peaceful Papuan flag-raisings, which had been broken up under Soeharto and Habibie, were now permitted and were held without police interference in at least a dozen places in Papua on December 1, 1999. The next day, however, there was a violent clash between police and demonstrators at a flag-raising in Timika in which six people were shot by police and dozens were injured. Major clashes between civilians and security forces claimed the lives of three pro-independence youths in Nabire in late February and early March. Three more independence supporters were killed by government forces in Sorong on August 22. Human Rights Watch takes no position on Papuan claims to self-determination, but it supports the right of all individuals, including independence supporters, to express their political views peacefully without fear of arrest or other forms of reprisal. To the extent individuals are arrested and imprisoned for peaceful participation in symbolic flag-raising ceremonies, such treatment constitutes arbitrary arrest and detention in violation of international standards. According to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which visited Indonesia in February 1999, the majority of individuals then facing charges in connection with flag-raising ceremonies in Irian Jaya were being held for peaceful expression of their views and, as such, their detention was arbitrary and in violation of international law. Papua, Indonesia's largest province, comprising more than one-fifth of the country's total land area, was first put under Indonesian control in 1963. It was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 in a still controversial, U.N.-approved process. For many years, the province was categorized as a military combat zone (Daerah Operasi Militer or DOM; literally, Military Operations Area) and under an effective state of martial law, ostensibly because of the threat posed by the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka or OPM), an armed group engaged in a generally low-level guerrilla campaign for independence from Indonesian rule. At the same time, many Papuans sought to express their support for independence through peaceful means, notably the symbolic public raising of the """"Morning Star"""" flag which had first been flown openly when local people sought to free the territory from Dutch colonial rule in 1961.","Asia, Indonesia","Free Speech"

Ogata is visiting Bangkok on October 17 and 18. Most refugees in Thailand are Burmese, and they're at risk of being sent back to Burma where they face persecution and human rights abuse,"""" said Sidney Jones, Human Rights Watch's Asia director. """"Mrs. Ogata's visit offers an ideal opportunity for the Thai government to show that it can and will offer protection to those who need it."""" Human Rights Watch is calling on Thailand to: Abide by its obligations under international law and stop all forcible returns of Burmese refugees to Burma. Sign, ratify, and comply with the 1951 U.N. Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. This international treaty sets forth the standards that the Thai government should use in determining refugee status and protecting refugees on its territory, and Mrs. Ogata's visit would be the perfect time for Thailand to agree to sign. Allow UNHCR a stronger role in monitoring refugee status determination procedures in Thailand to ensure that no refugee is returned to a country where he or she could face persecution. Thailand, traditionally generous toward refugees from the region, took a hard line against Burmese refugees, after two incidents in which armed Burmese held civilians hostage. In October 1999, five Burmese gunmen seized the Burmese Embassy in Bangkok; in January, another group of armed men occupied the Ratchaburi provincial hospital. As a result, Thai authorities decided that all Burmese asylum seekers would be moved to camps along the border, and, among new arrivals, only those fleeing fighting would be allowed to stay in Thailand. All others would be classified as illegal immigrants and would be forcibly repatriated to Burma. Admission boards set up by Thai officials in the provinces would determine who among newly arriving asylum-seekers could stay, but some in the government demanded that all Burmese, refugees or not, be sent home within three years. On June 12, over one hundred refugees, some of whom had never had their cases reviewed by the provincial admission board, were forced back from Don Yang refugee camp to Burma and on August 17 another one hundred persons from Nu Pho camp were returned to Burma. Thailand is currently providing shelter in camps to some 120,000 Burmese refugees.","Asia, Thailand","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/15/egypt-elections-peoples-assembly-begin","Egypt- Elections for Peoples Assembly Begin","Egypt: Elections for People's Assembly Begin","A Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","10/15/2000","Elections for Egypt´s 454-member People's Assembly began on October 18, 2000. Fifteen political parties are contesting 444 parliamentary seats, the remaining ten seats to be filled by presidential appointment. These are the first parliamentary elections in the country´s history to be held under full judicial supervision. According to the Ministry of Interior, 4,116 candidates whose nominations had been approved by the September 25 registration deadline are to contest the elections in 222 constituencies in the country's twenty-six governorates. First-round are scheduled for October 18 to 24 in nine governorates, followed by a second round from October 29 to November 4 in nine other governorates and a final round from November 8 to 14 in the remaining eight governorates. The voting is being staggered over three weeks to allow for judicial supervision of all polling stations. Egyptian human rights groups have raised concerns about the fairness of recent elections in Egypt. In 1995, for example, the Ibn Khaldun Center, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the Center for Human Rights Legal Aid (CHRLA) monitored that year's People's Assembly elections, in which the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) won ninety-seven percent of the seats. Their reports documented numerous irregularities prior to and during the elections, including the harassment, intimidation and often arrest of opposition candidates, the presence of security officials inside the polling stations, strong-arm tactics designed to influence voting, and vote rigging. They also condemned acts of violence during the elections, which resulted in the deaths of over sixty people and injuries to many others. Allegations of vote rigging were subsequently borne out when the Court of Cassation nullified election results for seats in some 200 constituencies as a result of suits brought by opposition candidates. Egyptian human rights activists as well as Human Rights Watch have long urged the Egyptian government to end the state of emergency that has been in force almost continuously since 1967. The law, among other things, allows the authorities to restrict freedom of assembly, was renewed again in May for a further three years. The Egyptian human rights organizations contend that democratic elections under such conditions are not possible. This backgrounder notes the important Supreme Constitutional Court ruling that led to legislation giving the judiciary responsibility for monitoring the elections. Human Rights Watch remains disturbed however by persistent and ongoing patterns of government harassment of political opponents and potential opposition candidates, and unwarranted restrictions on basic rights of free expression and free association. These restrictions and this harassment have created an environment quite at odds with what is necessary for free and fair elections.  Guarantees for a fair process On July 8, in response to a lawsuit filed by an Egyptian lawyer contesting the constitutionality of the earlier 1990 parliamentary elections, Egypt´s Supreme Constitutional Court passed a landmark ruling. The ruling stated that current legislation governing the electoral process was unconstitutional because it failed to provide for full judicial supervision of the elections, contrary to the provisions of Article 88 of Egypt´s Constitution. In both the 1990 and 1995 parliamentary elections, only the principal polling stations were supervised by members of the judiciary, while civil servants supervised auxiliary stations. Following the Constitutional Court ruling, two extraordinary sessions of the People´s Assembly and the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council, the upper house of the parliament) approved three decrees issued by President Husni Mubarak proposing a series of amendments. The principal amendment introduced was to Article 24 of the Law on the Exercise of Political Rights (Law 73 of 1956), which had provided for judicial supervision of principal polling stations only. Many of the allegations of electoral fraud in past elections related to irregularities taking place at the auxiliary rather than the principal polling stations. Five other articles of Law 73 (1956) were also amended, introducing changes to procedures regulating the identification of registered voters and responsibility for the vote-counting process, among other things. Many Egyptians, including opposition political figures and members of the judiciary, welcomed the new legislation in line with the ruling of the Constitutional Court. However, several senior members of the judiciary and constitutional law experts in Egypt have continued to voice concern that the separation of powers between the judicial and executive authorities is not sufficiently explicit, giving rise to unwarranted interference by government officials in the judicial monitoring process and undermining its independence. They have raised particular concern that final decisions concerning the selection of members of the judiciary involved in electoral supervision rests with the Minister of Justice. A number of judges have protested that such decisions should rest with the Supreme Judicial Council and not with a representative of the executive. The Council´s role is presently limited to nominating individuals to the Minister of Justice, who has the final say as to which judge is appointed to each polling station. Judiciary members, appointed to head both principal and auxiliary stations, are government employees attached to the ministries of Justice and Interior, among them staff of the Judicial Inspection Department and the Prosecutor General´s office. This has given rise to fears that such appointees may be unduly influenced or pressured by their ministries. These concerns were exacerbated by the decision to appoint Prosecutor General Maher Abd al-Wahed as head of the General Judicial Committee set up to supervise the elections.  Restrictions on freedom of association The government of Egypt continues to restrict freedom of association, including the right of Egyptians to form political parties. Political parties cannot operate legally in Egypt without a license from the Political Parties Committee of the Shura Council. Since its establishment in 1977, this government-controlled body has approved the licensing of only one new political party, in March of this year. The committee has typically ruled that the programs of fledgling political groups are not sufficiently different from those of existing political parties. One noteworthy aspect of the current elections is the overwhelming number of candidates running as independents. According to official government data, only 876 of the 4,116 registered candidates are official political party candidates. The remaining 3,240 are running on independent platforms, compared with 3,160 in 1995 and 1,800 in 1990. The vast majority of them are members of the ruling NDP, which many Egyptians believe is an indirect way of boosting the party´s dominance in the People´s Assembly. However, these candidates also include individuals who failed to be selected for the NDP official list. The large number of candidates running as independents also reflects the restrictions placed on some opposition groups which have either been banned, or have had their activities frozen or were denied authorization to operate as a political party. In the first category is the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been under ban since 1954. In the past, some of the party´s members participated in parliamentary elections after forging alliances with other political parties and running under their banner. In the current elections, ninety members are running as independent candidates. In addition to having to resort to these means in order to take part in the political process, the Muslim Brotherhood has faced increasing pressure and intimidation from the authorities in an apparent attempt to prevent them from running in the elections. On May 20, the Political Parties Committee froze the activities of the Labour Party, an Islamist opposition group. The move, taken ostensibly because of a leadership dispute within the party, was widely construed as being part of a crackdown ahead of the elections. Despite several appeal rulings in favor of the party, the ban on its publications remains in force. The Political Parties Committee formally requested the dissolution of the Labour Party when, on July 24, it referred the case to the Political Parties Tribunal, an exceptional court authorized under the provisions of the Law on Political Parties (Law 70 of 1977). This followed a decision by prosecution authorities to charge nine Labour Party figures, including Secretary-General Adel Hussain, with having links with the Muslim Brotherhood, receiving unauthorized funding, and “working against national unity.” (See below)  Harassment of political activists In a highly politicized case, the government brought twenty defendants, all of them civilians linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, before the Supreme Military Court for a trial beginning on December 25, 1999. They were charged under articles 30, 86 and 88 of the Penal Code with, inter alia, membership of an illegal organization, recruiting supporters, attempting to control the activities of professional associations, and inciting others to commit such acts. None of these charges involved the use or advocacy of violence. The defendants, mainly lawyers, professionals and university professors, had been arrested in October 1999 and held in preventive detention in Mazra´at Tora Prison. The announcement of the verdicts, due in July, was deferred first to October 3 and then to November 7. Many Egyptians saw their prosecution as an attempt by the authorities to prevent them from running as independent candidates in the current parliamentary elections as well as for the boards of their respective professional associations. Most recently, on October 8, prosecutors ordered the arrest of 46 suspected Brotherhood members and renewed the preventive detention periods of 35 others. In Alexandria, on October 5, security officials arrested several members of the electoral campaigning team of Jihan al-Halafawi, the only female candidate linked to the Muslim Brotherhood running for the elections, albeit on an independent platform. One Labour Party leader, al-Sha´ab Editor-in-Chief Magdi Hussain, is serving a two-year prison term after he and other colleagues were convicted in April for slandering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Yusuf Wali. They were convicted under a restrictive Press Law introduced in 1996, which provides a mandatory prison sentence in libel cases. The law has been used by the authorities to punish journalists critical of government officials, as evidenced by the marked increase in libel cases referred to the courts in recent years. Magdi Hussain had announced his intention to run as a candidate for the parliamentary elections if his appeal was successful. The Court of Cassation turned down his appeal and he remains in detention. The Labour Party, unable to contest the elections pending resolution of its status by the courts, has put forward fifteen candidates running as independents.  Restrictions on the activities of human rights and election monitoring groups Egyptian human rights groups, whose activities in the past have included the monitoring of parliamentary elections, have themselves come under attack and activists preparing to monitor this month´s People´s Assembly elections have been targeted. On June 30, State Security Intelligence (SSI) officials arrested Sa´adeddin Ibrahim, sociology lecturer at the American University of Cairo and director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies. Ibrahim was embarking on a project to monitor the fairness of the election in the greater Cairo area and to continue his voter education program. The SSI raided his home and the Ibn Khaldun Center and confiscated documents, computers and other belongings. The authorities also arrested the center´s chief accountant, Nadia ‘Abd al-Nur, and her assistant, Usama Hammad. All were held under preventive detention under Military Decree No. 4 of 1992, renewable every fifteen days. The prosecution initially accused Ibrahim of receiving foreign funding without the authorities´ permission, forgery of election documents, fraud and the dissemination of false information damaging to Egypt´s interests, but did not clarify the laws under which these or later accusations were made. At least fourteen others were also interrogated in connection with the case, several of whom were detained for weeks. In early July the authorities detained and interrogated staff of the Women Voters´ Support Center, an NGO cooperating with the Ibn Khaldun Center on educational programs for voters, two of whom were held in preventive detention. On August 10 both Ibrahim and ‘Abd al-Nur were released on bail, as were their detained colleagues in the ensuing days. On September 24, in the wake of an announcement by Ibrahim that he intended to proceed with election monitoring despite his arrest, the prosecutor-general formally referred the case to the Supreme State Security Court, naming Ibrahim and twenty-seven other defendants. Both the Ibn Khaldun Center and the Women Voters´ Support Center remain closed. In a press conference held on October 2, Ibrahim announced his intention to freeze his public activities, including election monitoring, pending the outcome of the court case. The trial is set for November 18. The controversial Law on Civil Associations and Institutions (Law 153 of 1999), enacted in May 1999, mandated excessive restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and allowed the government a high degree of interference in their internal affairs. It also criminalized any activities by NGOs deemed by the authorities as political. The law was overturned on June 3 by the Supreme Constitutional Court, which ruled it unconstitutional on procedural grounds since it had not been presented to the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council, the upper house of the parliament). Following the Constitutional Court ruling, the Ministry of Social Affairs announced that the highly restrictive Law 32 of 1964, which the new law was intended to replace, would remain in force. The government has said that it intends to refer Law 153 (1999) to the People´s Assembly again after the elections. Deputy Minister of Justice Fathi Naguib told Human Rights Watch on September 3 that the law would be amended in the light of the Constitutional Court decision, but that no further consultations with NGO representatives regarding its provisions would take place.  Restrictions on freedom of expression The authorities continue to impose significant restrictions on freedom of expression, banning books and newspapers and instituting criminal charges against journalists. The 1996 Press Law punishes controversial but peaceful expression. It provides prison sentences of one or two years, often accompanied by fines, for insulting or defaming a public official. In February 1999, for example, prosecutors questioned editor Abbas al-Tarabili and journalist Muhammad Abdel Alim of the opposition daily al-Wafd on accusations of “publishing false reports and propaganda undermining public interest and threatening national security” for reporting about a strike at the Central Bank. They were subsequently released on bail but faced imprisonment if tried and convicted. In April this year, three staff members of the bi-weekly paper al Sha´ab, were convicted and sentenced for slandering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Yusuf Wali. (See above) Editor-in-chief Magdi Hussain and journalist Salah Badawi received two-year prison sentences, cartoonist Issam Hanafi received a one-year sentence, and a fourth, Adel Hussain, Secretary-general for the Labour Party, was fined. In recent years, both writers and academics have been accused of writing material or expressing views deemed by official or self-appointed censors to be offensive to Islam. In a recent case, the authorities arrested an Egyptian author, Salahuddin Muhsin on March 10, charging him with insulting Islam in several novels. On July 8 the State Security Court for Misdemeanors in Giza handed down a six-month suspended sentence, which renders Muhsin liable to imprisonment for conviction on any similar offence in the future.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","Free Speech"

A group of private Korean citizens, organized as the """"Preparation Committee for the Dalai Lama's Visit,"""" invited the exiled leader of Tibet and Nobel laureate to visit in November. The proposed visit would follow closely a visit by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, who arrives in Seoul in late October for the third biannual Asia-Europe (ASEM) meeting.  However, in September, after the Chinese embassy in Seoul reportedly expressed strong displeasure with the proposed visit, a representative of the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Preparation Committee members, insisting that they postpone their invitation to the Tibetan leader until 2001. In March, a Buddhist student organization at Seoul National University seeking to meet with the Dalai Lama reportedly was also told by a foreign ministry official that the ministry would not allow the Dalai Lama to come. The letter from Human Rights Watch emphasized Kim Dae-Jung's """"well-deserved reputation"""" for defense of human rights and called on him to ensure that political considerations not take precedence over private citizens' rights. """"[G]overnment interference with the visit would constitute a significant step backward for your administration and for Korea,"""" the letter concluded. Human Rights Watch noted that Japan recently refused to give in to similar Chinese government pressure. Prior to the Dalai Lama's visit to Japan in April, Chinese authorities reportedly threatened that bilateral relations between the two countries would suffer if the visit took place.

""""Key issues range from transferring indicted war crime suspects to the International Criminal Court (ICTY) in the Hague to re-establishing the independence of the judiciary. They are critical to restoring the rule of law to a country that for so many years languished under authoritarianism."""" Monday the E.U. dropped a subtantial part of its sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and especially Serbia. These sanctions were imposed over the past years in response to war crimes and other violations of international human rights and humanitarian law throughout the former Yugoslavia for which the Milosevic regime was held responsible. """"The E.U. is of course keen to see the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reintegrated into European cooperation,"""" said Lotte Leicht, """"But part of such re-integration is that the new federal and Serbian governments in Belgrade-when they are formed-will eventually have to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the Hague. It's an indispensable part of the rule of law package for Europe.""""  According to Rachel Denber, Acting Director of Human Rights Watch´s Europe and Central Asia division, some of the most important human rights issues on the horizon include: the release of political prisoners; reinstating judges, university professors, and others who were fired for political reasons; restoring the independence of the judiciary, and bringing to justice police and security officials responsible for serious abuses during the Milosevic era. Serbian human rights groups estimate that some 850 Kosovo Albanians who were arrested during last year's NATO war are currently serving prison sentences in Serbia. Most sentences resulted from unfair trials lacking evidence against the accused. Today a Serbian court will re-hear the cases of several of these prisoners, including Flora Brovina, chair of the League of Albanian Women in Kosovo. Brovina, a poet and physician, was sentenced in November 1999 by a district court in Nis to twelve years in prison on absurd charges of conspiracy to commit """"hostile activity"""" and terrorism. President Kostunica is opposed to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague and has said he does not intend to hand over former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and other indicted persons. Lotte Leicht said that the E.U. should make clear that non-cooperation with the tribunal is unacceptable, and that cooperation would be a condition for direct loans and credits. """"The E.U. and other institutions should treat Yugoslavia's cooperation with the tribunal on the same terms that it treated Croatia and Bosnia,"""" said Lotte Leicht.

The latest intimidation follows months of escalating violence and deaths in Eastern Congo, and comes on the heels of last week's visit to the region by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.  On October 9, soldiers of the rebel group Congolese Rally for Democracy (R.C.D.) broke up a meeting held by an umbrella group for human rights organizations in Bukavu. The rights groups were discussing follow-up activities to Robinson's recent visit. According to an observer present at the meeting, Congolese and Rwandan soldiers made the members of the human rights groups """"come out of the office one by one..., lie down and beat them publicly in front of a big crowd with sticks and fists."""" The rights activists were then taken to a military camp, known as Camp Saio, and released later that day.  """"The ruling rebel force has shown once more its contempt for human rights, and particularly for those who are trying to protect human rights, including the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Director of Human Rights Watch's Africa Division. """"This is especially galling in light of the U.N. commissioner's visit last week. The R.C.D. must stop terrorizing those who speak out peacefully.""""  Those arrested included Marcelin Musemakweli (CADDHOM), Muzalia Loochi (Justice pour Tous), François Maheshe and Michel Aissi (both Groupe Jérémie), Raphael Wakenge (Heritiers de la Justice), Venantie Bisimwa (RFDP), Mr. Mushagalusha (Cojeski), Baharanyi Bya Dunia (CEDAC), Jules Lwesso (Bucoie), Moïse Cifende (APRODEPED), Dunia Yogolelo (Pandendum), Mr. Kizingu (AED), Judge Emmanuel Shamavu (ACAT/Sud-Kivu). Also arrested were Kiza Kamatando, Moro Tubibu, Nestor Bauma, Joli Yaya..The office of Groupe Jeremie, where the meeting took place, was ravaged. Soldiers took office materials, including a computer, and continue to guard the office at the time of this writing.  On the radio on October 9 and 10, the ruling R.C.D. also accused three human rights organizations working in South Kivu of fomenting unrest. The R.C.D. has targeted Héritiers de la Justice, Groupe Jérémie and Centre d'Etude de Documentation et d'Animation Civique (CEDAC).  Riots and disturbances have shaken Bukavu since Archbishop Kataliko's death on October 3. Although the Archbishop, a prominent critic of the R.C.D., died during a visit to Rome (reportedly of a heart attack), many in Eastern Congo believe that the R.C.D. is responsible for his death. The R.C.D. banished Kataliko from Bukavu in February to his home town, Butembo, in North Kivu because of his critical attitude towards the authorities, and only allowed him to return to Bukavu in mid-September.  The Archbishop's sudden death fueled the prevailing animosity toward the rebels and their supporters, the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army, and the local Congolese Tutsis known as the Banyamulenge. """"We are extremely concerned about the use of ethnically charged language and incidents of attacks by the population on Banyamulenge and Tutsi individuals who are regarded as collaborators of the R.C.D. The authorities must take all possible steps to contain the violence, and react to violence with a minimum use of force,"""" said Takirambudde.  With the news of Kataliko's death on October 4, greiving citizens took to the streets. During an incident at a trading center for precious minerals run by Rwandans, a Rwandan man came out and shot in the crowd, killing a boy and injuring a man. On October 8, when the dead body of the Archbishop arrived in Bukavu, the governor of South Kivu attempted to address the population but was attacked by demonstrators who threw stones at him. His guards fired shots in the air, accidentally injuring one person, but refrained from using direct violence against the demonstrators. The Archbishop's funeral, on October 10, took place without further major incidents.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda","United Nations, Free Speech"

During peak season, she would often work 14 hours a day in 100-degree temperatures. For months on end she suffered frequent nosebleeds and nearly passed out on several occasions. Despite illness from exposure to dangerous pesticides, she kept on working. """"It was very difficult,"""" she told Human Rights Watch. """"I just endured it."""" Between 300,000 and 800,000 children like Damaris are working as hired laborers in commercial U.S. agriculture today. These farm-worker children weed cotton fields, pick lettuce and cantaloupe and climb rickety ladders in cherry and apple orchards. They often work 12 or more hours a day, sometimes beginning at 3 or 4 in the morning. They risk serious illness, including cancer and brain damage, from exposure to pesticides, and suffer high rates of injury from working with sharp tools and heavy machinery. Despite long and grueling days, some child farmers are paid only $2 an hour. Many of them drop out of school, too exhausted to study. Nearly half of them never graduate from high school. Lacking other options, many are relegated to a lifetime of low-wage field labor that perpetuates the cycle of farm-worker poverty through generations. Agriculture is the most dangerous occupation open to minors in the United States. Work-related fatalities among child farm workers are five times higher than for children working in non-agricultural jobs, and an estimated 100,000 children suffer agriculture-related injuries annually in the United States. The long-term effects of pesticide exposure are not yet completely known, but have been linked to cancer, brain tumors, brain damage and birth defects. Child farm workers interviewed by Human Rights Watch for a recent study described working in fields still wet with poison and being exposed to pesticide drift from spraying in nearby fields. One 16-year-old boy told us that he mixed and sprayed pesticides several times a week, but wore no mask or protective clothing because his employer told him he had nothing to worry about. Despite the hazards of agricultural work, current U.S. labor law allows children working in agriculture to work at younger ages and for longer hours than minors in other jobs. Surprisingly, the 14-hour days worked by a 13-year-old are not prohibited by law. Children as young as 12 can legally work unlimited hours in agriculture. In contrast, kids cannot work in the fast-food industry before age 14 and are limited to no more than three hours of work on a school day until age 16. This legal double standard amounts to de facto race-based discrimination, since the vast majority of farm-worker children are Latino and other racial minorities. This shameful tolerance for abusive child labor in American fields stands in stark contrast to U.S. leadership in combating child labor overseas. The U.S. devotes $30 million a year to international programs to end abusive child labor--a tenfold increase from just two years ago. Last year, the U.S. became one of the first countries to ratify a new international convention to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, including such practices as child slavery, debt bondage, sexual exploitation and forced labor. Congress recently acted to deny trade preferences to countries that fail to meet their legal obligations to end such abusive child labor. This commitment to abolish inappropriate child labor abroad must be matched by a commitment to protect children from abusive labor here in the United States. Labor laws that exempt agriculture from basic child labor restrictions date back to 1938, a time when nearly a quarter of Americans still lived on farms, and Congress was understandably reluctant to regulate the ability of children to work their parents' land. The reality today is vastly different. The overwhelming number of child farm workers are not working their families' farms, but are hired laborers in large-scale commercial agriculture. Earlier this month, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)--backed by the Clinton administration and a national coalition of more than 50 child labor organizations--introduced legislation to update child labor laws, to bring protections for child farm workers into line with those for other working children. He also proposes to toughen civil and criminal penalties for willful child labor violations. Child labor in U.S. agriculture is America's shameful secret. Our laudable efforts to protect children from exploitative labor overseas appear deeply hypocritical unless matched by efforts such as Harkin's to protect children here at home.","United States","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Eshkevari, who has been held in solitary confinement and denied legal counsel since August 5, was tried behind closed doors on October 7 on a variety of charges, including """"being corrupt on earth"""" and apostasy, which carry the death penalty. The verdict and sentence in his case is expected shortly. Hojatoleslam Eshkevari may be facing the death penalty for publicly expressing his independent point of view,"""" said Hanny Megally, the Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"His arrest and prosecution is part of an overall clampdown on free expression in Iran, which has seen the closure of over 25 independent newspapers and the imprisonment of journalists and publishers."""" Hojatoleslam Eshkevari, together with several other leading reformist activists, attended an international conference on the future of Iran in Berlin, Germany in April, where he made a presentation entitled “Dictatorship and its History.” In response to a question after his remarks he stated that, in his view, the veiling and enforcement of a strict dress code for women had cultural and historical origins in Iran, but was not required by Islam. His remarks were publicly criticized by conservative clerics in Iran, including the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamene’i.  Many of the Iranians who attended the Berlin conference were imprisoned on their return to Iran. Conservative leaders opposed to the reformist policies of President Khatami have criticized those who participated in the conference, characterizing them as enemies of the state and as working in collusion with foreign powers. Many exiled opponents to the Iranian government attended the conference.  Hojatoleslam Eshkevari delayed his return to Iran until August 4, but was arrested at his home the next day and taken to Evin Prison, where he has been held in solitary confinement until last week. During this period, he was not allowed access to legal counsel. On October 7, his family was allowed to visit him and learned of his imminent trial before a Special Court for the Clergy.  “Proceedings in these exceptional courts often fall far short of international standards for fair trial,” said Megally. “In Eshkevari's case, the proceedings were closed, and his own lawyer was not permitted to attend. He was forced to accept a court appointed lawyer.”  Eshkevari was initially charged with five offenses: “endangering the security of the state;"""" “propaganda against the state;” “defamation of public officials in published articles;” “conduct unbecoming of a clergyman;” and “denial of basic religious principles.” At the hearing he was charged with three additional offenses, including “declaring war on God;” “being corrupt on earth” and apostasy. These latter charges carry the death penalty.  Human Rights Watch called for the dropping of all charges against Hojatoleslam Eshkevari, and for his immediate release from detention. His and other scholars' right to free expression and to participate freely in public life in Iran should be respected.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran","Free Speech"

Miroslav Filipovic, a freelance journalist from the Serbian town of Kraljevo, was sentenced in July 2000 to seven years in prison for articles written for the Internet site of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), an organization based in London. The articles alleged that Yugoslav Army servicemen committed war crimes against Kosovo Albanians during the 1999 NATO war and that the army's presence provoked tensions in Sandzak, a region in Serbia inhabited mostly by Muslims. The Supreme Military Court in Belgrade annulled the guilty verdict against Filipovic today on procedural grounds, and sent the case back to the court for a new trial. Meanwhile, Filipovic was released on his own recognizance. It is widely believed that the Yugoslav Army leadership, which met with the new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica on October 5, accepted Mr. Kostunica and that the release of Filipovic reflects the political agenda of the new president.  """"Releasing Filipovic is a good step, but Kostunica can and should do much more,"""" said Rachel Denber, Acting Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Hundreds of Kosovo Albanians are serving unjust sentences in Serbia. Releasing them would show conclusively that the new government is fundamentally different from that of Slobodan Milosevic. It would show a dedication to justice and ethnic tolerance.""""  Serbian human rights groups estimate that 850 Kosovo Albanians who were arrested during last year's NATO war are currently serving prison sentences in Serbia. Most sentences resulted from unfair trials lacking evidence against the accused.  President Kostunica's first opportunity to set a pattern for the release of Kosovo Albanian political prisoners will come on Thursday, when a Serbian court will re-hear the case of Flora Brovina, chair of the League of Albanian Women in Kosovo. Brovina, a poet and physician, was sentenced in November 1999 by a district court in Nis to twelve years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit """"hostile activity"""" and terrorism. The prosecution alleged that Brovina was ferrying supplies to the KLA, and based the case against her solely on a receipt for knitting wool, medicines, and medical supplies, and a photograph showing Dr. Brovina with an Albanian fighter.  On May 17, 2000, the Supreme Court of Serbia struck down Brovina's sentence on procedural grounds and returned the case for a new trial. But it also ruled to keep Brovina in custody pending the re-trial.  Of 850 Kosovo Albanian political prisoners, about 650 had their sentences confirmed by the Serbian Supreme Court or the Yugoslav military courts. Only a presidential pardon now can expedite their release. Article 96 (8) of the Yugoslav constitution vests the president with this power. The remaining 200 Albanian prisoners are awaiting appeals decisions by the supreme courts, as was the case with journalist Miroslav Filipovic.  """"We are aware that the new government in Serbia is only being shaped at this stage, and that it will need some time to address all the cases from the past two years in which individuals were sentenced on political grounds,"""" Denber said. """"But Kostunica should not wait too long.""""  Denber said that Mr. Kostunica's position so far rejecting the transfer of indictees to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague threw into question the adherence of the post-Milosevic leadership to international principles that underpin justice and the rule of law.

In the twenty-page report, """"Reform or Repression? Post-Coup Abuses in Pakistan,"""" Human Rights Watch said the Musharraf government had detained opponents and former officials without charge, removed indepedent judges from the higher courts, banned public rallies and demonstrations, and rendered political parties all but powerless. Musharraf follows a long line of generals in Pakistan who have claimed that a period of military rule is the path to true democracy,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"In fact, he is systematically destroying civil liberties in Pakistan."""" Human Rights Watch called on the Musharraf government to: immediately lift the state of emergency imposed in October 1999; set a clear and reasonable timetable for holding national and provincial elections; revoke the Provisional Constitution Order that suspends the constitution and undermines the independence of the judiciary; amend the November 1999 National Accountability Ordinance, ostensibly designed to punish corrupt officials, because it denies detainees due process of law and invites politically-motivated prosecutions; cease using the army to monitor civilian institutions; hold judicial inquiries into allegations of custodial torture and prosecute those responsible. Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Pakistan to raise human rights concerns, and on Pakistan's donors and trading partners to use every available opportunity to press for implementation of the legal and administrative reforms recommended above.  The new report begins with the immediate aftermath of the coup on October 12, 1999 when Musharraf deposed Nawaz Sharif, and the policy objectives that Musharraf announced for his government. It notes that the Sharif administration had alienated much of the public with heavy handed and increasingly authoritarian policies, and that Musharraf took pains to portray the coup as necessary to reestablish a basis for democratic rule. In two areas, Musharraf did take important steps to safeguard human rights. One of these was to promulgate a juvenile justice ordinance protecting children's rights, and the second was to establish a National Commission on the Status of Women. In other areas, Human Rights Watch says, the human rights situation has noticeably deteriorated as the military has consolidated power. Political opponents and suspected wrongdoers have been subjected to prolonged detention without charge, custodial ill treatment, and even torture. The report documents a particularly chilling case of detention and torture involving Rana Sanaullah Khan, a member of the suspended Punjab provincial assembly. Khan was arrested under the sedition law for criticizing the military government in November 1999. He was whipped, beaten, held incommunicado and interrogated for a week in police custody before being transferred to Lahore Central Prison. He was eventually released on bail on January 5.  Two senior Sharif administration officials who were detained on the day of the coup, Information Minister Mushahid Hussain and Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, continue to be held without charge.  The report describes other arrests of political party activists and abuses under the National Accountability Ordinance. The Ordinance confers sweeping powers of arrest, investigation, and prosecution in a single institution, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). It permits detainees to be held for up to ninety days without charge, and at trial places the burden of proof on the defendant. Persons convicted under the ordinance are automatically prohibited from holding public office for a period of twenty-one years—a provision that is being used to remove leaders of major political parties from power. Though the government has repeatedly boasted of its commitment to a free press, a September 27 raid by armed military personnel on the offices of the Karachi-based English daily Dawn has raised grave concerns about freedom of speech in Pakistan. According to Dawn, the raid was preceded by legal notices to the newspaper from the Ministry of Information to restrict its coverage of a draft Freedom of Information Act, and by complaints from government officials about an article in Dawn stating that the administration was preparing new curbs on press freedom.","Asia, Pakistan",""

""""In circumstances like these, involving forces under separate national commands, a credible investigation must have an international dimension."""" Megally noted that Prime Minister Ehud Barak, under pressure from Israeli Arab leaders, has agreed to set up an independent national commission to look into the incidents in the Galilee in which ten Israeli Arabs were killed. Megally said that the events in the West Bank and Gaza and clashes involving Israeli and, in some cases, Palestinian security forces required a different approach. He also noted that Israeli commissions of inquiry in the past -- such as the Kahan Commission set up to investigate the role of Ariel Sharon and others in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982 and the 1987 Landau Commission that investigated the use of torture during interrogations -- issued reports but did not make public secret annexes.

He urged that such an independent panel comprise qualified individuals who would serve on the basis of their expertise and experience, rather than represent governments.

Clinton   The White House   Washington, DC   Dear Mr. President,   We, the directors of the undersigned U.S.-based international human rights organizations, are writing to convey our grave concern over reports that a grant of immunity or a country of safe haven is being considered for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. We believe that Milosevic should be arrested promptly and delivered to The Hague to stand trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).   The United States should make it unequivocally clear, immediately and before such proposals go further, that any country that provides Milosevic with safe haven would be in violation of international law and the statute creating the ICTY. The world should know that the United States will respond firmly to any attempt to grant immunity or asylum to Milosevic or any other indicted war criminal. We have written to the Secretary of State calling for the United States to """"state publicly that any country that offers or arranges safe haven for Milosevic will be in breach of Security Council requirements of cooperation with the ICTY and will trigger a diplomatic and economic response."""" The time for such a statement is now.   We wish to draw your attention to the statement of the spokesman of Carla Del Ponte, Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, who has pointed out that the only basis for withdrawal of the indictment would be a judicial request by the prosecutor to the Tribunal's chief judge. No judicial justification for such a request (i.e., wrongful indictment, lack of evidence, etc.) exists. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has also reminded the international community that """"the question of indictments...falls within the exclusive competence of the Prosecutor and the Trial Chambers.""""   Granting Milosevic immunity would inevitably give heart to other indicted war criminals who will be tempted to pursue similar abuses and crimes against humanity in the years ahead. Most important, the abandonment of any attempt to enforce the warrants for Milosevic, or, for that matter, other indictees, including Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, would make a mockery of the ICTY and of the civilized world's commitment to enforcing the rule of law. This tribunal stands as one of the great legacies of your administration. It must not be scrapped in the misguided pursuit of short-term expediency. Granting safe haven to the most prominent indicted war criminal would dishonor your legacy, disgrace the tribunal, and dim the prospects of establishing the rule of law.   Mr. President, we implore you to avoid any further ambiguity on the U.S. position on this matter. Without a clear indication that any such """"deal"""" would be rejected, the United States seems to signal acceptance of a grant of immunity to Milosevic as a lawful and reasonable option for action.

Guinea is host to the second largest refugee population in Africa - just under half a million refugees, 330,000 from Sierra Leone, and 126,000 from Liberia. Despite sheltering refugees from the turmoil in these countries for the past decade, it has received little international recognition and even less support for its long record of generous hospitality. Today Guinea faces a crisis of major proportions. The security situation in the sub-region has deteriorated drastically over the past months. Tensions have risen between Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, each accusing the other of supporting rebel activity. A series of cross-border attacks from both Liberia and Sierra Leone between August and October have claimed the lives of hundreds and injured many others. Most of these attacks have occurred close to the Sierra Leonean and Liberian borders, exactly the same areas where the refugee camps are located. The town of Macenta on the Liberian border was attacked on Friday, September 29, claiming 67 lives and forcing both Guineans and refugees to flee the area. The Guinean government has responded to these attacks by blaming the refugees on its territory. In early August, Guinea closed its borders with Sierra Leone, fearing further incursions by RUF rebels. By mid August as many as 10,000 refugees trying to flee into Guinea to escape RUF atrocities in Sierra Leone were trapped on the Sierra Leonean side of the border - most of them women and children. Conditions on the border were appalling and UNHCR reported that at least one pregnant woman and three children died while waiting to cross into Guinea. The situation for refugees in Guinea worsened further on September 9 when the President, Lansana Conte, made an inflammatory broadcast in which he blamed refugees for harboring rebels, declared that they should all go home, and rallied the Guinean population to defend their country and round-up all foreigners. These statements incited mob violence against Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees living in and around the capital, Conakry. For several days, armed groups of civilian militias, police and soldiers broke into refugees' homes, beat, raped and arrested them and looted their belongings. Over 5,000 people were detained and hundreds more sought refuge in the Sierra Leonean and Liberian embassies. Most of the refugees detained have since been released, but hundreds remain in the embassies, too afraid to return to their homes. Others have fled Guinea, many of them by boat back to Sierra Leone. Despite pleas for calm after the September 9 broadcast and assurances by Guinean government officials that Guinea would remain a safe country of asylum for refugees, on October 2 President Conte again blamed the refugees for the security, social and economic problems of his country in a public speech commemorating Guinea's 42nd anniversary of independence. The situation for refugees in the camps remains extremely critical. There have been reports of armed attacks on some of the refugee camps in the Forecariah region along the Sierra Leonean border, forcing many of the refugees to leave the area. The killing of the head of UNHCR's office and abduction of another staff member in Macenta, on September 17, highlights the dangers for humanitarian workers in the area, as well as for the refugees. The almost whole-scale withdrawal of international staff from the border region, while very understandable in light of the dangerous security situation, has left the refugees unprotected and largely unassisted and renders the camps even more vulnerable to attack with no outside witnesses. At the same time, Guinea's borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia remain closed to refugees fleeing conflict and human rights violations, and refugees in Guinea are faced with the unenviable choice of remaining unprotected in Guinea, or returning to Liberia and Sierra Leone. The prognosis for Guinea is poor. The chances of more cross-border attacks are high and the possibility of further retaliatory attacks, round-ups and arrests of refugees is very likely, particularly following President Conte's anti-refugee declarations of October 2. The future of safe asylum in Guinea is seriously at risk. The situation bears strong parallels to Macedonia in April 1999. Like Guinea, Macedonia is a small, relatively poor country in an unstable region with volatile neighbors. Like Guinea, Macedonia feared that the rapid influx of hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovar refugees would severely threaten its national security. And, like Guinea, Macedonia closed its borders to the fleeing refugees with serious humanitarian consequences. But, the world's media is not congregated in Guinea as it was in Macedonia, nor is the crisis occurring in the midst of the largest NATO offensive ever in Europe. Within days of Macedonia closing its borders western countries began an elaborate program of evacuating refugees. Their rationale was to relieve the pressure and stabilize the situation in Macedonia and thus ensure that the borders were kept open to Kosovar refugees. Human Rights Watch criticized the disparity in the international response to global refugee emergencies during the Kosovo crisis. We asked whether the international community would be willing to intervene to assist host countries elsewhere in the world in the same way as they had assisted Macedonia, especially when the political and military stakes were not so high. The current situation in Guinea provides our answer. The response of western countries has been negligible, the crisis has hardly touched the world media headlines, and there has certainly been no airlifting of refugees to safety. Yet, the situation in Guinea is as grave, if not graver, than the situation in Macedonia during the Kosovo crisis. The Guinean government must abide by its international obligations to provide safe asylum and protection to refugees and not to return anyone to a country where their life or freedom could be threatened. The international community must act now to assist Guinea. Funding and assistance must be provided: to help secure Guinea's borders and protect the refugees, to move the refugee camps away from the borders where they are vulnerable to cross-border attacks, and to assist with screening the refugees to separate out combatants, in accordance with international standards. A regional solution must be sought to the crisis. The international community cannot stand back and leave Guinea to cope with this emergency alone.","Africa, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Refugees and Migrants, Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape, Migrants"

Witnesses said police nearby took no action.  In a standoff that began at 4:30 p.m. on September 29 and lasted more than an hour, the officer threatened to kill Cheam Channy, a member of parliament who is part of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP). Five staff members from the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights arrived after being told about the trouble and tried unsuccessfully to get help from a military policeman and a traffic policeman at the scene. They in turn also came under threat. """"It's an outrage that an army officer can threaten a member of parliament and U.N. workers with a gun in broad daylight while the police just watch,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"As of today, police have issued no arrest warrant. This continues a pattern of state harassment of opposition members and human rights defenders and impunity for the perpetrators.""""  The standoff began as Cheam Channy was driving his car along Kampuchea Kraom street, from his home. He stopped at the intersection of Pochentong Boulevard to make a telephone call at a public telephone office, forty meters from the Military Intelligence Headquarters. A uniformed military intelligence officer, who was in a coffee shop next door, came out into the street and angrily confronted Cheam Channy, whom he appeared to recognize. The soldier shouted that he hated the """"despicable"""" opposition parties and pulled out a small revolver, which he aimed at Cheam Channy. One of the soldier's colleagues was able to restrain him.  Cheam Channy left his car and retreated to the other side of the street, where he alerted a military policeman and flagged down the car of another parliamentarian, who happened to be passing by. Together the two parliamentarians telephoned two generals, including Gen. Kieng Savon, who arrived on the scene thirty minutes later, around the same time as the U.N. staff members.  The U.N. workers sought intervention from a military police office and traffic policeman at the scene. The police said they could not take action without orders from their superiors. Calls were then placed to Col. Sim Hong, the deputy commander of the Municipal Military Police, who reportedly responded that the incident appeared to be a personal dispute that the parties could work out on their own. Col. Hong called back five minutes later to report that he had contacted the commander of the military intelligence. He suggested the U.N. staff members do the same to solve the problem. At no point did police or military authorities send in reinforcements.  A second confrontation, which lasted about fifteen minutes, occurred when Gen. Kieng Savon and U.N. staff members attempted to escort Channy back to his car. The Cambodia military officer who originally touched off the confrontation again pulled out his revolver, waved it around, and pointed it at Cheam Channy and the UN staff members. The general accompanying Gen. Kieng Savon pulled out his own gun and said, """"If you shoot us, we'll shoot you back."""" The officer then retreated, taking off on a motorcycle with another man.  At this point Gen. Kieng Savon reportedly said he could not arrest the officer, nor could he file a complaint. U.N. workers tried calling Col. Sim Hong again, but he had turned off his telephone.  Eventually UN staff were able to get Cheam Channy to safety. According to Channy, he had never seen the officer who threatened him before, but it appeared the man knew who Channy was. (Military Intelligence Deputy Commander Hour Sareth told the Cambodia Daily on October 2 that the accused soldier could not have had a gun because only officers who hold the rank of colonel and up are entitled to have guns.)  Cheam Channy, an opposition parliamentarian from Battambang province, has received several threats in the past, including one death threat received on his mobile telephone during a session of the National Assembly. During the last several months there have been numerous incidents of violence and harassment of members of Sam Rainsy's party, particularly members from Battambang province, where the party is popular and plans to field many candidates in upcoming commune-level elections.","Asia, Cambodia",""

""""Eurico Gutteres was one of the key thugs behind the violence in East Timor, and we've been waiting more than a year to see him behind bars,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The indictment will be meaningful only if he is quickly arrested and prosecuted. The Indonesian government has to demonstrate that it is serious about reining in these criminals.""""  Eurico Gutteres was one of the Indonesian army's main operatives throughout 1999 in East Timor, and the leader of the Dili-based militia Aitarak. He was indicted yesterday by the Indonesian Attorney General's office on charges of illegal possession of firearms. Under Eurico's direction, Aitarak took the lead in organizing pro-Indonesia rallies that often turned violent and leading attacks on independence supporters throughout 1999. After the independence vote on August 30, he helped coordinate the forced expulsion of tens of thousands of East Timorese across the border into Indonesia.  Despite the indictment, Eurico has not been detained and remains free to move around Indonesia. He has portrayed himself as a misunderstood champion of Indonesian unity and warned of angry reactions from followers in West Timor should he be arrested.  Human Rights Watch said the Indonesian government should follow the indictment by: detaining Eurico Gutteres and strengthening the charges against him;  explaining to the Indonesian public exactly what his criminal activities have been, including the role of Aitarak members in the scorched earth destruction of East Timor and in murderous attacks on civilians;  being prepared to immediately arrest and detain his followers in West Timor if they respond to the indictment with violence or other criminal acts;  making clear that the prosecution of criminals and thugs in West Timor will not end with this indictment; outlining a detailed plan for the separation of known criminals from the refugee population in West Timor, still believed to number about 100,000 and for the repatriation of all those who want to return to East Timor.  cooperating fully with a proposed delegation from the U.N. Security Council. Any such delegation should have a clear mandate to verify Indonesia's compliance with Security Council Resolution 1319, adopted on September 8, 2000, calling for """"immediate and effective action"""" to resolve the ongoing crisis in West Timor.  """"Eurico isn't a hero, he's a criminal,"""" said Saunders. """"But he's done a masterful job of manipulating Indonesian public opinion to paint himself as a victim, and top Indonesian officials have let him get away with it."""" Eurico Gutteres began his political activities as a young courier for Falintil, the East Timorese guerrilla force. As a youth, he was reputed to be a militant supporter of independence. He was arrested in 1991 following the army's firing on demonstrators in what has become known as the Dili massacre. When he was released from detention, he had changed sides and became a trusted tool of the Indonesian army. In 1995, he was appointed one of the top leaders of Gardapaksi, the Youth Front for Upholding Integration, an organization created by former President Soeharto's son-in-law, General Prabowo, to counter pro-independence activities. Gardapaksi, fully funded by the Indonesian government, was responsible for many attacks on suspected independence supporters between 1995 and late 1998. As international and church pressure to disband Gardapaksi increased, Eurico dissolved it, only to reorganize it, with the army's help, into the Aitarak militia in 1999.  Human Rights Watch reiterated its call that Indonesia's donors postpone their annual donor meeting, currently scheduled to be held in Tokyo October 17-18, until Indonesia acts to resolve the crisis in West Timor.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/01/georgia-backtracking-reform","Georgia- Backtracking on Reform","Georgia: Backtracking on Reform","Restrictions on Access to Courts """"Alarming""""","10/01/2000","In a report, Human Rights Watch documents Georgia's repeal of reforms that would have widened access to the courts to hear torture and other complaints of abuses by the police, procuracy, and security forces. While """"Dato,"""" a twenty-one-year-old Tbilisi resident, languished in a city jail, after being tortured for two days by electric shocks and beatings, the authorities refused to let his lawyers see him. Legal reforms adopted last year in Georgia would have allowed Dato's lawyers to complain about the refusal and the torture directly to a judge. But just weeks after the reform went into force, the new complaints procedures were repealed. The best Dato could hope for was an appeal to the procuracy, the very institution that would prosecute his case in court. """"The reforms would have strengthened civilian oversight—through the courts—of the police and other security forces,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"That's why this backtracking is so alarming. This also means that corrupt law enforcement has virtually unfettered power to coerce bribes from those whom they decide are under criminal investigation.""""  The Georgian parliament repealed these important reforms just weeks after Georgia was voted into the Council of Europe in April 1999. Since then, Georgia's abysmal record on torture has shown no improvement, and the report shows how the backtracking on legal reforms last year has contributed to continuing widespread, unchecked abuses.  The reforms affected the criminal procedure code, which governs criminal investigations and trials. Council of Europe experts had reviewed and the Georgian parliament had adopted the reformed criminal procedure code prior to Georgia's April 1999 admission to the organization. The Council is made up of the forty-one countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights. Countries that join the Council of Europe pledge to ensure that their national legislation and practice conform to convention standards. For some countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, membership in the Council is seen as the first step toward integration into other European institutions such as the European Union and NATO.  A criminal procedure code that had included the reformed complaints procedures went into force in May 1999. But after a series of amendments to the code, adopted in May and July 1999, access to a court to submit a complaint about a procedural violation has been severely restricted. This means that those under criminal investigation, as well as others who may be involved in investigations, such as witnesses, in many cases have to wait until a trial begins in order to submit a complaint about a procedural violation to a court.  Lawyers, victims and their families interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how police, procuracy and other investigators in Georgia simply refuse access to lawyers during the early stages of an investigation. These officials also misclassify criminal suspects as """"witnesses"""" to deprive them of rights that they should be entitled to, including to consult with a lawyer, or coerce detainees into hiring lawyers who will not complain or vigorously represent their interests. Defense lawyers noted that these tactics to restrict access to, or manipulate the choice of, a lawyer appear intended to suppress complaints of torture, to keep abusive officials from being prosecuted, and to prevent individuals who had signed false testimony or a confession from proving later that it had been obtained through torture.  Even later during the investigation, lawyers said that it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain an impartial forensic medical examination to back up a complaint of torture. Police, procuracy and other investigators simply deny lawyers' requests for examinations. Although an individual may appeal to higher-level officials in the procuracy, the agency responsible for carrying out criminal prosecutions in Georgia, he or she has little or no opportunity to complain to a court while waiting for the trial to begin. This restriction on access to a court is alarming because in Georgia criminal investigations can take as long as nine months, yet evidence needed to back up a torture complaint can be lost in as little as two weeks, as bruises from beatings and burn marks from electric shocks applied in police stations begin to heal.","Europe/Central Asia, Georgia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/01/municipal-elections-kosovo","Municipal Elections in Kosovo","Municipal Elections in Kosovo","A Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","10/01/2000","Introduction Municipal elections in Kosovo will take place on October 28, 2000. As in Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo's first post-conflict elections will have a profound impact in shaping the democratic development of the province, with ramifications for the rule of law, human rights, and the overall security situation. The experience of Bosnia demonstrates that unless elections are conducted in conformity with the highest international standards, the results will serve only to undermine international efforts to build a lasting peace in Kosovo. Yet to date, preparations for the elections appear to have been driven more by the desire to meet a pre-determined deadline set for the poll, than the need to create the minimum conditions necessary for free and fair elections, established by the OSCE Document of the Copenhagen Meeting on the Human Dimension. This paper outlines the legal framework for the elections, examines the experience of Bosnia and Hercegovina, critically assesses the security situation, the role of the media and plans for enforcing election standards, and notes concerns related to election monitoring and the implementation of results. Finally, it sets out recommendations to the OSCE and the Council of Europe for the conduct, monitoring and certification of the elections.  The International Standards United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 clearly envisages self-government through an electoral process prior to a political settlement on the status of Kosovo. Paragraph 11, section C states: """"The main responsibilities of the international civil presence will include overseeing the development of provisional institutions for democratic and autonomous self-government pending a political settlement, including the holding of elections."""" The conditions necessary for the holding of free and fair elections are laid down in the draft Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo (generally referred to as the """"Rambouillet Agreement""""), which was drafted by the inter-governmental Contact Group on Kosovo and agreed upon by the Kosovo Albanian delegation to the Rambouillet talks. According to Chapter 3, Article 1, section 1 of the agreement, the necessary conditions include: a) freedom of movement for all citizens; b) an open and free political environment; c) an environment conducive to the return of displaced persons; d) a safe and secure environment that ensures freedom of assembly, association, and expression; e) an electoral legal framework of rules and regulations complying with OSCE commitments, which will be implemented by a Central Election Commission, as set forth in Article III, which is representative of the population of Kosovo in terms of national communities and political parties; and f) free media, effectively accessible to registered political parties and candidates, and available to voters throughout Kosovo. Section 3 of the same article also obliges the parties to the agreement to """"comply fully with Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the OSCE Copenhagen Document [on the Human Dimension]."""" The 1990 Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE (later OSCE) enumerates the OSCE's standards on the conduct of free and fair elections.(1) Key provisions are contained in paragraph 7, especially the obligation to: (7.3) - guarantee universal and equal suffrage to adult citizens; (7.7) - ensure that law and public policy work to permit political campaigning to be conducted in a fair and free atmosphere in which neither administrative action, violence nor intimidation bars the parties and the candidates from freely presenting their views and qualifications, or prevents the voters from learning and discussing them or from casting their vote free of fear of retribution; (7.8) - provide that no legal or administrative obstacle stands in the way of unimpeded access to the media on a non-discriminatory basis for all political groupings and individuals wishing to participate in the electoral process; (7.9) - ensure that the candidates who obtain the necessary number of votes required by the law are duly installed in office and are permitted to remain in office until their term expires or is otherwise brought to end in a manner that is regulated by law in conformity with democratic parliamentary and constitutional procedures; Ambassador Daan Everts, the Head of Mission of the OSCE Mission to Kosovo has stated that the forthcoming elections """"must be credible."""" Human Rights Watch believes that unless the elections are conducted according to the OSCE's own standards set out in the Copenhagen document, they will be neither credible nor consonant with the provision of U.N. resolution 1244 that charges the international civilian presence with the development of democratic provisional institutions through the holding of elections.  The Experience of Bosnia and Hercegovina The international community's experience in organizing and conducting elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina is relevant in assessing preparations for municipal elections in Kosovo. Although it is important not to overstate the similarities, in both situations the international community was directly charged with staging elections in territories that have little or no prior experience of direct electoral democracy. In Kosovo, as in the case of Bosnia and Hercegovina, the elections are taking place soon after the termination of a bitter conflict characterized by large-scale violations of human rights, including mass deportation and executions. In both, the parties to the conflict have yet to resolve their differences, and human rights abuses continue. Many Western diplomats, including NATO officials and representatives from international organizations in Bosnia and Hercegovina, have acknowledged to Human Rights Watch that one of the international community's biggest errors in Bosnia was to hold elections prematurely. In the absence of conditions for free and fair elections, notably freedom of expression, movement and assembly, and with continued attacks on minority populations, the 1996 national and entity-level elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina served only to legitimize further the nationalist political parties and their leaders. It is worth recalling the warning issued by then-OSCE Chairman-in-Office (and Swiss Foreign Minister) Flavio Cotti in his June 1996 statement at the OSCE Permanent Council on pre-certification of the September 1996 Bosnian elections. Mr. Cotti noted that at the time of his statement, conditions did not exist for free and fair elections, and warned that unless significant progress was made toward creating those conditions prior to the elections, the result would be a """"pseudo-democratic legitimization of extreme nationalist power structures."""" The more recent actions by the international community's High Representative in Bosnia and Hercegovina to dismiss elected officials opposed to the implementation of the Dayton-Paris peace agreement indicate the accuracy of Mr. Cotti's prediction. The international community's experience with the implementation of the results of the 1997 municipal elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina is also relevant. Efforts to permit displaced persons to vote for representatives in their former municipalities resulted in minority representation in a significant number of municipalities. The implementation of those results proved far more difficult than the arrangements for voting, as incumbent officials and local authorities erected obstacles to prevent representatives elected by former residents from taking up their seats on municipal councils. Representatives elected by former residents were also frequently subjected to violence and intimidation when they attempted to travel to their municipal offices to take up their duties as elected officials.  The Pre-Election Climate in Kosovo More than a year after the end of the war in Kosovo, the security situation in the province remains a cause for serious concern. Attacks on minorities, including murder, continue. The weeks surrounding the first anniversary of the entry of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) into Kosovo in June saw an upsurge in violence against minorities in the province. A series of grenade and land-mine attacks and drive-by shootings targeting Serbs left eleven dead and more than a dozen wounded. Violence continued during the summer: On July 12, a Serbian Orthodox priest and two seminary students were wounded in a drive-by shooting near the village of Klokot. A grenade was thrown from a moving car into a group of children at a basketball court in the Serb village of Crkvena Vodica on August 18, leaving ten wounded. On August 27, an Albanian man drove his car into a group of children in the same village before fleeing the scene, killing one child and wounding three. An eighty-year-old Serb farmer from the same village was shot dead later the same day. On September 14, a forty-five-year-old Serb woman was shot dead at her home in Kamenica. A sixty-year-old Serb shepherd who had been reported missing was discovered dead near Strpce on October 4, with gun-shot wounds to the body. With most minorities displaced outside Kosovo or living in minority enclaves under permanent KFOR guard, the decision by Serbs to boycott registration should have come as little surprise, even without the alleged manipulation by then-Yugoslav president Milosevic. In the case of Kosovo's minorities, therefore, it is hard to argue that the minimum conditions exist for the holding of free and fair elections. Kosovo's Albanian majority, more than a million of whom have registered to vote in the elections, have also been plagued by post-war violence. The murder of a politician from the Democratic League of Kosovo, the party headed by Ibrahim Rugova and known by its Albanian acronym, LDK, and the kidnaping and interrogation of another in the Drenica region in November 1999 have been followed by a spate of execution-style killings of prominent ex-members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the most recent on September 20. Although the killings are frequently attributed to rivalries among organized crime figures, some of the murders, including May's killing in Prizren of the political moderate and prominent former-KLA leader Ekrem Rexha (known as Commander """"Drini""""), have a clear political dimension. Political violence has increased over the summer. On June 15 Alil Dresaj, a senior LDK politician, was shot dead by persons wearing insignia of the former KLA. On July 7, Ramush Haradinaj, a leading politician and former senior KLA official, was wounded in the village of Streoce during what appears to have been a shootout. On July 12, a close aide to Haradinaj was murdered. The burned corpse of Shaban Manaj, a senior LDK official, was discovered on August 6 in a remote village. He had been kidnaped on July 27. Attacks directed against the LDK continued in August. On August 1, an LDK activist was shot and wounded in Podujevo. The head of the LDK in Srbica was wounded in a shooting the following day. The wife of an LDK official died in an explosion at their home in Dragash on August 9. Several LDK offices were attacked during the same month. On August 18, a bomb exploded at an OSCE building in central Pristina. The building was used to house several smaller political parties, including Bosniak and Turkish parties contesting the election, and the representative office of the Yugoslav government. Many observers suspect political motives in the September murders of Shefki Popova and Rexhep Luci, two prominent Albanians with close ties to the LDK: Popova, a veteran journalist (see media section, below) and Luci, head of Kosovo's housing and reconstruction department, were gunned down on consecutive days. On October 6, a municipal elections candidate from the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK, the party headed by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci), was arrested in connection with a triple-bomb attack in Prizren three days earlier. In addition to the risk of further violence, there is a real danger of intimidation. Efforts to establish a local judiciary in Kosovo have been hampered by frequent reports of the intimidation of local judges, especially on """"sensitive"""" cases involving minority defendants or prominent political figures. Some international officials now acknowledge that the nascent judiciary in the province demands the same degree of international supervision as the Kosovo Police Service. Election officials, party representatives and voters are likely to be subjected to similar pressures during the election campaign and particularly during the voting and counting of results. Without a marked improvement in security and a high degree of international supervision and protection, it is unlikely that elections will be conducted in an atmosphere free from """"violence...intimidation [or] fear of retribution,"""" in accordance with paragraph 7, section (7) of the Copenhagen document.  The Role of the Media Freedom of expression and access to the media under paragraph 7, section (8) of the Copenhagen document are key elements of the conduct of free and fair elections. Yet there are serious constraints to freedom of expression in Kosovo at present, notably in the form of attacks on journalists. On September 10, Shefki Popova, a senior correspondent with the Albanian-language daily Rilindija, died in the town of Vucitrn after being shot and repeatedly stabbed by two unidentified men. Rilindija is widely seen as close to the LDK. The killing followed the disappearance a day earlier of Marjan Melonasi, a journalist from a ethnically-mixed family who worked with the Serbian-language service of Kosovo Radio-Television. On June 20, Valentina Cukic, the editor of a Serbian-language program of the multi-ethnic Radio Kontakt, was shot and badly wounded. Last year, the publisher and editor of Koha Ditore were verbally attacked and threatened after publishing an editorial condemning attacks on minorities. In addition to the intimidation of journalists, biased coverage of the elections is also a concern. Although the internationally-funded electronic media are balanced in their coverage, many Albanian language daily newspapers and some private radio stations are extremely partisan in their reporting on politics in Kosovo. The international community is clearly well aware of the dangers to the free and fair elections posed by inflammatory reporting and intimidation of journalists. A variety of measures have been introduced, including an UNMIK regulation forbidding hate speech, a code of conduct and training for journalists, European Union-funded media monitoring by the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, the explicit prohibition in the election code of conduct on the use by political parties of language that """"incites hatred,"""" and the decision to include media monitoring in the mandate of the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission. Nevertheless, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and the Central Election Commission must guard against the possibility that the inflammatory rhetoric used by radio stations and mainstream newspapers will be used to incite violence during the election period, and the conduct of the media during the election should be fully incorporated into the final assessment of the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission.  Enforcement of Election Standards As in Bosnia and Hercegovina, the enforcement of the international standards in the organization and conduct of the elections in Kosovo presents a major challenge to the international community. In particular there are concerns that the bodies set up to enforce electoral standards will be subject to international and local pressure to ignore serious violations or to use only perfunctory sanctions to punish them. The main yardstick for the conduct of the parties during the election, aside from the international standards discussed above, is the Code of Conduct for the elections, which spells out the obligations of the parties. Two bodies are responsible for enforcement of the code and international election standards.(2) The Central Election Commission (CEC) has overarching responsibility for all aspects of the elections, including compliance with the Code. The CEC is chaired by the OSCE Mission Chief, Ambassador Daan Everts, assisted by two international and nine local deputies. Decisions are made by consensus, although the Chair has the right to decided unilaterally if consensus cannot be reached. The Election Claims and Appeals Sub-Commission (ECAC) has specific responsibility for ensuring compliance with the electoral code. According to Electoral Rule number 2000/2, the ECAC is responsible for """"adjudicating all complaints concerning the electoral process.""""(3) The ECAC consists of an international commissioner, Dieter Schoene and two local deputies. It has the right to hear complaints and appeals from any party or individual, as well as international agencies. As with the Central Commission, the decisions of the ECAC are made by consensus with the Chief Commissioner having the right to decide unilaterally in the event of deadlock. It has the power to order corrective action to be taken and to impose fines of up to 10,000 Deutsche Marks (approximately U.S.$4450). More serious penalties such as removing a candidate from a party list or banning a party from contesting the elections can be made only with the approval of the Central Election Commission. Decisions by the ECAC are final and cannot be appealed. The experience of Bosnia and Hercegovina indicates that both bodies are likely to be faced with potentially explosive decisions, such as whether to impose sanctions on leading parties that may result in a reduction in the number of candidates they are permitted to field or even ban them from contesting some municipalities. Local officials on the Central Election Commission and Election Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission are likely to be subject to pressures similar to those faced by judges and prosecutors in Kosovo, increasing the risk of deadlock among their members. Kosovo's political parties are unlikely to be the only source of pressure on the Central Election Commission and the Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission. During preparations for national, entity-level and municipal elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1996, the Bosnian Provisional Election Commission (PEC) came under significant pressure from some OSCE member governments to hold the national and entity-level elections despite the absence of the conditions set out by then-OSCE Chairman-in-Office Flavio Cotti, as well as pressure to go ahead with simultaneous municipal elections, despite clear indications from OSCE field offices that the necessary conditions did not exist. While the municipal elections were eventually postponed, the decision to go ahead with the vote at the national and entity level resulted in flawed elections in which existing nationalist parties in each of the communities were able to further consolidate power. An equally troubling precedent can be found in the interference in the work of the OSCE's Electoral Appeals Sub-Commission (EASC) during the 1997 municipal elections in Bosnia. The Bosnian Provisional Election Commission initially made a correct decision to constitute the Bosnian Election Appeals Sub-Commission as an independent judicial panel to assess possible violations of the election law and apply sanctions where necessary. During the 1997 elections, however, the Head of Bosnian Election Commission (and OSCE Mission Chief) Ambassador Robert Frowick overturned several key rulings by the Bosnian EASC where it had struck candidates from a party's list for flagrant violations of the election rules. This interference in the work of the Bosnian election appeals body undermined the integrity of the elections and led several of its members to resign in protest. Given the OSCE's experience with the EASC in Bosnia, the decision to constitute an appeals subcommission in Kosovo with limited independent powers of sanction suggests a conscious decision to create an emasculated subcommission. To date the Kosovo ECAC has functioned effectively, issuing a handful of rulings against parties for violations of the election code. In all but one case, it has imposed corrective action or relatively small fines. On October 3, however, the ECAC struck a candidate from the PDK party list in Lipljan, after the violent disruption of an LDK election rally in the town. The decision to strike the candidate was an encouraging sign that the ECAC is willing to use more serious sanctions in order to ensure compliance with the election rules. Nevertheless, the experience of Bosnia indicates that if serious irregularities occur that threaten the integrity of the elections in Kosovo, the Kosovo Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission is likely to come under considerable pressure to refrain from recommending that the offending candidates or parties be prevented from running in the elections.  Election Monitoring Effective and impartial monitoring of the campaign, events on voting day, and the counting and tabulation of results are crucial to the integrity of any election process. The decision to invite the Council of Europe to coordinate election monitoring rather than depending on the organization responsible for the conduct of the elections, namely the OSCE, is therefore both a welcome development and a significant departure from previous polls organized by the international community in the region. That innovation aside, the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission follows a traditional pattern, with the deployment of a small team of long-term observers to monitor preparations for the elections, including the already completed registration process, the conduct of the campaign and the functioning of the Central Election Commission. Several days prior to the vote, 150 short-term observers coordinated by the Mission will be deployed for an eight-day period to observe the voting process throughout the province. The Mission has complained of delay in the deployment of long-term observers: the first report indicated that as of August 8, slightly less than two-thirds of the nineteen long-term observed were present in Kosovo.(4) Although the Mission's first report is largely confined to an assessment of the registration process, early indications suggest that the Mission values its independence and intends to accurately reflect the """"conformity of the election process with international standards.""""(5) If the experience of Bosnia is indicative, the Mission's commitment to those values may be severely tested if serious irregularities occur. In such a situation, there is likely to be considerable pressure from some western governments to overlook the problems and to certify the elections regardless.  The Implementation of Results As noted above, implementing election results was one of the major challenges arising from the internationally-organized municipal elections in Bosnia. The difficulties in Bosnia were related to installing local officials representing one ethnic group in areas now dominated by another. In Kosovo, there is a majority Albanian population and Serbs in the province are boycotting the election. This does not mean, however, that issues over implementation will not arise. It is important to recall that de facto local authorities were established throughout Kosovo following the end of the war in June 1999. In many cases, those authorities were dominated by, or had strong links to, the Kosovo Liberation Army. Current polls show Ibrahim Rugova's LDK enjoying a lead over its main rival, the PDK, which is headed by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and has strong ties to the former KLA throughout Kosovo. In the event of widespread victories for the LDK, many of the current de facto municipal authorities dominated by the KLA will be called upon to hand over power to their rivals. Under those circumstances, difficulties over implementation may arise.  Recommendations: To the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and its member states Pre-Election Certification  No later that 48 hours prior to the vote, the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office should certify whether conditions necessary for the conduct of free and fair municipal elections in Kosovo exist. Those conditions should be based on paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Copenhagen document. The decision to certify should give due consideration to the recommendation of the Council of Europe Election Monitoring Mission (see below). If conditions do not exist, the elections should be postponed.  Enforcing Electoral Standards  The powers of the Election Complaints and Appeals Sub-Commission should be enhanced. In particular, the subcommission should have recourse to effective sanctions in the most serious cases of electoral misconduct. Its rulings should not be subject to approval or veto by the Central Election Commission or its Chairman. Violations of the Code of Conduct that also constitute violations of the criminal or civil code should also be investigated by United Nations Civilian Police.  To the Council of Europe and its member states: Pre-Election Monitoring  Member states must ensure that the Council of Europe monitoring mission in Kosovo has adequate staff and resources to carry out its tasks throughout the electoral process.  Pre-Election Certification  Prior to any decision by the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office regarding pre-election certification, the Council of Europe monitoring mission should prepare a public report detailing the work of the mission in monitoring the registration period and the assessing the conditions for elections. It should include a recommendation regarding pre-election certification. The report should be submitted to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, to the Head of UNMIK, to the Chairman of the Central Election Commission and to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  Post-Election Certification  Final certification of elections should be issued by the head of the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission not by the head of the Central Election Commission or OSCE Chairperson-in-Office. The certification should measure actual performance against the criteria laid down in international election standards including the Copenhagen Document, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Member states must ensure that the independence of the Election Observation Mission is respected, particularly in the event of serious irregularities in the vote.  1.  The universal right to participate in democratic elections is established by article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 2.

Newly-elected Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has pledged to respect human rights and re-establish the rule of law in Yugoslavia. Correcting miscarriages of justice such as those perpetrated against Kosovo Albanian political prisoners is an essential part of upholding this pledge. The Humanitarian Law Center and Human Rights Watch also recognize the urgent need to address the problem of missing persons, Serbs and Albanians alike, in the wake of the Kosovo conflict. The new authorities in Belgrade and the U.N. administration in Kosovo should initiate a joint effort to resolve this legacy of the war.  Political Prisoners: The Facts  Upon the signing of the June 10, 1999, Military-Technical Agreement between Yugoslavia and NATO that ended the Kosovo war, an estimated 2,100 Kosovo Albanians were transferred from prisons in Kosovo to Serbia proper. The majority were civilians unlawfully arrested by Serbian security forces during the war. As of October 13, 2000, 1,250 Kosovo Albanian prisoners have been released.  Of the 850 Kosovo Albanian prisoners who remain in Serbian prisons, an estimated 650 are political prisoners, charged with either hostile activity against the state or terrorism. The remaining 200 are serving prison sentences for non-political crimes. Fourteen of the political prisoners, including two minors, have been in detention for seventeen months without any formal charges. The rest are either on trial, awaiting appeal, or have already had their appeals reviewed by the Serbian Supreme Court or the Military Supreme Court. The political prisoners were routinely denied the right to a fair trial. Courts sentenced Kosovo Albanians on the basis of forced confessions, and judges frequently refused the introduction of evidence that could have disproved the charges. The prosecution's primary evidence against those convicted was the highly unreliable and discredited """"paraffin test,"""" which checks for gunpowder on defendants' hands. According to the Yugoslav constitution and federal law, the Yugoslav president is empowered to pardon those indicted or convicted of federal crimes, such as hostile activity against the state and terrorism.  Recommendations To the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities: The Serbian Supreme Court should urgently review those political cases of Kosovo Albanians pending appeal and acquit all those defendants for whom evidence is lacking. President Kostunica should immediately review all political cases of Kosovo Albanians in Serbia that have been ruled on by the Serbian Supreme Court or the Military Supreme Court. Those prisoners for whom there is no evidence should be released without delay. The Humanitarian Law Center and Human Rights Watch, who either represented the defendants or monitored their trials, stand ready to provide information that would assist in this review. President Kostunica should facilitate the immediate release of the fourteen detainees held for seventeen months without charges. The release of Kosovo Albanian political prisoners should not be linked to the fate of missing persons or those who have been forced to flee Kosovo. To the International Community: The European Union and United Nations, as well as individual governments, should urge President Kostunica and the future Serbian and Yugoslav governments to demonstrate their commitment to the rule of law by reviewing these cases and releasing all those arrested or convicted on unsubstanted political charges.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/09/30/october-28-2000-municipal-elections-kosovo","October 28 2000 -- Municipal Elections in Kosovo","October 28, 2000 -- Municipal Elections in Kosovo","","09/30/2000","Municipal elections in Kosovo will take place on October 28, 2000. As in Bosnia and Hercegovina,  Kosovo's first post-conflict elections will have a profound impact in shaping the democratic  development of the province, with ramifications for the rule of law, human rights, and the overall  security situation. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is organizing the elections,  which were mandated by the 1999 Rambouillet agreement. The experience of Bosnia demonstrates that unless Kosovo's first post-war elections follow the highest international standards, the results will serve only to undermine international efforts to build a lasting peace in Kosovo. Yet to date, preparations for the elections appear to have been driven more by the desire to meet the pre-determined deadline set for the poll, than the need to create the minimum international standards necessary for free and fair elections. The Pre-Election Climate in Kosovo Basic requirements for a free and fair vote in Kosovo include adequate protections for ethnic minorities, freedom of movement, a free media, and an environment free of political violence that can ensure freedom of assembly, association, and expression. These conditions are lacking in Kosovo today. More than a year after the end of the war in Kosovo, the security situation in the province remains a cause for serious concern. Attacks on minorities, including murder, continue. On July 12, a Serbian Orthodox priest and two seminary students were wounded in a drive-by shooting near the village of Klokot. A grenade was thrown from a moving car into a group of children at a basketball court in the Serb village of Crkvena Vodica on August 18, leaving ten wounded. On August 27, an Albanian man drove his car into a group of Serb children in the same village before fleeing the scene, killing one child and wounding three. An eighty-year-old Serb farmer from the same village was shot dead later the same day. On September 14, a forty-five-year old Serb woman was shot dead at her home in Kamenica. A sixty-year-old Serb shepherd who had been reported missing was discovered dead near Strpce on October 4, with gun-shot wounds to the body.  With most minorities displaced outside Kosovo or living in minority enclaves under permanent guard by troops from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), the decision by Serbs to boycott registration should have come as little surprise, even without the alleged manipulation by then-Yugoslav president Milosevic. In the case of Kosovo's minorities, therefore, it is hard to argue that the minimum conditions exist for the holding of free and fair elections.  Kosovo's Albanian majority, more than a million of whom have registered to vote in the elections, have also been plagued by post-war political violence. In November, a politician from the Democratic League of Kosovo, the party headed by Ibrahim Rugova and known by its Albanian acronym, LDK, was murdered another in the Drenica region was kidnapped and interrogated. These incidents were followed by a spate of execution-style killings of prominent ex-members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the most recent on September 20. Although the killings are frequently attributed to rivalries among organized crime figures, some of the murders are clearly political. They include May's killing in Prizren of the political moderate and prominent former-KLA leader Ekrem Rexha (known as Commander """"Drini"""").  Political violence has increased over the summer. On June 15 Alil Dresaj, a senior LDK politician, was shot dead by persons wearing the insignia of the former KLA. On July 7, Ramush Haradinaj, a politician and former senior KLA commander, was wounded in the village of Streoce during what appears to have been a shootout. On July 12, a close aide to Haradinaj was murdered. The burned corpse of Shaban Manaj, a senior LDK official, was discovered on August 6 in a remote village. He had been kidnaped on July 27. Attacks directed against the LDK continued in August. On August 1, an LDK activist was shot and wounded in Podujevo. The head of the LDK in Srbica was wounded in a shooting the following day. The wife of an LDK official died in an explosion at their home in Dragash on August 9. Several LDK offices were attacked during the same month.  On August 18, a bomb exploded at an OSCE building in central Pristina. The building was used to house several smaller political parties, including Bosniak and Turkish parties contesting the election, and the representative office of the Yugoslav government. Many observers suspect political motives in the September murders of Shefki Popova and Rexhep Luci, two prominent Albanians with close ties to the LDK: Popova, a veteran journalist (see media section, below) and Luci, head of Kosovo's housing and reconstruction department, were gunned down on consecutive days. On October 6, a municipal elections candidate from the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK, the party headed by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci), was arrested in connection with a triple-bomb attack in Prizren three days earlier.  The Role of the Media  There are serious constraints to freedom of expression in Kosovo at present, notably in the form of attacks on journalists. On September 10, Shefki Popova, a senior correspondent with Albanian-language daily Rilindija, died in the town of Vucitrn after being shot and repeatedly stabbed by two unidentified men. Rilindija is widely seen as close to the LDK. The killing followed the disappearance a day earlier of Marjan Melonasi, a journalist from a ethnically-mixed family who worked with the Serbian-language service of Kosovo Radio-Television. On June 20, Valentina Cukic, the editor of a Serbian-language program of the multi-ethnic Radio Kontakt, was shot and badly wounded. Last year, the publisher and editor of Koha Ditore were verbally attacked and threatened after publishing an editorial condemning attacks on minorities. In addition to the intimidation of journalists, biased coverage of the elections is also a concern. Although the internationally-funded electronic media are balanced in their coverage, many daily newspapers and some private radio stations are extremely partisan in their reporting on politics in Kosovo.  The international community is clearly well aware of the dangers to the free and fair elections posed by inflammatory reporting and intimidation of journalists. A variety of measures have been introduced, including an UNMIK regulation forbidding hate speech, a code of conduct and training for journalists, media monitoring by the OSCE, the explicit prohibition in the election code of conduct on the use by political parties of language that """"incites hatred,"""" and the decision to include media monitoring in the mandate of the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission. Nevertheless, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and the Central Election Commission must guard against the possibility that the inflammatory rhetoric used by radio stations and mainstream newspapers will be used to incite violence during the election period.  Enforcement of Election Standards As in Bosnia and Hercegovina, enforcing international standards in the organization and conduct of the elections in Kosovo presents a major challenge to the international community. In particular there are concerns that the bodies set up to enforce these standards will be subject to international and local pressure to ignore serious violations or to use only perfunctory sanctions to punish them.  The main yardstick for the conduct of the parties during the election is the Code of Conduct for the elections, which spells out their obligations in accordance with international standards. Two bodies are responsible for enforcing the code. The Central Election Commission (CEC) has overarching responsibility for all aspects of the elections. It is chaired by the OSCE Mission Chief, Ambassador Daan Everts, assisted by two international and nine local deputies. The Election Claims and Appeals Sub-Commission (ECAC) has specific responsibility for ensuring compliance with the electoral code. The ECAC consists of an international commissioner, Dieter Schoene, and two local deputies. Its decisions are made by consensus with the Chief Commissioner having the right to decide unilaterally in the event of deadlock. The ECAC has the power to order corrective action to be taken and to impose fines of up to 10,000 Deutsche marks (approximately U.S.$4450). More serious penalties, such as removing a candidate from a party list or banning a party from contesting the elections, can be made only with the approval of the Central Election Commission.  Experience from Bosnia and Hercegovina indicates that both bodies are likely to be faced with potentially explosive decisions, such as whether to impose sanctions on leading parties that may result in a reduction in the number of candidates they are permitted to field or even ban them from contesting some municipalities. Kosovo's political parties are unlikely to be the only source of pressure on the CEC and the ECAC. During preparations for elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1996, the Bosnian Election Commission came under significant pressure from some OSCE member governments to proceed with elections despite the absence of the minimum conditions. While the municipal elections were ultimately postponed, the decision to go ahead with the vote at the national and entity level resulted in flawed elections in which existing nationalist parties in each of the communities were able to further consolidate power.  Election Monitoring Effective and impartial monitoring of the campaign, events on voting day, and the counting and tabulation of results are crucial to the integrity of any election process. The Council of Europe will coordinate election monitoring. This is a welcome departure from past practice, in which the OSCE was responsible both for the conduct of the elections in the region and for monitoring them. That innovation aside, the Council of Europe Election Observation Mission follows a traditional pattern, with the deployment of a small team of long-term observers to monitor preparations for the elections, including the already completed registration process, the conduct of the campaign and the functioning of the Central Election Commission. Several days prior to the vote, 150 short-term observers coordinated by the Mission will be deployed for an eight-day period to observe the voting process throughout the province. Early indications suggest that the Mission values its independence and intends to measure accurately the election against international standards. If the experience of Bosnia is indicative, the Mission's commitment to those values may be severely tested if serious irregularities occur. In such a situation, there is likely to be considerable pressure from some Western governments to overlook the problems and to certify the elections regardless.  Implementing The Election Results As noted above, implementing the results of the elections was one of the major challenges arising from the internationally-organized municipal elections in Bosnia. Although the difficulties in Bosnia were related to installing local officials representing one ethnic group in areas now dominated by another, it would be a mistake to imagine that Kosovo's majority Albanian population and the Serb boycott of the elections mean that issues over implementation will not arise. It is important to recall that de facto local authorities were established throughout Kosovo following the end of the war in June 1999. In many cases, those authorities were dominated by, or had strong links to, the KLA. Current polls show Ibrahim Rugova's LDK enjoying a lead over its main rival, the PDK, which is headed by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and has strong ties to the former KLA throughout Kosovo. In the event of widespread LDK victories, many of the current de facto municipal authorities dominated by the KLA may be reluctant to hand over power to their rivals.  International Standards International standards governing the elections aim to foster an environment conducive to a free and fair vote. They derive from a variety of sources. United Nations Security Council resolution 1244, which established the international civilian and military presence in Kosovo, states that """"the main responsibilities of the international civil presence will include overseeing the development of provisional institutions for democratic and autonomous self-government pending a political settlement, including the holding of elections."""" The conditions necessary for holding free and fair elections are laid down in Rambouillet Agreement, which was drafted by the international community and agreed upon by the Kosovo Albanian delegation to the Rambouillet talks. The Rambouillet conditions include: freedom of movement; an open and free political environment; an environment conducive to the return of displaced persons; a safe and secure environment that ensures freedom of assembly, association, and expression; and free media.  The Rambouillet agreement also obliges the parties to """"comply fully with Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the OSCE Copenhagen Document."""" The 1990 Copenhagen Document on the Human Dimension enumerates the OSCE's standards on the conduct of free and fair elections. Key provisions are contained in paragraph 7, including the obligations to: """"guarantee universal and equal suffrage to adult citizens,"""" and """"to permit political campaigning to be conducted in a fair and free atmosphere in which neither administrative action, violence nor intimidation bars the parties and the candidates from freely presenting their views and qualifications, or prevents the voters from learning and discussing them or from casting their vote free of fear of retribution.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/09/28/letter-secretary-general-organization-american-states","Letter to Secretary General Organization of American States","Letter to Secretary General, Organization of American States","","09/28/2000","Dr. César Gaviria Secretary General Organization of American States 17th and Constitution Avenue Washington, DC 20006   Dear Mr. Secretary General:   I write to express Human Rights Watch's deep concern about your intervention to secure political asylum in Panama for Vladimiro Montesinos Torres, former advisor to President Alberto Fujimori and de facto head of the Peruvian National Intelligence Service (SIN). I refer to your letter of September 23 addressed to the Foreign Minister of Panama, José Miguel Alemán, in which you requested the government of Panama to reconsider its earlier decision to refuse political asylum to Montesinos. In your letter you cite your mandate under the June 5 resolution at the OAS General Assembly in Windsor, Canada, to further the process of democratic reform in Peru.   In recommending that Panama grant political asylum to an individual widely believed to be responsible for grave violations of human rights, you are asking an OAS member state to breach a basic principle of international asylum law. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees provides:   F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:   (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;   (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;   (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.   Vladimiro Montesinos's conduct would disqualify him from political asylum on any of the three grounds listed above. First, he has been credibly implicated in illegal abductions, torture and extrajudicial executions as the organizer of a death squad responsible for crimes against humanity in two cases currently under investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (the La Cantuta and Barrios Altos cases). Second, he is guilty of other serious crimes committed in Peru. The video whose exhibition spurred his request for asylum apparently showed him in the act of bribing a public official, a serious crime in any country. To this must be added credible allegations that Montesinos was involved in illegal wiretapping, drug-trafficking and illegal arms dealing, none of have been satisfactorily investigated in Peru due to his power and influence in Congress and the judiciary. Third, Montesinos is guilty of numerous actions subverting the rule of law and democratic institutions in Peru, acts that are clearly contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.   It is the height of cynicism for Montesinos to claim, as he did in a recent letter to President Mireya Moscoso of Panama, that he is a victim of political persecution in Peru. What political refugee, one must ask, has his own government pave the way for his exit from the country, secure him a place of asylum, provide him with lodging and a military escort, and pass a resolution praising him for """"services to the nation""""? It is obvious that Montesinos expects Panama to grant his request for asylum not on its merits, but because of his continuing capacity to disrupt Peru's return to democracy, and to threaten the stability of the region. In his calculations he obviously has taken into account the weight of the recommendations to Panama of the OAS Secretariat and of key member states.   We are very concerned that providing Montesinos political asylum in a third country will protect him from future prosecution for human rights violations and other crimes. Such was evidently his intention in insisting on efforts to secure him asylum as a condition for leaving Peru. It now appears that Montesinos's threats to carry out a military coup were no more than a bargaining ploy to secure refugee protection in return for abandoning power, or appearing to abandon it. Giving in to these threats sets a deplorable precedent, one that conveys the message to potential dictators across the region that crime, manipulation and brinkmanship will be rewarded, and that subordinates fundamental human rights principles to political expediency.   In practice, appeasing Montesinos is likely to have the opposite effect from that intended by the States that are currently trying to convince Panama to grant him asylum. It offers no guarantees that Montesinos will desist from further efforts to sabotage the process of democratic reform in Peru. Montesinos has been accompanied in Panama by eleven high-ranking Peruvian military officers, who arrived without authorization on September 24. Seven of them were deported on September 27 when their presence became known to the Panamanian authorities. Montesinos maintains contact with army officers in Peru that he appointed to key posts. On September 27, Congressman Juan Carlos Miguel Mendoza reported that he and other members of Fujimori's electoral alliance, Peru 2000, were pressured to resign and form a pro-Montesinos group """"to promote disorder and chaos"""" in the country, and create conditions for a military coup to re-install Montesinos. The most disturbing element of this denunciation was that the resignations were said to have been prepared in army headquarters.   Mr. Secretary General, instead of seeking to establish favorable conditions for Montesinos in Panama, the OAS and its member states should be seeking his immediate arrest, together with the retirement of the officers appointed by him to the armed forces command. Until the criminal clique that currently hold a gun to Peruvian democracy is removed from power and prosecuted for its crimes, the reform process on which the OAS and Peruvian democrats are embarked has little chance of success.   I strongly urge you, therefore, to take no further actions that would contribute to the impunity so far enjoyed by Montesinos and other government officials responsible for grave human rights violations. Instead, I believe that your Windsor resolution mandate requires you to press for their arrest and prosecution.

Mr. Rahami is a prominent lawyer who defended the former minister of the Interior, Abdullah Nouri, as well as 400 students attacked by Tehran police and extremists during peaceful protests for press freedom in July 1999. Ms. Ebadi is well known for her work on children's and women's rights. """"This prosecution punishes these lawyers because they are prominent human rights activists,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. Moreover, the two lawyers and Mr. Ebrahimi were not allowed a fair trial in accordance with either Iranian or international law. All the defendants were held for weeks in pre-trial detention without access to legal counsel. Mr. Ebrahimi did not have access to legal counsel until the final two hearings in the case and the court did not examine the validity of Ebrahimi's allegations.  The political nature of the trial appeared to be underscored by the publication of the verdict in government controlled media before the defendants or their legal representatives were informed.  Human Rights Watch is calling for the convictions against the defendants to be dismissed. The two lawyers should be permitted to resume their practices and Mr. Ebrahimi should be released from prison. If there is evidence of the involvement of any of the defendants in criminal activities then they should be charged and given a fair, public trial in accordance with international standards.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran",""

The former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service (Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional, SIN), arrived in Panama on Saturday night. The organization also called on the Panamanian justice authorities to investigate and prosecute Montesinos for grave violations of human rights, consistent with Panama's obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture. To claim victim status for Montesinos is nothing short of a farce,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division.  In its letter, Human Rights Watch pointed out that granting refuge to a public official credibly alleged to have committed grave violations of human rights in his country would contravene basic principles of asylum law, which expressly refuse the right of asylum to human rights violators. Indeed, under the Convention against Torture, to which Panama is a party, rather than extend its protection to such persons, the country is required to prosecute or extradite torturers found on its territory.  Montesinos has been alleged to be responsible for planning kidnappings and murders carried out by the Colina group, a death squad belonging to the SIN. Eight death squad members, who had been convicted and imprisoned for the abduction and murder of nine students and a teacher from La Cantuta university, were unconditionally released under a government amnesty in 1995. Montesinos may also be implicated in the torture in 1997 of former Army Intelligence agent Leonor la Rosa Bustamante, the torture and murder of fellow-agent Mariela Lucy Barreto Riofano, and the torture of journalist Fabian Salazar in May 2000. Each of these crimes was committed against people suspected of leaking information to the press about the SIN's illegal activities. There has been no action in Peruvian courts against Montesinos for any of the crimes for which he is believed responsible, due in large part to the SIN's wide-ranging influence over the judiciary. A charge for corruption of a public official following last week's video scandal is expected to be dropped soon.  Human Rights Watch strongly criticised the United States government and the Organization of American States for putting pressure on Panama to receive Montesinos, after it had initially refused to do so. """"In the long run, granting a safe haven to Montesinos will only reinforce impunity for human right violations in Peru,"""" said Vivanco.

When Burundi women fled the internal conflict there, they expected to find safety and protection in the refugee camps. Instead, they simply escaped one type of violence in Burundi to face other forms of abuse in the refugee camps in Tanzania,"""" said Chirumbidzo Mabuwa, author of the report and researcher for the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. The 151-page report, """"Seeking Protection: Addressing Sexual and Domestic Violence in Tanzania's Refugee Camps,"""" documents unhcr's and the Tanzanian host government's failure to address violence against women refugees in a timely and effective manner, despite ample evidence that women's lives were in danger in their homes and in the general camp community. It was not until 1999, five years after the establishment of the refugee camps in Tanzania, that unhcr began to address these problems systematically, under pressure from the refugees themselves and after the intervention of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch. unhcr was also helped by its receipt of special funds from a U.S.-based philanthropic organization in October 1998 to support programs to combat violence against refugee women in Tanzania and other sub-Saharan African countries. """"Important lessons must be learned from the mistakes in Tanzania,"""" said Mabuwa. """"unhcr and host governments must be proactive in assessing the protection needs of refugee women from the very start of refugee emergencies—they simply cannot wait until the problems reach crisis level.""""  Together with its implementing partners, unhcr has now initiated programs in the Tanzanian camps. These programs, among other things, raise community awareness about sexual and other gender-based violence and provide counseling for victims of sexual and domestic violence. """"While we commend the steps that unhcr is now taking to address violence against women in the camps, there are still critical gaps in its programs,"""" said Mabuwa. """"There is a dearth of consistent monitoring, the follow-up to cases is ad-hoc, and unhcr staff roles are still ill-defined.""""  """"The absence of an appropriate policy guiding unhcr staff on how to respond to domestic violence in refugee camps remains a serious problem that has far reaching consequences beyond Tanzania,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, one of the field investigators and deputy director of the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. At present, the only advice unhcr's guidelines offer its staff is virtually to ignore cases of domestic violence.""""  Human Rights Watch also criticized the Tanzanian government for its slow response and ineffective efforts to protect women from sexual and domestic violence. As a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which it ratified in 1983, Tanzania is obliged to ensure that its national laws and courts are accessible to refugees. It also has international legal obligations to guarantee women receive equal protection under the law by, among other things, ensuring that police and court officials investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence against refugee women. """"We acknowledge that for decades the Tanzanian government has generously opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees from across sub-Saharan Africa, taxing its own limited resources and infrastructure. However, its international legal obligations require it to provide these refugee women with better access to justice than they now have,"""" added Mabuwa. Despite the existence of laws punishing rape and assault, Tanzanian authorities lack the training, guidance, and resources to enforce those laws. On the one hand, police bias against victims of domestic violence makes it difficult for perpetrators to be held accountable. On the other hand, the courts in the Kibondo, Kasulu, Ngara, and Kigoma districts, where most refugee camps are located, are staffed by personnel who receive no training on how to investigate and adjudicate cases of violence against women.  """"Tanzania's poor record on ensuring that the justice system protects refugee women victims of violence is not exclusively a matter of resources, but also a question of political will,"""" said Mabuwa. """"Tanzanian authorities should not be allowed to hide their inaction behind the already well-acknowledged problem of insufficient resources. """" Tanzanian police officers interviewed by Human Rights Watch did not regard domestic violence as a crime. Rather than investigate reports of domestic violence, typically police simply referred the victims to unhcr and other organizations for counseling.  Human Rights Watch called for unhcr to ensure that its own guidelines and policies on protecting refugee women from violence are fully implemented and to adopt and implement a policy advising staff on how to intervene in cases of domestic violence. The international monitoring organization also urged the Tanzanian government to ensure that police adequately investigate and prosecute crimes of sexual and domestic violence against refugee women and to discipline police and judicial officials who fail to do so.

""""Abductions, torture, and unlawful killings are taking place on a daily basis throughout Aceh. Civilian authority has all but collapsed, and no one in Jakarta seems to be paying serious attention to human rights issues there,"""" the two organizations said. """"Indonesia's financial donors already have the problems in West Timor on the agenda for their annual meeting in October; they urgently need to add Aceh."""" The two leading international human rights monitoring organizations called for the immediate suspension from duty of any member of the police or military, including commanders, suspected of involvement in, tolerating, or condoning human rights violations. They also called for the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry, comprised of human rights experts, to investigate recent violations and for suspects to be brought to justice in trials which meet international standards for fairness. There has been a notable increase in the targeting of human rights defenders, humanitarian workers, and political activists in recent weeks -- the Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) in particular have been implicated in many of the latest violations. Since May, the Indonesian Government and the armed opposition group, the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM), have committed to protecting humanitarian workers under the terms of a ceasefire known as the """"humanitarian pause"""" but attacks on civilians have continued. The agreement was extended on 24 September to run until 15 January 2001. """"Extending the ceasefire agreement with the GAM means little if no one in the Wahid government can prevent Indonesian security forces from torturing and killing ordinary civilians"""" the organizations said. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch noted that frequent attacks by the armed opposition group on Indonesian military and police targets did present legitimate security concerns for the government, but the response of the security forces was counterproductive. """"Protecting human rights is an essential prerequisite to finding a durable solution to the conflict in Aceh. The targeting of respected civilians is only going to intensify resentment of central government rule and increase instability,"""" concluded Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Recent violations in which Brimob involvement has been reported include: On 19 September, two student activists with Sira, a group that advocates a referendum on Aceh's political status, were beaten with rifle butts, cable, and belts and threatened with knives by members of Brimob after being seized at gunpoint in Banda Aceh. On 16 September, respected academic Dr. Safwan Idris, rector of the Ar-raniry State Islamic Institute (IAIN) in Banda Aceh, was assassinated at his home. Dr. Safwan Idris had been an advocate of a non-violent resolution to the conflict in Aceh and was a candidate for governor. The motorcycle used by the gunmen was reported to have been seen entering a Brimob complex. On 27 August, three staff of Oxfam working in South Aceh were hospitalised after being tortured by Brimob officers. All three were beaten. One had a fingernail pulled out and was burned with cigarettes.According to government statistics, 40 civilians and 21 members of the security forces have been killed since the """"humanitarian pause"""" went into effect in early June. Figures on civilian deaths from non-government organizations are much higher. The two organizations urged both sides to uphold their commitments to protect humanitarian workers and to extend this comitment to ensure human rights protection for all civilians in Aceh. Background The annual meeting of the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), a donor group convened by the World Bank, is scheduled to take place in Tokyo on 18 and 19 October 2000. The World Bank President, James Wolfensohn, has warned Indonesia to bring pro-Indonesian militia operating in West Timor under control before the meeting. The warning follows the killing of three international staff at the offices of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Atambua, West Timor by militia in early September. All repatriation and humanitarian operatations for over 100,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor have been suspended since the killings.","Asia, Indonesia",""

On September 25, a military tribunal is scheduled to hear the case of Ziad Mugraby, the general manager of the ISP """"Destination"""" and Kamal el-Batal, executive director of the Lebanese nongovernmental human rights organization MIRSAD, which publicized the harrassment of the ISP. The case originated in April 2000, when police attempted to pressure people working at Destination, including Mr. Mugraby, to reveal the names of individuals involved with the Web site gaylebanon.com. MIRSAD documented and publicized internationally the harassment of the ISP. In one communique the organization """"deplore[d] the blatant and unlawful attempts by the police to interfere in the freedom of the Internet as well as the freedom of expression of the gay community,"""" and noted that """"expressing opinions on behalf of the gay community is protected under the Lebanese constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""""  On August 5, the military prosecutor charged Batal and Mugraby with violating Article 157 of the military penal code for """"tarnishing the reputation of the police des moeurs by distributing a printed flyer,"""" namely one of the MIRSAD communiques issued on behalf of Destination. The men face three months to three years imprisonment if found guilty.  Human Rights Watch said it was deeply concerned by Lebanon's latest attempt to prosecute civilians for exercising the internationally guaranteed right to freedom of expression.  """"This reflects increasing intolerance by the government,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Access to the Internet is an integral part of the right to free expression. And Internet service providers such as Destination should not be liable for Internet content.""""  Megally also criticized the criminal prosecution of Batal and Mugraby in the military court.  """"Civilians should never be tried in military courts, which lack the fuller independence of the civilian judiciary,"""" said Megally. """"The fact that this case involves peaceful freedom of expression -- of the gay community and of a human rights organization defending free expression -- only makes this prosecution more egregious.""""  The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission joined Human Rights Watch in condemning the prosecution as a threat directed at all human rights defenders in Lebanon: """"As part of a broader campaign to increase its censorship and control over the Internet, the Lebanese government has targeted a vulnerable and unpopular group, lesbians and gays, but the prosecution of Mr. el Batal and Mr. Mugraby shows that everyone's rights are at stake and no one should stand by idly,"""" said Kamal Fizazi, Regional Program Officer for Africa and Southwest Asia.  """"Prosecuting Kamal el Batal for criticizing police harrassment and interference with free expression sends a message that no critic of the authorities is safe,"""" Fizazi continued, noting that while Lebanon has always prided itself as being tolerant of and celebrating diversity and freedom of expression, with this action Lebanese authorities are stifling both.  Background:  The case against Batal and Mugraby began on April 3, 2000. According to a communique issued by MIRSAD on April 13, two police officers from the vice squad, who were wearing plain clothes, entered the offices of Destination on April 3. They did not have a search warrant but were carrying written instructions from superiors to identify the owners of a specific Internet address with content related to the Lebanese gay community. According to MIRSAD, the employees of Destination """"were harassed and were ordered not to make any outgoing phone calls during the visit. After interrogating Destination's technical personnel they confiscated the personal ID of a senior staff member and ordered him to appear at their office at the Hobaich Police station...the next day for further interrogation.""""  A lawyer for Destination later learned from the colonel who heads the vice squad that the colonel believed the ISP was """"broadcasting"""" immoral films. The lawyer explained to the colonel that ISPs did not """"broadcast"""" and that users were able to navigate the Web freely.  The next day, a senior staff member of Destination, accompanied by one of Destination's lawyers, visited the Hobaich Police Station. According to MIRSAD's report: """"One of the officers who entered Destination's offices, a captain, interrogated the staffer further. Part of the interrogation was conducted in a rude manner and without permitting the lawyer to sit in. It turned out that the particular Web site pursued by the police belonged to a non-resident group and [was] hosted in the United States. Destination had nothing to do with the site that offended the police.""""  MIRSAD further reported in a communique dated April 18 that the previous day Ziad Mugraby was summoned to the vice squad headquarters at the Hobaich police station. Police said that they were carrying out instructions from Beirut prosecutor Joseph Maamari to collect information for prosecution of the person or persons who financed or installed the Web site gaylebanon.com. Mugraby was threatened with closure of Destination unless he provided the information.  MIRSAD on April 18 also expressed its concern about a wider censorship campaign, and noted that a new Internet backbone might be based in Damascus, Syria, so that all Lebanese Internet connections and traffic would be routed through Syria.  There were no further developments until July 21, when MIRSAD's director, Kamal el Batal, was summoned for questioning at the Hobaich Police Station. He was asked about the communiques the organization had issued in April on behalf of Destination and freedom of expression, and about MIRSAD's investigative methodology and sources of information. In another communique, issued the same day, Batal reported what had happened, clarified the role of MIRSAD as a human rights organization, and noted """"the positive attitude of the interrogating officers.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Lebanon","LGBT Rights, Free Speech"

Attorney General Republic of Indonesia Dear Attorney General Marzuki, We write this open letter on behalf of the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch to express our sorrow and grave concern over the murder of Prof. Safwan Idris, rector of Ar Raniry State Institute of Islamic Studies (IAIN) in Banda Aceh. We urge an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of the crime, and prosecution of those responsible.  Prof. Idris was a dedicated scholar and administrator who worked to make IAIN an open and independent center not only for scholarship but also for fostering peaceful solutions to the conflict in Aceh. He was also an engaged citizen, serving on the Independent Investigation Commission set up by the government of President Habibie to investigate past military atrocities and other gross human rights violations in Aceh. At the time he was murdered, he was a strong candidate for Aceh's governship.  Under Prof. Idris, IAIN was a center of discourse and civil activity for a number of nongovernmental groups, including the Aceh Referendum Information Center (SIRA), a student organization that supports a referendum on Aceh's political future. His death is likely to discourage Aceh's students from peaceful participation in the political process and to weaken calls for a nonviolent resolution of Aceh's problems. Prof. Idris' assassination at his own home is all the more disturbing because it is part of an ongoing pattern of attacks on Acehnese civil society leaders, including the recent abduction and brutal murder in Medan of Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, a leading Acehnese human rights advocate. In January, Nasharuddin Daud, a member of Indonesia's national parliament, was killed under similar circumstances. While it remains unclear who was responsible for these murders and the string of abductions and assassinations in Aceh over the past two years, we are especially alarmed by unconfirmed reports that Prof. Idris' assailants have links to Mobile Brigade (Brimob) police forces based in Banda Aceh.  While preparing this letter, we were further disturbed to learn of the illegal detention and torture on September 19 of two student members of SIRA. The students, Muzakir and Mohamed Saleh, reportedly were seized by plainclothes police officers and and held for fifteen hours. We understand that they were beaten so severely while in custody that they required treatment at Zainal Abidin hospital upon their release.  We urge you to take concrete action to end such attacks on academics, students, and other civil society leaders in Aceh. There can be no lasting solution to the conflict in Aceh if individuals are not able to engage in an open exchange of ideas about their own society without fear of violent reprisals. An important first step would be an immediate, thorough, and objective inquiry into the murder of Prof. Idris and the earliest possible prosecution of the perpetrators. Thank you for your consideration of this urgent and important matter. We look forward to your reply.

The Burmese military government apparently believes it can suppress the NLD without paying any price internationally,"""" said Asia Division Washington Director Mike Jendrzejczyk. """"It's time for concerted action by the U.N., ASEAN, and others. Diplomatic appeals alone are not enough."""" Human Rights Watch urged the following specific measures:  Razali Ismail, the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Envoy for Burma, scheduled to visit Burma from October 6-8, should publicly call for immediate and permanent lifting of restrictions on the NLD and an end to the harassment of NLD party activists.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Burma is a member, should make clear to Burma that its actions risk disrupting ASEAN's relations with key aid and trading partners. ASEAN leaders have defended the 1997 decision to grant membership to Burma on the ground that engagement would induce reform in Burma. ASEAN leaders should use their influence to insist on immediate lifting of restrictions on the NLD and respect for basic rights.  The European Union (EU) should immediately announce that it will not be able to proceed with plans for an EU-ASEAN summit in Laos in December if the restrictions are not lifted and if Burmese officials responsible for the recent crackdown are on the summit invitation list.  Japan and Australia should put on hold planned workshops with the Burmese government until restrictions on the NLD are lifted. The first Japanese joint economic reform seminar took place in Rangoon in June. The next meeting of the Australian human rights workshops, aimed at creating a national human rights commission, are currently set for October. On the afternoon of September 21, Aung San Suu Kyi, Tin Oo, and eight NLD youth members attempted to board a train bound for the northern city of Mandalay, but were told that tickets were """"sold out."""" The group waited on the platform for subsequent trains, but officials from the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) government did not permit them to board any outbound trains. Early on the morning of September 22, authorities forcibly returned Aung San Suu Kyi to her home and placed her under house arrest. The government has said Tin Oo and the eight NLD youth reportedly are being held in a """"government guesthouse.""""  On Thursday, police reportedly rounded up some 100 NLD supporters who had gathered at the station in support of the group. Their whereabouts are also unknown but they are believed to be in police custody.  This is the second attempt in recent weeks by Aung San Suu Kyi, Tin Oo, and other NLD members to travel outside of the capital. On August 24, they tried to visit Kungyangon Township to organize the NLD youth wing there, but were forced off the road in the town of Dala on the outskirts of Rangoon. After a nine day standoff, the group was physically forced back to the capital on September 2. The NLD leaders, who have been held under house arrest off and on for years, were again put under house arrest. The restrictions were removed twelve days later following an international outcry.  Authorities reportedly detained eleven other senior NLD officers on September 13 and 14 on unknown charges. The ruling SPDC continues to hold over 1000 political prisoners, including members of ethnic minority groups.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

In recent years, the Bank has increasingly emphasized the importance of issues such as the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, transparency, and governance. In a question put to Mr. Wolfensohn at the ngo meeting, an FIDH representative acknowledged this trend, but questioned the absence to date of any explicit reference to binding international human rights treaties. In response, Mr. Wolfensohn mentioned collaboration with Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and promised that he would work with Bank staff to include human rights in their policy documents, and that the next time he meets with NGOs, they would see the product of this effort. HRW and FIDH cautioned that in order to make this commitment effective, the Bank needs to make use of international human rights texts – a step that Mr Wolfensohn did not specifically mention. The organizations argued that World Bank and IMF operations should be consistent with international human rights law, to which their shareholder states have committed themselves in ratifying legally binding international human rights treaties. HRW and FIDH further recommended that in order to operationalize this commitment, the Bank should take the following steps:  - Incorporate human rights standards among conditionality requirements - Develop internal Bank staff capacity to assess compliance with international human rights conventions and covenants, including in connection with Bank evaluation processes. - Integrate reference to human rights law in Bank policies and programs - Strengthen Bank collaboration and coordination with UN agencies that have related mandates (UNDP, WHO, UNCTAD, UNHCR…), and in particular with UN and regional human rights bodies. HRW and FIDH endorsed Mr Wolfensohn`s statement this morning about development and the fight against poverty: “it is all about rights”. But the organizations underscored their expectation of prompt and thorough practical implementation of this vision. “Existing international human rights law offers the only comprehensive framework for doing this,” stated FIDH´s Christine Habbard.","Global",""

According to the 227-page report, """"Owed Justice: Thai Women Trafficked into Debt Bondage in Japan,"""" the women are typically promised lucrative jobs by traffickers in Thailand, but arrive in Japan to find themselves trapped in """"debt."""" To repay these exorbitant sums - usually US$25,000 to US$40,000 - they must work for months, or even years, without pay, under highly coercive and abusive conditions. Japanese officials have publicly expressed their concern for the victims of trafficking. But over the course of a six-year investigation in both Japan and Thailand, Human Rights Watch found that the Japanese government has taken no concrete steps to stamp out the practice. """"If the Japanese government is so 'concerned' about the problem, it should do something for the victims instead of just talking about it,"""" said Regan Ralph, Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is high time to stop the rhetoric and start some serious law enforcement."""" The report says that employers decide when a debt is paid, and until then, they control the women's movements both on and off the job. Some women told Human Rights Watch researchers that they had been """"sold like cattle"""" and described video cameras and motion-sensitive lights that monitored their movements at work and at home. In most cases, trafficked women are compelled to work off their alleged debts as bar """"hostesses"""" who accompany clients to nearby hotels to perform sexual services. Given the coercive conditions of their employment, the women cannot refuse clients who are physically abusive, nor can they negotiate safer sex or get access to medical care without their employers' permission. The report says that some women were also beaten by their employers for """"disobeying"""" orders. Some women escape, but most endure these hardships until their employers release them. Most of them do not speak Japanese. They have had their passports confiscated by their employers, and have been threatened with violence if they try to flee. """"It's not hard to see why these women are reluctant to seek assistance from authorities,"""" said Ralph. """"They know that as 'illegal aliens' and 'prostitutes,' the best treatment they can hope for is summary deportation, while authorities turn a blind eye toward the abuses they've suffered at the hands of their traffickers."""" The Thai government has undertaken significant efforts to prevent trafficking and provide services to victims. But the Human Rights Watch report says that the enforcement of Thai laws and policies against trafficking has been weak, and, in some cases, has resulted in violations of women's right to freedom of movement and travel. The assistance for victims does not include any effort to facilitate trafficked women's access to justice in Japan. And while the Thai government helps repatriate women who can demonstrate Thai citizenship, other women are left stranded in Japan, living in legal limbo and separated indefinitely from their families and friends. The report notes that both the Japanese and Thai governments are participating in the drafting of a United Nations anti-trafficking protocol that will influence governments' response to trafficking in persons worldwide. Key provisions that will determine the nature of that response remain under dispute. The negotiations resume next month, and Human Rights Watch calls on the Japanese and Thai governments, as well as all other participating states, to ensure that the protocol includes strong provisions for the protection of the human rights and physical safety of trafficking victims.","Asia, Japan, Thailand","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Domestic Workers, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

A letter signed by Dr. Yolanda Moses, president of the American Association for Higher Education and co-chair of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee, urged the Indonesian government to investigate this crime immediately and thoroughly.  """"It seems as though no one is safe in Aceh now,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, director of the Academic Freedom Program at Human Rights Watch. """"If the Indonesian government doesn't investigate his murder, that will send a dangerous signal that Jakarta is not committed to a peaceful solution in Aceh.""""  Prof. Idris was a prominent member of civil society in Aceh, Indonesia's restive northern province. He served on the Independent Investigation Commission set up by the Indonesian government to investigate past military atrocities and other gross human rights violations in Aceh. He was also a leading candidate for Aceh's governorship.  Unconfirmed reports suggest that Prof. Idris' assailants may have been associated with the Brimob (Mobile Brigade) police forces in Banda Aceh.

In a separate letter to the U.N.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a report last week to the Security Council on the current phase of the oil-for-food program, said that Iraq had refused to issue visas to experts he had selected to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the humanitarian consequences of the sanctions. He also wrote that the government refused to discuss with the U.N. how a """"cash component"""" to the oil-for-food program could allow U.N.-controlled funds to be used to purchase locally produced goods and services.  The same report frequently cited serious problems stemming from protracted holds by the Security Council's sanctions committee on key infrastructure repair items affecting public health. The report underscored the fact that humanitarian relief, no matter how significant, cannot address the overall impoverishment of ordinary people, and noted that many Iraqi families lack the income to purchase basic goods, including fruits, vegetables, and meat products that are available on the market.

The Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), convened by the World Bank, is planning to meet in Tokyo in late October to determine aid commitments for the coming year. The CGI includes both bilateral donors such as the European Union, Japan, the U.S. and Canada, as well as multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank. Donors should set very specific conditions and tell the Indonesian government that the donor meeting will not be scheduled until those conditions are met,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. The donors should also agree on a verification mechanism to ensure compliance with the conditions before scheduling the CGI meeting, she said. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political, Social, and Security Affairs, told the U.N. Security Council yesterday that the government would give militia members until September 24 to voluntarily give up their weapons and thereafter would forcibly disarm them. Such verbal commitments have been made repeatedly over the past year and have not resulted in meaningful improvements in security.  """"We've had enough promises,"""" said Jones. """"Now we want results.""""  Human Rights Watch said the donor conditions should include the following:  Immediate formation of an independent fact-finding team, with international representation, to investigate the murders of humanitarian workers, local villagers, and a militia leader on September 5 and 6, 2000. The Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights has recommended such an investigation as an alternative to the army-police investigation now underway. The team should have clear and public terms of reference, including full and secure access to refugee camps and local detention facilities. Its members should also include Indonesian non-governmental organizations experienced in investigations in the area, as well as other outside experts as appropriate.  Clear steps toward disarming and disbanding the militia in a way that does not simply export the thuggery to another location. The suggestion that all militias move to a separate island is not a useful solution, as it leaves the militia organization and leadership intact, punishes no one, and gives known criminals a new base of operations. This has to be a serious program; it cannot be a repeat of the symbolic turnover by militias of a few handmade or out-of-date weapons that took place periodically during the run-up to the U.N.-supervised vote in East Timor last year, and Indonesian authorities cannot rely on militia forces to be forthcoming about what weapons they have and where they are.  Credible security guarantees for humanitarian workers in West Timor. Meaningful progress in resolving the crisis requires the return of a full complement of both local and international aid workers, but this cannot happen until conditions are secure. Nothing the Indonesian armed forces have said or done since early 1999 suggests they can be relied on to provide the necessary security. One alternative is the extension of the UNTAET mandate to cover protection for U.N. workers in West Timor, but such a solution would have to take place with Indonesia's acquiescence.  Separation of armed combatants from refugees in the camps and creation of conditions such that refugees are absolutely assured of their right to choose without fear or intimidation whether to return to East Timor or resettle elsewhere. These are necessary preconditions to the earliest possible closure of the camps.  Formal indictments and arrests by the Indonesian police of the nineteen men included on the list of suspects issued by the Indonesian attorney general on September 1, 2000, all of whom are believed to have been key perpetrators of the 1999 East Timor violence.  Beginning of trials in the cases of the nineteen, and steps to ensure that Indonesian prosecutions for the 1999 crimes do not end with this first group of suspects. Getting trials underway is essential to show the militias that there is indeed some threat of prosecution, perhaps deterring further violence. It would also show the East Timorese that justice through the court system is an attainable goal and would give the international community a chance to assess whether the Indonesian justice system is capable of holding anyone accountable for grave human rights violations in East Timor.  Systematic prosecution of all officers and militia leaders against whom there is sufficient prima facie evidence of criminal wrongdoing in East or West Timor to warrant an arrest. At a minimum, Indonesian justice officials should move to build prosecutable cases against army, police, and militia members named in the January 31, 2000 report by the Indonesian Commission of Inquiry on East Timor.  Full cooperation by the Indonesian government with a proposed delegation from the U.N. Security Council. That delegation should complete its visit to Indonesia prior to the donor meeting and should have a clear mandate to verify Indonesia's compliance with the terms of Security Council Resolution 1319, adopted on September 8, 2000, calling for """"immediate and effective action"""" to resolve the ongoing crisis in West Timor.","Asia, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

In Kinshasa, Minister of Information Dominique Sakombi banned ten private and church-owned radio and television stations, publicly blaming them for their """"failure"""" to abide by a set of instructions that unilaterally define the contents of their programs. The banned stations are Radio Elikya (owned by the Catholic Church), Radio Réveil FM, Radio Malebo Broadcast Channel (MBC), Radio RTKM, Radio Sentinelle (of the independent Church Cité Bethel), Radio Kintuadi (property of the Kimbanguiste Church), Antenne A Télévision, Canal Kin 1 and Canal Kin 2 (owned by Jean Bemba Saolona, a leading businessman and former minister of national economy), and TKM television station. In July 1999, the Ministry of Information prohibited private stations from relaying international news bulletins, until then a common practice in the Congo.

The court on the same day also sentenced Richard Nsamba Olangi, publisher of 'Le Messager Africain', and journalist Nicolas Katako to one year's imprisonment, with six months suspended. COM found the four journalists guilty of """"high treason"""" and """"publication of articles hostile to the government.""""  Sentenced by COM to three years imprisonment since May 2000, another journalist, Freddy Loseke Lisumbu la Yayenga, editor of the newspaper La Libre Afrique (Free Africa), is reported to be seriously ill. His condition requires immediate medical attention. Human Rights Watch calls for the immediate release of all five journalists.  In Bukavu, the capital of rebel held south Kivu province, Jean Pierre Tanganyika, also known as Dudjo, who is a photographer, was arrested after a grenade explosion on 26 August for having taken pictures of the injured victims at the scene. He was detained without formal charge at the local army barracks, briefly released on Saturday September 16, and rearrested again on the same day. His current whereabouts remain unknown.  There appears to be some disagreement in the RCD over the reopening of Radio Mandaeleo which was suspended last year by order of the RCD Department of Information, Press, and Cultural Affairs. Until it was silenced, Mandaeleo, (Swahili for development), was an independent, nonprofit radio station in South Kivu that produced news as well as programs on development, human rights, and other subjects, much of it provided by local NGOs. The RCD authorities formally suspended it on July 30, 1999 after the station ignored for weeks RCD directives not to air its own political news and debates and to relay instead those provided by the official rebel radio. Human Rights Watch appealed to RCD authorities to re-open Radio Mandaeleo, and thus make a huge step forward for free expression and debate in eastern DRC.  On September 14, the authorities of the rebellion allowed Mgr. Emmanuel Kataliko, Bishop of Bukavu, to return to the city after almost seven months of internal exile which were marked by constant pressures from the local population and the international community for his return. The RCD authorities still have to authorize the return of four leading civil society activists who were detained and banished to the distant city of Kisangani on August 29.

The Peruvian president's decision was announced shortly after it was revealed that intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos had bribed an opposition congressman. Fujimori's decision to call new elections was correct, but for these elections to be seen as fair and credible, they should not take place under his presidency,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.

The bribery scandal came in the wake of one of the most widely questioned elections the region has seen for decades. It raised suspicions that President Fujimori (elected in May after opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo withdrew alleging fraud) had secured a parliamentary majority by bribing opposition congressmen to change sides.  The New York-based human rights organization also expressed concern for the safety of politicians who made public the video incriminating Montesinos, several of whom have received death threats. Vivanco said that Montesinos should be separated immediately from his control of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), and prosecuted for the crimes he committed as the head of the SIN. """"Fujimori has promised to ‘deactivate' the SIN, but it is absurd to propose this with Montesinos still in control,"""" said Vivanco. Human Rights Watch pointed out that a thorough and impartial investigation of the bribery scandal would be unlikely unless measures are taken promptly to restore the independence of Peru's judicial system. Furthermore, the credibility of future elections would depend on restoring public confidence in Peru's electoral bodies and on measures to strengthen freedom of the press. Human Rights Watch praised the efforts of the OAS mission led by Eduardo Latorre in brokering electoral reforms.

""""The stakes could not be higher for Slobodan Milosevic,"""" said Rachel Denber, Acting Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government has transformed the election campaign into a siege against the opposition."""" Ms. Denber noted that as a war crimes indictee before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Milosevic needs a victory to lower the risk of being arrested and brought to trial.  During the September 24 elections Yugoslav citizens will simultaneously vote for a new president, federal parliament, and municipal assemblies. August polls indicate that only 20 to 25 percent of voters favor President Milosevic, with 35 to 40 percent supporting his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica.  The Yugoslav government utterly dominates the media, providing only meager access to the opposition. In a characteristic example, Politika, the main government-controlled newspaper, published an editorial calling leaders of the opposition """"well-fed dogs,"""" """"a hodge-podge of nothingness,"""" and """"the garbage to throw out.""""  Police have interrogated high-ranking opposition activists, prevented them from holding town meetings, and even beaten some low-profile opposition candidates for municipal assemblies. Some 250 members of Otpor, a student-led group of Milosevic's opponents, were detained at the end of August and beginning of September.  Pro-government parties dominate election commissions and polling boards, which conduct the elections. In the Federal Electoral Commission and district electoral commissions, the pro-government members outnumber opposition by six to one. All polling boards, which run the voting at polling stations, are dominated by members of Milosevic's coalition.  Yugoslav election law facilitates fraud. It bans comprehensive opposition vetting of the printing of ballots at the state-owned printing house, Politika. Watermarks on all ballots are identical, rather than specific to each polling station, which increases the possibility of the accumulation of ballots that are unaccounted for. There is no exhaustive list of voters' names and I.D. numbers, making it virtually impossible to identify persons registered in more than one polling station or election district. Voters do not countersign the voting register; instead, a polling board member simply circles the number next to the name of the voter casting his or her ballot, which facilitates ballot stuffing. Voting results are expressed only in digits, not in words; in well-documented cases during the 1996 and 1997 elections, digits were simply added to the numbers indicating the vote for the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, after the polling board had counted the votes.  According to reasonable accounts about 200,000 Kosovo non-Albanians are eligible voters. Serbian authorities are inflating the number to at least 350,000. Displaced persons and other Kosovo non-Albanians will vote at special polling stations throughout Serbia, apparently without the presence of the opposition at many of them. Voting by soldiers—whose number is estimated at between 100,000 and 300,000—remains under the exclusive discretion of the Yugoslav Army, and the opposition cannot vet for potential fraud.  Yugoslav authorities have turned down a request from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for monitoring of the September 24 elections. They also launched a vehement campaign against CESID, a well-trained and professional election-monitoring organization in Serbia, accusing it of being a NATO mouthpiece and carrying out police raids in CESID offices.

""""It is unacceptable that they should fall victim to similar atrocities in their place of refuge.""""   Human Rights Watch called on the Guinean government to immediately cease the round-ups and attacks against the refugees, and to investigate those responsible. The organization also called on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to investigate the attacks and protect refugees in Guinea. On September 12 UNHCR released a public statement acknowledging """"unconfirmed"""" reports of rape.   On Saturday, September 9, President Lansana Conté of Guinea made a public plea on radio and television to protect the country from rebel attacks from Sierra Leone and Liberia. Thousands of refugees in the capital, Conakry, were then attacked and rounded up by police, soldiers and armed civilian militias in response to Conté's address.   According to Human Rights Watch interviews, the mobs drove refugees out of their houses, frequently beating, raping, and sexually abusing them. The attackers wielded sticks, rocks, iron bars, electric cords and knives.   Police also arbitrarily detained an unknown number of refugees. UNHCR estimated that some 3,000 people were rounded up and taken into detention over the weekend. Most of them were taken initially to police stations and then moved to local district communes or schools in Conakry. Hundreds fled with their belongings to the Sierra Leonean embassy in Conakry for safety.   Human Rights Watch has confirmed at least one case of a man who died while in detention. Among the ten rape victims interviewed were a 14-year-old girl and a mother with a three-month-old baby.   Most of the refugees' houses were looted and their property stolen. Some refugees were strip-searched for money, including an elderly grandmother and a young mother with a ten-month-old baby. Victims and witnesses said Guinean police and army officers were present during some of the attacks, and sometimes participated. Most of the refugees Human Rights Watch interviewed were from Sierra Leone; seven were from Liberia.   UNHCR, the international refugee agency charged with providing protection to refugees, told Human Rights Watch it had not investigated any cases of rape so far, and said that it could not confirm the reports. Guinean officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch also denied that such abuses had taken place. Human Rights Watch made a strong plea to both UNHCR and the Guinean authorities to immediately investigate these abuses.   President Conté's statement accused the refugees of harboring rebels responsible for recent cross-border attacks into Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone, and declared that the refugees """"should go home."""" """"I am giving orders that we bring together all foreigners in [Guinean] neighborhoods, so that we know what they are doing, and that we search and arrest suspects,"""" he said. """"Civilians and soldiers, let's defend our country together. Crush the invaders.""""   Guinean authorities have reported three cross-border incursions into Guinea over the past week, the most serious occurring in the Guinean border town of Massadou where 47 people were killed after an incursion from Liberia on September 1. On September 8 the Guinean authorities reported that the border town of Pamelap was attacked by Sierra Leonean insurgents and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that between 20-40 soldiers and civilians had been injured. The attacks have resulted in rising hostility against Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees in camps along the two borders.   Guinea hosts one of the largest refugee populations in Africa. UNHCR estimates that there are 125,000 Liberian and 330,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea who have fled the brutal civil wars and gross human rights violations in both countries. An estimated 10,000 refugees have fled Sierra Leone since May 2000 when the fighting and atrocities by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) intensified once again. In the past, Guinea has been praised by the international community for its generous policies of sheltering refugees.   In recent months, however, Guinea has intermittently closed its border with Sierra Leone, in violation of its international commitments. Fearful of incursions by Sierra Leonean rebels, the Guinean authorities closed the border at the beginning of August, later agreeing to allow access only to """"vulnerable"""" refugees (including pregnant and lactating women; children below the age of 14 (later raised to 18); and the elderly). At the beginning of September UNHCR confirmed that at least 10,000 civilians were waiting to cross the border and one pregnant women and at least ten children had died due to the poor conditions.   The UNHCR representative in Guinea, Chrysantus Ache, told Human Rights Watch on Monday, September 11 that the government had issued instructions to release all the refugees and to stop the round-ups and harassment. Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch has documented that significant numbers of refugees remain in detention and that the rapes, attacks and harassment have not ended.  Excerpted Testimonies from Sierra Leonean Refugees in Conakry, Guinea Documented September 11 and 12, 2000  A 19-year-old woman told Human Rights Watch that three armed soldiers in camouflage and with red berets and a crowd of civilians broke into her house where she lived with her mother and nine brothers and sisters on Saturday night. She was carrying her three-month-old baby on her back when the soldiers entered the house. One of the soldiers pushed her hard and she fell on the TV, another soldier grabbed her baby from her back. The first soldier pushed her down and raped her. She cried, """"But I'm a brand new mother. I've just had a baby."""" When the soldier was finished, one of the civilians then raped her. Once they had raped her they beat her, scratched her arm and kicked her, calling her a """"bastard child."""" Then one of the soldiers gave a command to take everything from the house. They took the TV, the clothes, and the beds and loaded everything onto carts waiting outside. They took the baby as well. The woman's mother was hiding under one of the beds and they forced her at gunpoint to hand over her money. The mob stayed for more than three hours. """"All I could think of was my baby,"""" the woman told Human Rights Watch. """"After they'd left I gave my uncle a picture of my baby and they went from place to place until they found him. The soldiers had left him at one of the detention centers. They even stole his little clothes.""""   A mother told Human Rights Watch how her 14-year-old daughter - a twin - was raped in front of her. At 5 a.m. on Saturday. Five soldiers and many civilians banged on their door, crying """"Police, police... if you don't open we'll shoot you all."""" Afraid that they would be killed, the family opened the door and the mob rushed in. The soldiers pointed their guns at the family and shouted, """"You have dollars, pull the dollars or we'll kill you all."""" They stole all their possessions - fans, chairs, the freezer, audiotapes, clothes and shoes. One civilian from the neighborhood grabbed the woman's daughter shouting, """"You're the rebels, you're bringing the fighting to our country. We'll kill you."""" The woman tried to throw herself in front of the soldiers, but they kicked her aside, pulled her daughter away and started raping her. Another soldier grabbed the mother by her hair and forced her to watch as her daughter was raped by two soldiers and a civilian. The mother struggled to stop them but they beat her and pushed her six-year-old son aside - he fell and broke his tooth. """"After the rape my daughter was bleeding,"""" the mother told Human Rights Watch. """"We don't have anything. We're just trying to make ends meet here in Guinea. We've been here five years... we fled the violence in Kambia district (Sierra Leone). They even stole 350,000 francs guinea [about $200 US] - all I had saved for a long time.""""   A 19-year-old woman told Human Rights Watch how she was raped in her home on Monday night by four soldiers. She lived in Kobaya, a suburb five to six miles away from the center of Conakry, with four other family members. At 10 a.m. a crowd arrived at her house, some of them in uniform with green caps, and one police officer with a blue uniform and black cap. The gate was locked, so they jumped it and entered. There were 10 youths with them, who carried sticks, axes and machetes and used them to break into the house. As the woman was trying to run a soldier grabbed hold of her and slapped her once on the face; a few civilian youths held her by the shirt at her neck. The men found her two cousins and her sister and pushed them into a blue truck. They took their clothes, suitcases and other things and left the woman alone in the house. At 8 p.m. the mob came back. They banged at the door. The woman hid under the bed, but they got in and four of them - all in military dress - entered. She told Human Rights Watch, """"They pulled me out from under the bed and then used me just there one after the other. I begged them but they said they'd kill me. One of them sat on a chair with his gun and the other one used me - then they took their turn."""" When they had left she escaped to the Sierra Leonean embassy for safety.   A 24-year-old woman described to Human Rights Watch how she was raped by four soldiers in Seratay police station on September 10. The soldiers and gangs of youths came to her neighborhood on Sunday night. They were shouting, """"All Sierra Leoneans must come out."""" Her husband was away that night, so she came out with her two small children. The crowd searched her house and carried their fridge, suitcases, clothes and other things and loaded them onto a green military van. Then they took her and her children to Seratay police station where they were put in a cell with up to one hundred people. After a few hours the soldiers came and called a woman - they took her into a room and when she came back she was limping and said that they'd raped her. The woman explained to Human Rights Watch, """"Then they came for me. I said I can't go, I have my children, but one of the soldier men grabbed my 10-month-old baby out of my arms, flung him [aside] and ordered me inside a room. They used me on the ground. All four of them did it. They were all soldiers men in uniforms and two had two stripes - like they were the big men there. After they left me they took a few other women as well. I begged them but they said, """"Shut up... we'll kill you... our president has announced that all you people must leave. You're all rebels.""""   Other women also described sexual abuse and humiliation by soldiers and police officers. A 29-year-old woman told Human Rights Watch that she was arrested at 6 p.m. on Friday night by three soldiers and taken to Hamdalai police station and then to Rotoma commune. The soldiers called each one of them and wrote down their names. At noon on Saturday they called her into a small room. She told Human Rights Watch, """"I had my little baby in my arms. There were five or six of them. Then they grabbed my baby and flung him in the corner. He started screaming but they ordered me to strip off all my clothes. Then they told me to spread my legs and bend over and four of them put their fingers inside me saying that they were looking for money. After the fourth one I couldn't bear it and I said no more. So they kicked me with their soldier boots and hit me hard with the butts of their rifles.""""  Fuller Testimonies from Sierra Leonean Refugees in Conakry, Guinea  Cases of rape, sexual assault and humiliation   Woman, 19, raped and baby kidnapped:  """"Late on Saturday night, three armed soldiers... in camouflage and with red berets, and a lot of civilians broke into our house in two directions; some from the back and some through the front... I lived there with my mother and 9 brothers and sister. I just had a little baby which I had on my back when the soldiers entered. One of the soldiers pushed me hard and I fell onto the TV then another soldiers grabbed my baby off my back. """"Then the first soldier pushed me down and raped me... I cried, but I'm a brand new mother. I've just had a baby. Then one of the civilians raped me. They roughed me up and scraped me on my arm. They called me a bastard child and kicked me hard after using me...they said you people only like your Sierra Leones for boyfriends, don't you? Then I heard one of the soldiers give a command to take everything... so they started taking the TV, clothes and as they were taking apart one of the beds they found my mother hiding there... so they pushed her and forced her at gunpoint to give them money... she had about 250 US dollars hidden on her.

The civilians were with iron bars, knives, sticks... they started looting, they took the fans, chairs, freezers, tape, clothes, they opened all the boxes looking for the best of everything.

WASHINGTON -- Regardless of who wins the November election, the incoming administration will inherit some complex foreign policy dilemmas. China's emergence as a great power is one such challenge. How Al Gore or George W. Bush deals with China will help define their respective foreign policy priorities. How would each of them balance competing pressures for confrontation vs. dialogue to promote stable U.S.-China relations and long-term political change? Will human rights be an integral component, or merely a rhetorical commitment that takes a back seat to other interests? Since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, debate over China policy has split both the Republican and Democratic parties, driven by highly polarized images. Beijing is seen either as a ruthless Communist dictatorship that must be contained or as an authoritarian system in transition that can be a strategic partner with the United States. The Senate is to vote on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China later this week. But it will be left to the new White House to forge a consensus on how best to encourage China's evolution as a responsible member of the international community. The current """"engagement"""" approach is heavily dependent on trade and investment as a catalyst in the hope that economic reform will eventually lead to political reform. It's based on the assumption that a generational change under way in China will gradually erode the Communist Party's monopoly on power. Over time, connections to the Internet -- eagerly sought by the country's young people -- may become more useful for social advancement than contacts in the party. These assumptions may be correct. But the Clinton administration has failed to carry out a credible policy that uses both carrots and sticks to further China's political and economic development, while also supporting those taking risks and working for political change from within. China's prospective entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will certainly increase demands for greater transparency in matters of trade and investment. But WTO membership won't in itself lead to a more open, accountable form of governance. Consistent outside pressure is also needed. Jiang Zemin, China's president, has been heralded for his role as an economic reformer. Struggling to cope with rising unemployment, rampant corruption and widespread protests by unpaid workers and disgruntled farmers, he has pegged his survival on the ability to deliver continued economic growth. But Mr. Jiang has been equally determined to stamp out potential challenges to the party's rule. """"Any political behavior that is aimed at damaging the stability and unity of our country runs counter to the will and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people,"""" he proclaimed. The government should """"have a clear-cut stand in increasingly opposing them and firmly nipping them in bud."""" Thus, pro-democracy activists, religious believers outside the official churches, ethnic Tibetans, members of Falun Gong, and those trying to use the Internet to expose abuses, have all been suppressed. Some have been given heavy prison sentences or have been sent to """"re-education through labor"""" camps. The next U.S. president will need a vigorous bilateral policy, combined with serious attempts to reach out to China's other chief trading partners, including Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union. Crafting a multilateral approach is essential to help prevent Beijing from playing off one country against another, as it has done so effectively in the past, or dismissing U.S. protests as part of an American campaign of superpower domination. Here are some elements of China policy an incoming administration can embrace:  Support institutional reform. Provide funding for rule-of-law programs, such as training and exchanges of lawyers and judges, seminars in how to deal with labor-industrial relations and to apply international legal and labor norms. These are slow, incremental initiatives, but important nonetheless if the U.S. wishes to align itself with those inside China working for institutional change.  Don't overemphasize trade. Add teeth to the new bilateral human rights commission on China created by the PNTR legislation, by insisting that the commission's annual report to Congress trigger a debate and vote on specific policy recommendations. This is vital so that once China joins the WTO, the focus on getting compliance with its trade obligations doesn't marginalize human rights on the U.S.-China agenda.  Push business to be more pro-active. Lobby Congress to adopt a """"code of conduct"""" for American companies in China. It's time to take at face value the claims of U.S. businesses that they are """"sowing the seeds of democracy"""" by their presence in China and the treatment of their workers. A code spelling out """"best practices,"""" and providing for reports on its implementation, would give consumers confidence that corporations are doing more than paying lip service to core rights concerns.  Use summits to get results. High level summit meetings with China's leaders should be preceded by tough negotiations for concrete human rights progress. President Clinton was right to go to China in 1998, but his successor should make it clear that ratifying and implementing key U.N. human rights treaties China has signed must be part of the agenda if he is to travel there early in his term.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/09/12/memorandum-accountability-humanitarian-law-violations-chechnya","Memorandum on Accountability for Humanitarian Law Violations in Chechnya","Memorandum on Accountability for Humanitarian Law Violations in Chechnya","","09/12/2000","Human Rights Watch firmly believes that Russian domestic agencies have not established a meaningful accountability process, required by the United Nations, to bring to justice those responsible for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in the Chechnya war.  In September 1999, Russian forces began a military campaign to regain political control of Chechnya. A series of bombings in Russia, which the government blamed on Chechen forces, and the summer 1999 Chechen invasion of Dagestan sparked the armed conflict, the second in the past five years.  Both parties to the conflict committed serious abuses in a brutal war that is costing thousands of civilian lives, displacing tens of thousands of people, and causing serious damage to civilian homes and infrastructure. Chechen forces have violated humanitarian law by summarily executing servicemen they have captured, physically abusing civilians, and violating civilian immunity. But the overwhelming majority of abuse has been committed by Russian forces. They perpetrated three major massacres--in the village of Alkhan-Yurt (December 1999) and in the Staropromyslovski (January 2000) and Aldi (February 2000) districts of Grozny, Chechnya's capital--that cost at least 130 civilian lives; they have killed or maimed thousands of civilians through indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing; and they have rounded up and systematically tortured untold numbers of civilians suspected of collaborating with Chechen rebels. Human Rights Watch documented in detail these violations during field presence in Ingushetia from November 1999 through May 2000. Russian forces committed similar violations of international humanitarian law during the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya. Under pressure from the international community, the Russian government made a commitment to investigate these abuses and hold accountable their perpetrators. Four years later, it failed to live up to this commitment. It would be a tragic derogation of duty should the international community again fail to insist on a credible, impartial and transparent accountability process.  Governments and international organizations repeatedly called on Russia to halt and investigate the atrocities in the current war. On April 25, 2000 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution deploring abuses in Chechnya and calling on Russia to investigate them.  The April 25 resolution called on Russia to take specific action to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to cooperate with intergovernmental and nongovernmental agencies seeking to conduct their own inquiries. The Russian government rejected the resolution and refused to implement its chief requirements in a transparent manner. Five months after the resolution's adoption, Russia has made no meaningful progress toward establishing accountability for abuse. It has effectively denied access to the conflict zone for thematic rapporteurs but has, to its credit, permitted limited access to Council of Europe representatives. Below we discuss the inadequacy of the Russian response to key requirements specified by the Commission in the resolution. Calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to establish urgently, according to recognized international standards, a national, broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate promptly alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the Republic of Chechnya in order to establish the truth and identify those responsible, with a view to bringing them to justice and preventing impunity. (Resolution paragraph 4)  Russia has not created a national commission of inquiry nor has it, through law enforcement agencies or other special institutions, established accountability or prevented impunity. There are currently three bodies, in addition to regular law enforcement agencies, that are concerned with human rights issues in Chechnya: the Office of the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for Ensuring Human and Civil Rights and Freedoms in the Chechen Republic, headed by Vladimir Kalamanov; a purportedly independent commission headed by former Justice Minister Pavel Krashenninikov; and a State Duma commission headed by Alexander Tkachev. None of these agencies can be seen as meeting the international standards for independent commissions of inquiry. (A summary of such standards developed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights is attached.) At best, they are authorized to forward complaints about serious abuse to law enforcement agencies and request information about action taken. Their priorities, while laudable, do not lie in establishing the full truth about and accountability for some of the worst abuses in the war--summary executions and torture. They cannot, for example, subpoena evidence and witnesses, they do not submit evidence to prosecutorial authorities, and they do not appear to have the full cooperation of prosecutorial agencies.  President Vladimir Putin appointed Mr. Kalamanov in response to international outcry about atrocities and torture in Chechnya. Mr. Kalamanov has established an office in Znamenskoe, in northern Chechnya; to its credit, the office has been instrumental in securing the release of dozens of Chechen detainees in Russian custody and in restoring to hundreds of civilians identity documents that were lost, confiscated or destroyed. It also responds to individual complaints, prioritizing those that regard food, housing, pensions, identity papers, and compensation. Mr. Kalamanov's office has entered into a collaborative relationship with the Council of Europe, with three Council of Europe experts resident in his office in Znamenskoe, Chechnya; it also accepts technical assistance from the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Human Rights Watch values our dialogue with Mr. Kalamanov and his staff, and sincerely believes that his efforts are making a positive contribution. However, Mr. Kalamanov's office in no way can be considered a national commission of inquiry. While it has provided human rights organizations with useful information about procuracy investigations into abuses, it does not investigate complaints of abuse by Russian forces. Nor does it appear to have the authority to compel the procuracy to investigate meritorious cases. Moreover, it has chosen to prioritize other issues that are worthy, but that do not contribute to a meaningful accountability process.  The commission headed by Mr. Krashenninikov is an unregistered nongovernmental organization funded by private donors that has no investigatory authority or function. Its mandate includes the examination of human rights violations in the North Caucasus in the 1990s; other parts of its mandate and planned activities are highly laudable, but are unfortunately unrelated to accountability. These include lowering interethnic tensions in Russian society and maintaining contact with international and Russian organizations and NGOs engaged in the crisis in the North Caucasus. The commission receives complaints from individuals, which it forwards to the relevant government agencies. It plans to establish legal aid centers in Moscow, Chechnya, and other regions of Russia to broaden its information-gathering capacity, but lacks resources to do so.  Led by Alexander Tkachev, the State Duma Commission on Normalizing the Socio-Political Situation and Human Rights in Chechnya has sixteen members, nine of whom are resident in Chechnya, and an office in Gudermes. The commission is to be involved in useful initiatives to ensure funds for reconstruction and to reestablish the social welfare infrastructure. They forward complaints--on issues ranging from pensions, housing, and unemployment to abuse by law enforcement agencies--to the appropriate state agencies and request information about action on such complaints.  Human Rights Watch has advocated for an independent, international commission of inquiry because domestic investigative agencies have proven either incapable or unwilling to undertake rigorous, impartial investigations into atrocities in Chechnya or to prosecute their authors. The military procuracy(1) has closed its investigation into the Alkhan-Yurt massacre, claiming that it found """"no evidence of a crime."""" Notably, the procuracy limited its investigation to the period of time leading up to the Russian seizure of Alkhan-Yurt on December 2, 1999. Our research indicates that this was the date on which the abuses began. The military procuracy failed to open an investigation on Staropromyslovski; it transferred the investigation of Aldi to the civilian procuracy, claiming that servicemen under its jurisdiction were not involved in the sweep operation there. The civilian procuracy has opened a criminal case into the death of one civilian at Staropromyslovski (Human Rights Watch documented fifty-one civilian deaths in that massacre); it chose to refer us to the Grozny city procuracy to obtain information on the Alkhan Yurt, Aldi and Staropromyslovski investigations. If the procuracy general or any regional procuracy has undertaken an investigation into systematic torture of detainees at the infamous Chernokozovo detention center in January and early February, it has not made available any information on the progress of its efforts. In March 2000, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture requested the Russian authorities to carry out such an investigation within three months; it is entirely unknown whether the Russian government has complied with this mandatory request. Procuracy investigations lack transparency, an essential part of any credible accountability process. Occasionally the procuracy makes available figures on the number of cases under investigation in Chechnya, but leaves obscured the nature of the crimes under investigation, and whether they were perpetrated against civilians. According to Mr. Kalamanov, for example, the civilian procuracy has opened twenty criminal cases in reference to Alkhan Yurt, but the nature of the crimes under investigation is entirely unclear. Supports the requests made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for international involvement, and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to agree to the requests of those organizations to deploy staff in the region in line with their mandates. (Resolution paragraph 3)  As mentioned above, Russia has entered into a cooperative relationship with the Council of Europe through the latter's deployment of three experts to Mr. Kalamanov's office.(2) The Russian government has, however, stubbornly and persistently refused to allow the redeployment of the OSCE Assistance Group by objecting to its security requirements. The group has had a mandate to be present in the region since 1995. Its mandate was reaffirmed by all OSCE member states, including the Russian government, at the 1999 Istanbul OSCE summit. Urges the government of the Russian Federation to cooperate with the special mechanisms of the Commission [i.e., the Special Rapporteur on torture, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, the Special Representative of the Secretary General on internally displaced persons and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict] and, in particular to give favorable consideration to the requests already presented to undertake visits in the region as a matter of priority. (Resolution paragraph 8) As of this early September, the Russian government has not responded to requests filed by the special rapporteurs by issuing invitations to visit the region. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to a request, filed in April, by the special rapporteurs on torture and violence against women for an invitation to visit the region by noting that they were welcome, but stating that the visit could not take place at the time due to an allegedly unsatisfactory security situation. A subsequent request by the Special Rapporteur on torture remains unanswered. The ministry underscored that any visit would have to be unrelated to the CHR resolution. No invitations have been forthcoming for the other special rapporteurs or special representatives. Calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to give free and effective access in the Republic of Chechnya by international and regional organizations, in particular the ICRC, to all places of detention, . . . . (Resolution paragraph 10) Free and unfettered access to Chechnya is essential for organizations that seek to document human rights violations and press for accountability. To its credit, the government has consented to ICRC full access to all detention facilities under its control in Chechnya and in other regions of Russia where detainees are held in relation to the armed conflict. Access has improved for local humanitarian groups, journalists, and human rights groups. The government has not, however, responded positively to Human Rights Watch's many requests for access. The experience of nongovernmental actors operating in Chechnya belies the security concerns that have allegedly prevented deployment of the U.N. special mechanisms. Welcomes the invitation extended by the Government of the Russian Federation to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for a return visit in two to three months. (Resolution paragraph 12)  During the High Commissioner's April visit to Russia, which included three days in the North Caucasus, Foreign Minister Ivanov extended an oral invitation to the High Commissioner to return review progress in resolving many of the issues she had raised. No formal invitation from the ministry has been issued, however, in the five months since her visit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

The alternative is relying on the ten-person team composed entirely of Indonesian army and police set up on Friday by the provincial police command in West Timor.  """"There is a real danger of a cover up if this investigation is left to the same people who have let the militias run rampant for the last twelve months,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The question is not just who committed these savage murders -- it's who is responsible for the systematic intimidation of aid workers and refugees that escalated into outright murder.""""  Indonesian President Wahid has pointed to the detention of fifteen suspects in the attack on the Atambua office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and one suspect in the murder of militia leader Olivio Mendonca Moruk as evidence of a newfound will to act promptly in response to Wednesday's violence. """"Given the past record of local authorities in dealing with the militias, I think there will be skepticism about every aspect of this case unless respected outside investigators are part of a fact-finding team,"""" said Jones.  Human Rights Watch says a comprehensive policy is needed to protect the East Timorese in West Timor and the humanitarian workers who assist them. That policy would involve:  Immediate formation of a fact-finding team composed of the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission; an appropriate U.N. body such as UNHCR; Indonesian NGOs experienced in investigations in the area; and other outside experts or investigators as appropriate. The team should have clear and public terms of reference, including full and secure access to refugee camps and local detention facilities.  A thorough and immediate sweeping by the Indonesian army of known militia residences and camps in West Timor to search for and confiscate weapons.  Cooperation between Indonesian police and investigators from the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to arrest and detain all militia leaders against whom there is sufficient prima facie evidence to proceed with prosecutions under the Indonesian Criminal Code.  Immediate detention of the nineteen suspects named by the Attorney General's office on September 1 as suspected perpetrators of serious abuses. (This step was recommended Friday by the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights.)  Commitment to begin formal prosecutions in Jakarta and Dili of cases related to the 1999 militia violence in East Timor, which would serve three purposes. First, getting serious trials underway would show to the militias that there is indeed some threat of prosecution, perhaps deterring further violence. Second, it would show to the East Timorese that justice through the court system was an attainable goal. And third, it would give the international community a chance to assess whether the Indonesian justice system is capable of holding anyone accountable for grave human rights violations in East Timor.  Extension of the mandate of the UNTAET peacekeeping forces to provide protection for humanitarian workers in West Timor unless a credible alternative is found.  Establishment of a high-level international committee to work out the modalities of the transfer of refugee camps away from the border, and separation of armed combatants from refugees. Those living in the camps, prior to any transfer, must be absolutely assured of a chance to indicate their wish to move or return to East Timor without fear of intimidation -- a step that can only be accomplished through international monitoring. Those choosing to return to East Timor must also be assured protection from the moment they make their choice until they are safely back on East Timorese soil.  Consideration by the international community of economic sanctions against Indonesia unless a serious effort is made to protect the rights and security of refugees and those who work with them.  """"The violence in West Timor has implications for Indonesia's democratic experiment,"""" said Jones. """"Unless the government can impose its authority on lawless and criminal elements?including those within its own armed forces?the transition to democracy is going to fail, and not only the generals but the civilians in power are going to be responsible.""""","Asia, Indonesia","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

""""It's outrageous that the governor wants to prevent women from doing work they have done for decades, just because they are women,"""" said Regan Ralph, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division. """"It is a violation of women's rights to equality and to work.""""   The decree bars women from working in hotels, restaurants, and gas stations. The governor justified the ban as """"intended to honor women,"""" to uphold their status in line with Islamic law, and to respect the values and the traditions of the nation. He asserted that women should not be harmed by this decree because they could be employed in other areas.   According to local sources, Shell Oil recently started employing women in service stations. Some have speculated that this provoked a backlash, and that the order was targeted at women working in these stations. The order itself, however, goes beyond this. Women are banned from working in cafeterias, at cash registers, and anywhere in the service sector.   The government of Sudan has pledged to uphold women's equality by acceding to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. """"This ban defies guarantees of equality embedded in Article 21 of the Sudanese constitution and in international human rights law,"""" said Ralph.   Some Sudanese activists have expressed their fear that the decree is a prelude to removing women from all fields of public work. After years of civil war, many women are the sole providers for their families and rely on their income, even if the jobs are low-paying. The measure may also mean hardship for employers, who are required to fire women who turn up at work. Some employers have stated that they will have to shut down if women employees are not allowed to work.   Human Rights Watch calls on the President of Sudan, the Foreign Minister, and the Governor of the State of Khartoum to overturn the ban. The international monitoring organization also called on all employers, including foreign companies, whose female employees will be affected by this law to privately and publicly protest this ban.","Africa, Sudan","Women's Rights"

""""Antipersonnel mines are increasingly a relic of the past,"""" said Stephen Goose of Human Rights Watch. Nearly three-quarters of the world's nations have now joined the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty that outlaws any possession or use of antipersonnel mines. The United States is not among them.  The ICBL's 1,100-page Landmine Monitor Report 2000: Toward a Mine-Free World was edited and produced by Human Rights Watch, a founding member of the ICBL, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. The report provides new details on mine use, production, trade, stockpiling, demining and mine victim assistance in every country of the world in the period from the March 1999 entry into force of the Mine Ban Treaty to mid-2000. (See attached sheet on Key Findings of the Landmine Monitor report).  The report states that since March 1999 it appears that antipersonnel mines were used in twenty conflicts by eleven governments and numerous rebel groups. Angola, which has signed the treaty, continued to use mines, and it is likely that Burundi and Sudan, which are also signatories, used mines. The most extensive use of antipersonnel mines in this period occurred in Chechnya, especially by Russian forces, and Kosovo, especially by Yugoslav forces.  On Monday, 11 September, the ICBL will present the Landmine Monitor Report 2000 to diplomats attending the Second Meeting of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty in Geneva, Switzerland.

Russia to take specific action to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to cooperate with intergovernmental and nongovernmental agencies seeking to conduct their own inquiries. The centerpiece was a requirement that Russia establish a national commission of inquiry to investigate abuses, in order to hold accountable their perpetrators. This signified that henceforth Russia's commitment to accountability would be assessed by the way in which it mounted a credible and impartial inquiry. The resolution also urged Russian cooperation with U.N. thematic mechanisms, which were to be deployed to the conflict zone, and with the Organization for and Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other international and regional organizations. The Russian government rejected the resolution and refused to implement its chief requirements in a transparent manner. Five months after the resolution's adoption, Russia has made no meaningful progress toward establishing accountability for abuse.

""""This would not ?could not ?have happened if Indonesian authorities had taken steps much earlier to disband the militias in West Timor and prosecute them for known acts of violence,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"Instead, local civilian and military authorities gave every encouragement to these men and their political front organizations to intimidate East Timorese refugees under their control."""" The staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were killed today in the town of Atambua near the border with East Timor after a mob attack on U.N. offices. Thousands had gathered for the funeral of prominent pro-Indonesia militia commander Olivio Mendonca Moruk who was killed and beheaded the day before under unclear circumstances. (One report suggested he had been killed by public transport drivers reluctant to pay a tax he had imposed, another that rival militia leaders were responsible.) In 1999, Moruk was head of the Laksaur militia, one of the most brutal and notorious of the Indonesian army-backed militias in East Timor, and reportedly worked as an intelligence agent with Kopassus, the Indonesian army's elite special forces. He was implicated in a massacre in September 1999 of people taking refuge at a church in the town of Suai, as well as numerous other crimes. The Indonesian Attorney-General's office named him last week as one of nineteen people to be formally indicted for abuses committed in East Timor. """"The fact that Moruk was a known criminal in East Timor doesn't in any way justify his killing, but the fact that he continued to operate as a thug with complete impunity in West Timor indicates how unwilling the Indonesian government has been to act,"""" said Saunders. """"Indonesian authorities gave him and others like him a free hand, and made the deaths of these humanitarian workers a tragedy waiting to happen."""" He said the Indonesian government could not use as an excuse its lack of control over the militias; if it had wanted to exert control, it could have provided the resources and manpower necessary to do so.  Prior to the attack, UNHCR had reported more than 100 incidents of violence or intimidation of its staff by militias and their supporters. From August 22 to 29, UNHCR temporarily suspended its services in response to physical attacks on staff. The International Office on Migration also has faced repeated harassment and threats from militia leaders, with intimidation increasing in July and August.

His body was found with four other as yet unidentified victims some 83 km west of Medan on Sunday and was positively identified by the family on Wednesday. """"Jafar was a friend, a colleague, and one of the most dedicated human rights defenders I've ever known,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The most fitting honor to his memory will be to bring to justice not only his killers, but those responsible for the thousands of disappearances that have taken place in Aceh over the last decade.""""  Human Rights Watch learned that Indonesian police were refusing to let forensic doctors turn over the body for burial until additional medical reports from New York were received. An autopsy apparently revealed evidence of a colon operation Jafar had had in New York in 1998. The bodies found in North Sumatra had been dead """"more than ten days"""" according to a family member, who said it was not clear whether the cause of death was shooting or stabbing. Jafar Siddiq, a human rights lawyer and founder of the International Forum on Aceh, had left New York in June for a short visit to Aceh to further his efforts to draw international attention to the lack of progress on prosecuting grave human rights abuses in Aceh and to the need for a resolution of the conflict there. He was in Medan on August 5 to meet with an Acehnese businessman. He left that meeting around 1:30 p.m. and was not seen alive again. Thus far, no clues whatsoever have emerged as to the identity of his abductors, but the pattern of his disappearance has led most observers to assume that the Indonesian army was responsible. The provincial army commander in Medan has denied any involvement. An investigation by police in Medan, launched in part as a result of international pressure from the U.S. and other governments, has failed to produce any leads. Jafar now becomes the latest in a growing toll of activists killed or disappeared in Medan and Aceh. """"We find it odd that so many high-profile people can vanish or be killed, particularly in Medan, Indonesia's third largest city, and yet the police have not been able to make a single arrest,"""" said Jones. """"It would seem to indicate incompetence or complicity of the security forces."""" The conflict in Aceh dates back to 1976 but had a particularly virulent phase from 1990 to 1999 when Aceh was declared a special operations zone by the military, determined to crush armed rebels of the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM). Thousands of civilians were killed or disappeared during this period; many more were arbitarily detained. GAM was also responsible for human rights abuses, but not on the scale of the government's counterinsurgency forces. After fall of President Soeharto in 1998, many Achenese expected that finally, there would be serious investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the abuses. Very little happened. As a result a new, nonviolent movement arose among elements of Acehnese civil society, demanding a referendum on Aceh's political status, one choice in which would be independence. The government, first under President Habibie and now under President Abdurrahman Wahid, tended to make no distinction between GAM and the pro-referendum activists, although many of the latter distanced themselves from support for armed struggle.  In May 2000, President Wahid approved a """"humanitarian pause"""" in the conflict through a historic agreement reached by the government and GAM in Geneva, through the good office of the Henri Dunant Institute. That """"pause"""" was just extended, but in practice, it has meant no end to human rights violations.

Regrettably, the U.S. government did not strongly condemn Georgia for failing to bring those responsible for these attacks to justice in the State Department's Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, released yesterday.  Instead, the U.S. government downplayed the seriousness of the violent attacks by labeling them """"harassment,"""" and implying that bringing those responsible to justice was beyond the control of central authorities because """"local"""" police and officials were either responsible for them or had failed to intervene to halt them. But the Georgian central government not only failed to bring the perpetrators of these violent attacks to justice, in several instances officials actually charged the victims with crimes.  On August 17, about forty members of a nationalist group assaulted human rights defenders and a journalist as they left a trial they were monitoring at Guldani District Court, in a suburb of the capital, Tbilisi. On August 23 a police investigator at Nadzaldevi District Police Station told one of the victims of the August 17 attack that he would likely be charged with hooliganism, a criminal offense in Georgia. The victim, Giga Bokeria, works for the Liberty Institute, a Georgian nongovernmental organization dedicated to defending freedom of expression.  Bokeria told Human Rights Watch that he believes that there is a serious threat of further violence against members of religious minorities in Georgia, and that the government is using the attacks to distract public attention from its poor record on social issues.  """"This situation is becoming very serious. Its not just about us being beaten,"""" said Bokeria, """"The government has failed to fulfill it social obligations, and there is a lot of unrest.""""  The Georgian government has frequently lagged months in the payment of wages and pensions, and, according to multilateral lending institutions, has failed to collect taxes. In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that problems of governance and corruption have undermined fiscal stability in Georgia, and in May, it found that poverty in Georgia increased significantly throughout 1998 and the first half 1999.  the text of the letter follows:  September 6, 2000  President Eduard Shevardnadze State Chancellery Tbilisi Georgia  Dear President Shevardnadze,  Human Rights Watch is an independent, nongovernmental organization dedicated to monitoring human rights practices in more than seventy countries worldwide and to urging compliance with international human rights law and standards. It has maintained an office in Tbilisi since 1998. We are writing you today to urge your government to bring to justice those responsible for recent attacks on members of nontraditional religious confessions and on individuals who seek to promote religious tolerance in Georgia.  Throughout 2000, a number of violent attacks against adherents to nontraditional confessions went unpunished, and such impunity sent a message to the perpetrators that further violence would be tolerated. Indeed, instead of holding the perpetrators accountable, the authorities in one case chose to prosecute the victims. The lack of an adequate response to escalating violence against nontraditional confessions heightens our long-standing concern about Georgia's lack of commitment to freedom of conscience. On August 17 at approximately 12:30 p.m., a group of about forty people led by Basil Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Georgian Orthodox priest known as Father Basili, assaulted human rights defenders, a journalist, and members of the Jehovah's Witness faith as they left the Guldani District Court, in a suburb of Tbilisi. Among those beaten were Giga Bokeria and Kote Vardzelashivli, both of the Liberty Institute, a Georgian nongovernment human rights organization dedicated to defending freedom of expression. Bokeria and Vardzelashvili had been monitoring a trial involving members of the Jehovah's Witness faith and of Father Basili's group. Bokeria told Human Rights Watch that on August 23 a police investigator at Nadzaldevi District Police Station told him that he would likely face criminal charges of hooliganism.  The day before, members of Father Basili's group also attacked journalists and Jehovah's Witnesses who had been at the same trial. Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe reported that one of its correspondents, Sozar Subeliani, was assaulted and beaten as he attempted to cover the trial on August 16. Canadian human rights lawyer John Burns, who was monitoring the trial as a representative of the Jehovah's Witnesses, also said in a written statement that he was dragged to the ground and struck with a large wooden cross after Father Basili's supporters burst into the court room. Burns said that some of the approximately eighty members of the group present at the courthouse shouted insults, and threatened and assaulted spectators and Jehovah's Witnesses seated in the court room.  Father Basili's group calls itself the Guldani Orthodox Diocese, although to the best of our knowledge it is not formally recognized by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Its members espouse ultranationalist views, and are especially virulent in their intolerance of non-Orthodox faiths.  Among those on trial August 16 and 17 were Mirian Arabidze and Zaza Kshadze, victims of an October 17, 1999 attack by Father Basili's group who were themselves charged with article 239 of the criminal code (hooliganism). The August 16 and 17 incidents were only the latest in a pattern of escalating violence perpetrated by Father Basili's group: in the past ten months the group has been responsible for at least eight attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses and members of other faiths. The October 17 attack was particularly serious: between 120-150 members of Father Basili's congregation assaulted worshipers at a Jehovah's Witnesses service in Guldani District. Human Rights Watch collected extensive eyewitness accounts of this incident. At approximately 12:00 noon that day, a group of Father Basili's adherents arrived at a worship service being held at the Cultural House of the Guldani Technical College of Industry. Numerous victims told Human Rights Watch that their assailants, wielding sticks, chased and beat them, and others victims and eyewitnesses said their attackers chased, surrounded, and punched and kicked them. Footage of the incident, taped by the attackers themselves, later broadcast on the Rustavi 2 and Channel 2 news programs, and viewed by Human Rights Watch, confirmed this account: it showed individuals armed with large sticks threatening some Jehovah's Witnesses, others surrounding other Jehovah's Witnesses and striking them, and others forcibly restraining one individual and cutting his hair.  As a result of the incident, at least sixteen individuals required hospital treatment, and one, Pati Tabagkari, a forty-year-old Guldani resident, told Human Rights Watch that she sustained injuries so severe from the beating during the attack that she was incapacitated for a month and suffered permanent damage to her left eye. After the attack, seventy Jehovah's Witnesses submitted statements to the procuracy and Ministry of Internal Affairs officials.  Human Rights Watch considers it outrageous that the authorities pressed criminal charges against the victims of this assault, especially since the footage clearly identified the attackers, and that none of the assailants has been charged in relation to the violent physical assaults. Two female members of Father Basili's group were on trial on August 16 and 17, but only on charges of destruction of property.  Other alarming incidents targeting adherents to nontraditional faiths follow a pattern of violence, by which people who identified themselves as members of Father Basili's organization stalked Jehovah's Witnesses, and subsequently verbally or physically assaulted them. These include attacks on August 2, 2000 against Vladimir Marikyan and Sergey Barsigyan on Tianet Street in Guldani District, and on July 28, against a busload of Jehovah's Witnesses in Guldani on their way to a worship. According to a variety of sources, these incidents occur most frequently in Guldani District, in some cases near the headquarters of Father Basili's organization, in the Fourth Microregion of Guldani District. These include:  On January 16, at approximately 10:15 a.m., Lado Begeluri, and a companion, Giorgi Todua, both Guldani residents and Jehovah's Witnesses, were walking in the Fourth Microregion of Guldani when they were approached by a group of men who asked about literature they were carrying in a bag. The group of eight or nine men, approximately twenty to twenty-five years in age, then chased Todua and Begeluri. Begeluri told Human Rights Watch that when the group caught him, two of the members restrained him, while others kicked him, screamed insults at him regarding his religious beliefs, and stole the contents of his bag. He stated that his companion, Todua, was thrown to the ground and beaten by other members of the group, who also screamed insults at him regarding his religious beliefs, and identified themselves as members of Father Basili's organization. Begeluri identified some of those who participated in this incident as also having participated in the October 17 attack.  On February 13, shortly after 2:00 p.m., Lia Kikalishvili, a fifty-nine-year-old Guldani resident, and her companion, Medico Salukashvili, approximately sixty years old, were surrounded by a group men and women near Ahkmeteli Metro Station after leaving a worship service. Kikalishivi told Human Rights Watch that she and her companion were approached by a woman unknown to them who asked about the religious literature they were carrying. Subsequently, a crowd of about twenty people surrounded them, screamed insults at them and tore their clothing and other personal belongings. Members of the crowd surrounded Salukashvili, who suffers heart problems, vigorously shook and yelled at her. This incident lasted for approximately thirty minutes, and Salukashvili was incapacitated for several hours after. Kikalishvili told Human Rights Watch that she attempted to file a complaint at both the Eighth Microregion Police Station and at the Guldani Main Police station, but that officers refused to allow her to file the complaint.  On February 13, at approximately 1:00 p.m. a group of three men, approximately twenty to twenty-five years in age, approached Yuri Janashvili, a thirty-nine-year-old Guldani resident, and his companion, Vano Burduli, as they were walking in Guldani's Sixth Microregion. The three men asked Janashvili and Burduli about the literature they were carrying, and shortly after were joined by four more men, one dressed in a priest's robe, who yelled insults at them regarding the religious literature they were carrying. Janashvili told Human Rights Watch that some of those who participated in this incident also participated in the October 17 attack.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about the possibility of further violence, given the Georgian government's record of failure to prosecute perpetrators for previous violent attacks against religious minorities. We urge you to immediately call for end to the attacks and to bring to justice those responsible for them.

Throughout 2000, a number of violent attacks against adherents to nontraditional confessions went unpunished, and such impunity sent a message to the perpetrators that further violence would be tolerated. Indeed, instead of holding the perpetrators accountable, the authorities in one case chose to prosecute the victims. The lack of an adequate response to escalating violence against nontraditional confessions heightens our long-standing concern about Georgia's lack of commitment to freedom of conscience. On August 17 at approximately 12:30 p.m., a group of about forty people led by Basil Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Georgian Orthodox priest known as Father Basili, assaulted human rights defenders, a journalist, and members of the Jehovah's Witness faith as they left the Guldani District Court, in a suburb of Tbilisi. Among those beaten were Giga Bokeria and Kote Vardzelashivli, both of the Liberty Institute, a Georgian nongovernment human rights organization dedicated to defending freedom of expression. Bokeria and Vardzelashvili had been monitoring a trial involving members of the Jehovah's Witness faith and of Father Basili's group. Bokeria told Human Rights Watch that on August 23 a police investigator at Nadzaldevi District Police Station told him that he would likely face criminal charges of hooliganism.  The day before, members of Father Basili's group also attacked journalists and Jehovah's Witnesses who had been at the same trial. Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe reported that one of its correspondents, Sozar Subeliani, was assaulted and beaten as he attempted to cover the trial on August 16. Canadian human rights lawyer John Burns, who was monitoring the trial as a representative of the Jehovah's Witnesses, also said in a written statement that he was dragged to the ground and struck with a large wooden cross after Father Basili's supporters burst into the court room. Burns said that some of the approximately eighty members of the group present at the courthouse shouted insults, and threatened and assaulted spectators and Jehovah's Witnesses seated in the court room.  Father Basili's group calls itself the Guldani Orthodox Diocese, although to the best of our knowledge it is not formally recognized by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Its members espouse ultranationalist views, and are especially virulent in their intolerance of non-Orthodox faiths.  Among those on trial August 16 and 17 were Mirian Arabidze and Zaza Kshadze, victims of an October 17, 1999 attack by Father Basili's group who were themselves charged with article 239 of the criminal code (hooliganism). The August 16 and 17 incidents were only the latest in a pattern of escalating violence perpetrated by Father Basili's group: in the past ten months the group has been responsible for at least eight attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses and members of other faiths. The October 17 attack was particularly serious: between 120-150 members of Father Basili's congregation assaulted worshipers at a Jehovah's Witnesses service in Guldani District. Human Rights Watch collected extensive eyewitness accounts of this incident. At approximately 12:00 noon that day, a group of Father Basili's adherents arrived at a worship service being held at the Cultural House of the Guldani Technical College of Industry. Numerous victims told Human Rights Watch that their assailants, wielding sticks, chased and beat them, and others victims and eyewitnesses said their attackers chased, surrounded, and punched and kicked them. Footage of the incident, taped by the attackers themselves, later broadcast on the Rustavi 2 and Channel 2 news programs, and viewed by Human Rights Watch, confirmed this account: it showed individuals armed with large sticks threatening some Jehovah's Witnesses, others surrounding other Jehovah's Witnesses and striking them, and others forcibly restraining one individual and cutting his hair.

In a separate memorandum sent to President Clinton, Human Rights Watch detailed Russian failures to implement the resolution, which had called for a national commission of inquiry to investigate abuses with a view to eventual prosecutions.

Accession","09/05/2000","A new Human Rights Watch report outlines the most critical reforms needed in Turkey, and urges that they be included in the plan for Turkey's accession to the E.U.  The international monitoring group's report comes as the European Commission is putting the final touches on the E.U.'s Accession Partnership document for Turkey, which is due for final adoption by the Commission in November. This document will set out the steps Turkey must take to meet the E.U.'s membership criteria, which include """"stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for and protection of minorities.""""  """"This is not an exhaustive list of every reform needed in Turkey, but rather a practical baseline that should be addressed through the accession process to tackle the most persistent abuses,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch.  The issues discussed in the Human Rights Watch report include widespread and persistent torture, violations of free expression and minority language rights, continued instability in the southeastern part of the country, restrictions on the wearing of head scarves, and inadequate protection for refugees.  The rights group urged the E.U. to develop a detailed accession plan for Turkey, specifying unambiguous and measurable benchmarks. The Turkish government has a history of avoiding problems and placating critics with half-measures and empty gestures. In September 1999 the temporary release of Akin Birdal, imprisoned for a speech he gave while president of the Turkish Human Rights Association, and the partial amnesty of journalists in the same month, were clear maneuvers to avoid official embarrassment at the E.U. Helsinki Summit in December. Akin Birdal was rearrested in early 2000 and now sits in Ankara Central Closed Prison, while prosecutions of journalists continue. Human Rights Watch called for a detailed accession plan so that in the future the E.U. need not give credit for such insubstantial or ephemeral measures.  Human Rights Watch also sees clear advantages for Turkey in a detailed program. Suspicions have been voiced in Turkey that E.U. member states use human rights as a pretext for resisting Turkey's membership, while the """"real"""" problem is Turkey's sometimes strained relations with E.U. member Greece, or xenophobic fears about including a populous, predominantly Muslim country in a border-free Europe. A clearly enumerated and transparent process can give the Turkish people confidence that the human rights goalposts will not be moving perpetually out of reach.  The Human Rights Watch report identifies needed reforms and evaluates the Turkish government's current preparedness to tackle them. """"There is clearly a gap between how the E.U. and the Turkish government perceive the scale of the problem,"""" Sugden explained. """"What the Turkish government describes as 'some omissions', the European Commission has characterized as 'serious shortcomings in terms of human rights and protection of minorities.'""""  The Turkish government has signaled its plans for meeting the E.U. membership criteria in the form of two policy documents issued earlier this year, the """"Report on the Political Criteria of the Special Committee on Turkey-E.U. Relations"""" and the """"Calendar for Democracy, the Rule of Law and Human Rights.""""  Human Rights Watch welcomes the many praiseworthy objectives contained in the Turkish government's Report and Calendar, including abolishing the death penalty and incommunicado detention, and redrafting laws in order to ensure freedom of expression. However omissions include the full and free use of minority languages and other important safeguards against torture. The thousands of women excluded from education because they wear the Islamic headscarf and the precarious situation of asylum seekers are also ignored.  Human Rights Watch also criticized the Turkish government's lack of urgency. Reforms that are decades overdue are only scheduled for submission to parliament in eighteen months' or two years' time.  """"It is extremely disheartening to find that, according to the government's calendar, we have to wait until the end of 2001 for even draft measures to appear,"""" commented Sugden. """"Prisoners held for expressing non-violent opinions should not be left to languish in jail, held captive to Turkey's leisurely timetable for E.U. accession. The Turkish government has wasted a good deal of its first year in the candidacy process. The time for these reforms is now.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Habré who ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 before fleeing to Senegal, was indicted by a Senegalese court in February, marking the first time an African country had brought a rights case against another nation's head of state. After Wade was elected president in March, however, he named Habré's attorney as a special adviser and a presidential panel removed the judge investigating the case. The government then supported Habré's move to dismiss the charges, and in July a court whose presiding judge had just received a new presidential appointment threw out the case on the ground that Senegal had no jurisdiction to prosecute torture in Chad. Chad's torture victims have appealed to Senegal's highest court. The dismissal of the charges and the apparent executive interference drew protests from the United Nations, Senegal's association of judges and rights activists in both Chad and Senegal. United Nations envoys on torture and the independence of the judiciary expressed their concern to the government of Senegal over the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the charges and called on the government to ensure an independent and impartial investigation of the allegations. The UN monitors also reminded the government of its obligations under the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, to prosecute alleged torturers who enter its territory. In a July 21 editorial, """"Justice Denied in Senegal,"""" the New York Times called the ruling """"particularly disappointing"""" and protested """"what looks suspiciously like interference from the country's new president."""" """"Hissene Habré is an African Pinochet,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations which helped initiate the criminal action against Habré """"President Wade should support the victims' appeal and help put an end to the routine practice of the worst tyrants moving into comfortable exile next door."""" """"My country has always been a leader in human rights,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"The shenanigans surrounding this case are hurting our reputation and betraying those who placed their faith in Senegalese justice."""" Sixty Chadian victims are acting as private plaintiffs in the case as well as the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), which represents 792 victims of Habré's brutality. A 1992 Chad truth commission report accused Habré and his government of 40,000 political murders and systematic acts of torture and brutality. Habré 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habré's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1986) Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habré was deposed in December 1990 by current president Idriss Deby. President Wade, whose election ended decades of one-party rule in Senegal, is in New York to address the Millennium Summit of the United Nations.","Africa, Chad",""

The Chinese President will be in the U.S. on September 7 to meet world leaders at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. The new report, """"Nipped in the Bud: Suppression of the China Democracy Party,"""" documents China's systematic crushing of attempts by a group of activists to form the first legally registered opposition party since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. The activists, who announced the founding of the party on the eve of President Bill Clinton's state visit to China in June 1998, used the provisions of international human rights treaties as evidence of their right to organize. Some members had already been arrested when China finally signed ?but did not ratify ?one of those treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in October 1998. More arrests and harsh sentences followed.  """"As President Jiang is feted as an economic reformer during his visit, admirers should remember that in China, promoting political reform remains a hazardous occupation,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"What the world calls freedom of association, the Chinese leadership still calls threats to social stability."""" She noted that President Jiang had personally called for any political activities that challenge the Communist Party's monopoly on power to be """"nipped in the bud.""""  The China Democracy Party, a group that at its height probably had no more than 200 members, was composed mostly of veteran pro-democracy supporters. Some of them, such as Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, were active in the Democracy Wall movement of 1979-81, and they received some of the most severe sentences ?thirteen and twelve years in prison respectively. Other key leaders, such as Wang Youcai, had been imprisoned for involvement in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.  What distinguishes the China Democracy Party from other non-Party controlled organizations that emerged around the same time was its effort to register with the Ministry of Civil Affairs as a lawful """"social group"""" that intended to become a political party. Chinese officials made clear that any organization engaged in political activities was out of the question.  """"In China, trying to obey the law doesn't help if the law forbids challenges to the Party,"""" Jones said. The new report calls on the Chinese government to revoke all laws and regulations restricting the rights of free association, expression, and assembly.  The report also urges governments and U.N. officials to use high-level visits and meetings with Jiang and other Chinese leaders to press for the release of CDP members and prompt ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Jiang is scheduled to meet President Clinton in New York at the U.N., and Premier Zhu Rongji is scheduled to visit Japan in October.

""""It's a long-awaited first step, but serious obstacles remain,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The whole prosecution still is on shaky legal ground.""""  After East Timorese overwhelmingly chose independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised referendum, pro-Indonesia militias armed and supplied by the Indonesian military unleashed a scorched-earth campaign that left an estimated 1,000 civilians dead and most of the island destroyed. A quarter of the population was displaced, mostly by force, to Indonesian territory in West Timor.  The list of suspects, the first to be issued by the Indonesian attorney general's office since its investigation began in February, includes fifteen current or former Indonesian military and police officials, including three generals. It does not include General Wiranto, commander in chief of the Indonesian armed forces at the time, or Zacky Anwar Makarim, Indonesia's covert operations chief who was in East Timor when the violence began and widely believed to be one of its orchestrators.  Saunders said the list appeared to have emerged from investigations into five priority cases that have been the focus of the attorney general's efforts. They include a massacre on September 6, 1999 of displaced Timorese taking refuge in a church in the border town of Suai and an earlier massacre in April 1999 of people who had sought shelter in a church compound in Liquica, just outside Dili, East Timor's capital. The named suspects include top civilian and military leaders of Suai and Liquica.  """"I think we can assume there is reasonably strong evidence against those named,"""" said Saunders. """"The failure to list Wiranto and Zacky doesn't mean they're off the hook; it may just indicate that, for the moment, the attorney general doesn't have a case against them that would hold up in court."""" Saunders said prosecutors could still go after Wiranto on chain-of-command grounds if they can first prove a case against some of the lower-ranking commanders on the list. The problem now is the legal basis of the cases. The prosecution is proposing creating a special """"human rights tribunal"""" and is relying on a 1999 presidential decree to do so. Indonesia's parliament considered but did not enact the decree into law and has so far failed to pass other legislation that would provide for such a tribunal. More significantly, a constitutional amendment was recently enacted, after heavy lobbying by generals, that likely will bar prosecutors from charging suspects with international crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Human Rights Watch recently issued a briefing paper setting forth a detailed description and analysis of East Timor justice efforts to date.

We welcomed U.S. co-sponsorship of the resolution on Chechnya adopted by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in April, as well as your attention to this issue when you met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the Russian government's repeated promises to abide by international standards in Chechnya, arbitrary detention, torture, and other abuses continue there, and, as winter approaches, more than 100,000 displaced Chechens deeply fear returning home. The Russian government has taken no meaningful steps to hold accountable those responsible for abuses, and, as detailed in the attached memorandum, continues to flout the central requirement of the U.N. resolution: the formation of a national commission of inquiry. While it may have been reasonable for the U.S. initially to accept President Putin's assurances that Russian troops would abide by international law and that any violations would be prosecuted, the time for patience has long passed.  We urge you to join with your allies to communicate an unequivocal message to President Putin in New York: Russia must abide by its commitments in Chechnya, including immediate cessation of all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law; a transparent and thorough process of accountability for all violations; access to Chechnya for U.N. special human rights mechanisms and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights; and redeployment of the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya. A clearly defined timetable for achieving these benchmarks should be established; it should be made clear that if this timeline is not met, the Russian Federation will face renewed calls for international measures of accountability—such as an international commission of inquiry or an interstate complaint before the European Court of Human Rights. In addition, we hope that you will underscore with your Russian counterparts that international public support for financing through new loans from multilateral financial institutions or debt relief will depend on a demonstrated and consistent Russian commitment to rule of law, not only in Chechnya, but throughout the country. Thank you for your attention to these matters. We wish you a productive summit.

The decision by President Clinton on August 22 to invoke a """"national security interest"""" waiver eviscerates human rights conditions contained in legislation approving $1.3 billion in aid. This decision sends a clear message at a crucial moment to Colombia's Armed Forces that the United States will not hold them accountable for gross human rights violations. Since this aid remains the bulk of the contributions promised so far to Plan Colombia, we believe the effort is fatally flawed and should be reevaluated in light of human rights concerns. During the prolonged debate over the aid bill in the U.S. Congress, we urged the president and the Congress to include strong human rights conditions on any aid provided. Only in that way, we argued, could the international community be sure that its assistance was fortifying democracy and protecting rights. Despite its rhetoric, the Clinton Administration ignored human rights conditions and invoked the waiver, allowing the United States to fund a military the U.S. State Department itself has reported is abusive. As you know, the State Department has consistently reported that Colombia's Armed Forces have yet to take the measures necessary to punish human rights abusers within their ranks, particularly the officers who aid and abet the atrocities committed by paramilitary groups. In a report we published in February of this year, which we attach, we documented ongoing, intimate ties between Colombia's three most powerful Army brigades, located in the country's largest cities, and well known paramilitaries. Indeed, our research so far has linked half of Colombia's 18 Army brigades to the paramilitary groups responsible for the vast majority of human rights violations that occur there. We believe the U.S. decision to waive human rights conditions converts """"Plan Colombia"""" into a policy that exacerbates an already critical situation. Military aid without human rights conditions offers tacit approval of the Colombian military's continuing support for and tolerance of paramilitary groups. Any other programs risk being tainted or, worse, becoming irrelevant. As you know, the so-called Leahy Amendment remains part of U.S. law. It is designed to prevent most U.S. military aid from funding units and officers with notorious records. But it does not go far enough. The Leahy Amendment applies to only those few units that directly receive U.S. aid. Meanwhile, the bulk of Colombia's military forces continue to be implicated in serious human rights abuse. Vetting is largely secret, and legally only focuses on human rights abuses committed directly by troops. Not on the more common practice of aiding and abetting paramilitary atrocities. Colombia's high command continues, at the very least, to shield criminals within their ranks and cover up atrocities. Indeed, in June, Colombian Navy colonel Rodrigo Qui‘žnes, believed by government investigators to have set up a death squad and paramilitary groups in the early 1990s, was promoted to general. Colombia's soldiers continue to facilitate and actively promote the paramilitaries responsible for most human rights violations. Human Rights Watch continues to receive credible evidence that army units actively collaborate with paramilitaries in the field. Strong human rights conditions are needed to force the Colombian military to break these ties, prosecute abusive officers and their paramilitary allies, keep sensitive intelligence from being provided to paramilitaries, and ensure that government investigators and human rights defenders are fully able to pursue investigations of abuses. It is crucial that the European Union makes it clear to the United States and Colombia that action against military officers who aid or abet the work of paramilitary groups is an essential prerequisite for receiving any military aid. Since President Clinton has invoked the waiver, thus negating the stated U.S. commitment to human rights, it is essential that Europe withdraw support for Plan Colombia until such conditions are enforced. In this way, Europe would send a clear message that it holds both Colombia and the United States to their promises of furthering respect for human rights. Critical economic and humanitarian aid could be channeled through alternative sources, including civil society and humanitarian agencies.  As we have made clear, we encourage and welcome support for Colombia's Attorney General's office, the peace process, and nongovernmental and international organizations working to promote human rights and a peaceful end to the conflict. But this support is meaningless if Colombia's military continues to tolerate or actively perpetrate atrocities. The European Union has a central role to play in ensuring that impunity for such abuses is ended.

""""In terms of human rights criticism, the Howard government's motto seems to be ‘It is better to give than to receive',"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"It doesn't do much for protection of human rights if any government can change the rules to avoid criticism of itself."""" On August 29, three Australian ministers -- Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, Attorney-General Daryl Williams, and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Philip Ruddock -- issued a joint statement calling for a """"complete overhaul"""" of U.N. human rights treaty bodies to """"ensure that Australia gets a better deal"""" from them. Many of the major international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), have provisions establishing committees to ensure the treaties' implementation. These committees are known as U.N. treaty bodies. The Howard government was particularly angered by criticism from three such committees. In 1999, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination warned that government policies risked violating the rights of indigenous communities. In 1998 and 2000, the government was embarrassed by two high profile interventions by the Committee Against Torture to stop the return of asylum seekers until it had considered their claims that they would face torture if returned to the countries they had fled. And in July 2000, the Human Rights Committee of the ICCPR expressed serious concerns about Australia's mandatory sentencing laws, the marginalization of Aboriginal people, and the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  As a result, the Howard government says it will only agree to visits to Australia by treaty bodies when """"there is a compelling reason to do so,"""" and it will reject """"unwarranted requests from treaty committees to delay removal of unsuccessful asylum seekers from Australia."""" It says it will not sign or ratify a new optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women which establishes a complaint procedure, and it will fight against a greater role for nongovernmental organizations in the treaty bodies' activities. Human Rights Watch said the Howard government's decision to distance itself from the U.N. treaty bodies was particularly disappointing because in many areas, Australia has been a champion of human rights. Its support for an International Criminal Court to try perpetrators of grave abuses is one important example. Like the United States, however, Australia's support for human rights abroad has not always translated into good policies at home. Australian anger over critical U.N. scrutiny of mandatory sentencing, treatment of asylum-seekers, and Aboriginal policies has its parallel in U.S. resentment of U.N. investigation of capital punishment by U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions. """"The Australian decision on the U.N. is particularly unfortunate, because it will add a hitherto respectable voice to those of repressive governments seeking to undermine the international system for protection of human rights,"""" Jones said.","Asia, Australia","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/31/letter-mary-robinson","Letter to Mary Robinson","Letter to Mary Robinson","","08/31/2000","Human Rights Watch is profoundly grateful for the efforts of the United Nations Commission on Human  Rights, and in particular for your strong personal leadership, to stop atrocities in Chechnya and hold  accountable their perpetrators. It was thanks largely to your commitment to justice and basic U.N.  human rights principles that in April the Commission adopted a resolution deploring abuses in  Chechnya and calling on Russia to investigate them. CHR Resolution 2000/58 represented perhaps the broadest consensus among international actors that impunity would not be countenanced in Chechnya. Many viewed implementation of the resolution as the best hope for accountability. After its adoption, governments and international organizations that had pressed for accountability set aside alternative measures, such as an interstate complaint before the European Court of Human Rights, in favor of the process set out in the resolution. The resolution called on Russia to take specific action to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to cooperate with intergovernmental and nongovernmental agencies seeking to conduct their own inquiries. The centerpiece was a requirement that Russia establish a national commission of inquiry to investigate abuses, in order to hold accountable their perpetrators. This signified that henceforth Russia's commitment to accountability would be assessed by the way in which it mounted a credible and impartial inquiry. The resolution also urged Russian cooperation with U.N. thematic mechanisms, which were to be deployed to the conflict zone, and with the Organization for and Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other international and regional organizations. As you know, prior to the resolution's adoption, Human Rights Watch was profoundly skeptical that the Russian government would launch a credible national commission of inquiry that would result in a transparent and thorough accountability process. The authorities had taken no step that indicated a sincere intention to investigate war crimes and other abuses committed by Russian forces in Chechnya. Unfortunately, this situation has not changed in recent months.  The Russian government rejected the resolution and refused to implement its chief requirements in a transparent manner. Five months after the resolution's adoption, Russia has made no meaningful progress toward establishing accountability for abuse. It has effectively denied access to the conflict zone for thematic rapporteurs but has, to its credit, permitted limited access to Council of Europe representatives. In the attached memorandum we discuss the inadequacy of the Russian response to each of the key requirements specified by the Commission in the resolution. We hope that in your speech to the intersessional meeting of the Commission on Human Rights on September 15, you will describe in detail the response of the Russian government to efforts made by the Offices of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure compliance with the resolution's requirements. We would urge you to call on member states of the Commission to strongly condemn the continuing abuses against civilians in Chechnya and the Russian failure to accept the requirements of the resolution. Finally, we sincerely hope that you will continue to engage the Russian government to secure a follow-up visit to the region.  We look forward to continuing work with your office on this and other issues. Please accept our warm regards and best wishes for a successful intersessional meeting.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/30/deck-stacked-against-us-workers","Deck is Stacked Against US Workers","""""Deck is Stacked"""" Against U.S. Workers","Violations Undercut U.S. Position on Labor Rights and Trade","08/30/2000","Workers' basic rights are routinely violated in the United States because U.S. labor law is so feebly enforced and so filled with loopholes, Human Rights Watch said in a new report Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States under International Human Rights Standards . The 217-page report, """"Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States under International Human Rights Standards,"""" was based on field research in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Washington and other states. Human Rights Watch examined workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, and to strike under international norms. It found widespread labor rights violations across regions, industries and employment status. The report is being released on the eve of the annual Labor Day holiday in the United States. The U.S. government has called for """"core labor standards,"""" including workers' freedom of association, to be included in the rules of the World Trade Organization and the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. But Human Rights Watch charged that the United States itself violates freedom of association standards by failing to protect workers' right to organize. """"The cards are stacked against workers in the United States,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. government cannot effectively press another country to improve labor standards while violating them itself. It should lead by example."""" Each year thousands of workers in the United States are fired from their jobs or suffer other reprisals for trying to organize unions. Millions of workers are excluded from labor laws meant to protect workers' organizing and bargaining rights, and their number is growing, according to the report. Employers can resist union organizing by dragging out legal proceedings for years, the report said. Labor law is so weak that companies often treat the minor penalties as a routine cost of doing business, not a deterrent against violations. Some workers have succeeded in organizing new unions in recent years, the report said, but only after surmounting major obstacles. According to statistics from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency created to enforce workers' organizing and bargaining rights, the problem is getting worse. In the 1950's, workers who suffered reprisals for exercising the right to freedom of association numbered in the hundreds each year. In 1969, the number was more than 6,000. By the 1990's, more than 20,000 workers each year were victims of discrimination that was serious enough for the NLRB to issue a """"back-pay"""" or other remedial order. There were nearly 24,000 such workers in 1998, the last year for which official figures are available. Meanwhile, the NLRB's budget and staff have not kept pace with this growth. Among other conditions cited in the report that impede workers' freedom of association: workers fired for organizing and bargaining often wait years for their cases to be decided by labor boards and courts, while employers pay no price for deliberate delays and frivolous appeals; one-sided rules for union organizing unfairly favor bosses over workers, allowing such tactics as """"captive-audience meetings"""" where managers predict workplace closures if workers vote for union representation; millions of workers -- including farmworkers, domestic household workers, low-level supervisors, and """"independent"""" contractors who are really dependent on a single employer -- are deliberately excluded from labor law coverage for organizing and bargaining rights. They can be fired with impunity for trying to form a union; many workers find themselves caught up in a web of labor contracting and subcontracting, which effectively denies them the right to organize and bargain with employers who hold real power over their jobs and working conditions; employers have the legal power to permanently replace workers who exercise the right to strike; harsh rules against """"secondary boycotts"""" frustrate worker solidarity efforts. Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. Congress to ensure rapid reinstatement and full back pay for workers fired for organizing, as well as faster elections and expedited appeals to resolve unfair labor practices more quickly. The U.S. Congress should also ensure that protection of the right to organize be extended to farmworkers, household domestic workers, and others not currently covered by federal labor laws. Human Rights Watch also called on Congress to ratify International Labor Organization conventions on worker organizing and collective bargaining, and to strengthen U.S. laws protecting these rights. Selected case studies and workers' statements follow: Nursing home workers in southern Florida At the Palm Garden nursing home in North Miami, managers forged signatures on warning notices against Leonard Williams, a key union activist. They backdated the notices, then fired Williams shortly before a union election in April 1996. The union lost the election 35-32. Soon afterward, the company fired Marie Sylvain, another organizing leader. The NLRB has ordered Palm Garden to offer Williams and Sylvain reinstatement to their jobs with back pay. The agency also ordered a new election because of management's unlawful conduct. The company has appealed both rulings, and they are tied up in courts. Meanwhile, Wiliams and Sylvain must wait. """"Why does it take so long?"""" asked Marie Sylvain. """"I've been fired for more than three years"""" (now more than four years). """"Everything takes too long. Where is the justice? Everything is at the boss's advantage with all these delays. The law gives you something with one hand then takes it away with the other hand."""" Asked if she would accept reinstatement, Sylvain said, """"I would like to come back for one week just to show them the union can win."""" Workers at the King David Center in West Palm Beach voted 48-29 in favor of union representation in an NLRB election in August 1994. """"I had a determination to get respect,"""" said Jean Aliza, the first of several workers fired for organizing activity at King David. """"I am a citizen, and I deserve respect."""" The NLRB ruled that the company proceeded systematically to fire the most active union supporters, including Jean Aliza and Ernest Duval. But in 1999 the workers were still not reinstated because of appeals to the courts. Jean Aliza was """"set up"""" by managers and fired early in the organizing effort, after a year-long """"satisfactory"""" record suddenly became """"unsatisfactory"""" based on warning notices he never saw. The NLRB said that King David """"was determined to rid itself of the most vocal union supporter from the beginning,"""" referring to Ernest Duval. Ernest Duval was still vocal about his union support when he spoke to Human Rights Watch in July 1999, but he was also frustrated. """"I see the government protecting management,"""" he said. """"It's been four or five years now, and I've got bills to pay. Management has the time to do whatever they want."""" High-Tech """"Perma-temps"""" in Seattle A recent example of temporary agency workers' dilemma is found among workers at the cutting edge of the new economy. More than 20,000 workers are employed at Microsoft's facilities in the Seattle area. But 6,000 of them are not employed by Microsoft. Instead, they are employed by temporary agencies supplying high-tech workers to Microsoft and other area companies. Many have worked for several years at Microsoft, and have come to be known as """"perma-temps."""" Some Microsoft perma-temps formed the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTech) in early 1998. But WashTech has a """"Catch-22""""-type problem. By defining perma-temps as contractors employed by various temporary agencies, Microsoft avoids being their employer for purposes of the NLRA's protection of the right to organize. Meanwhile, the agencies tell temps that in order to form a union that agency management will deal with, they have to organize other employees of the agency, not just those working at Microsoft. """"First we asked our Microsoft managers to bargain with us,"""" said perma-temp Barbara Judd, describing an effort by her and a group of coworkers to be recognized by Microsoft. Management refused. Responding to press inquiries, a spokesman for Microsoft said, """"bargaining units are a matter between employers and employees and Microsoft is not the employer of the workers."""" Attempts to be recognized by the temp agencies were equally unavailing. """"‘We don't have to talk to you, and we won't' is what they told us,"""" said Judd. """"They told us we had to get all the temps that worked at other companies besides Microsoft. We had no way to know who they were or how to reach them. Besides, they had nothing to do with our problems at Microsoft."""" Barbara Judd's perma-temp post at Microsoft ended in March 2000 when the company announced it was abandoning the tax preparation software project that she and her coworkers developed. """"We received two days notice"""" of being laid off, Judd told Human Rights Watch. Some workers moved to another tax preparation software company, but Judd decided to look for full-time employment. """"I don't want to be a part of that system,"""" she said. """"Workers who take temp jobs do not realize there is a larger impact than just the absence of benefits. You essentially lose the ability to organize . . . [T]he legal system is just not set up to deal with these long-term temp issues."""" Steelworkers in Colorado Oregon Steel Co. permanently replaced more than 1,000 workers who exercised the right to strike at its Pueblo, Colorado steel mill in October 1997. Many of the replacements came from outside the Pueblo area, drawn by the company's newspaper advertisements throughout Colorado. A company notice declared, """"It is the intent of the Company for every replacement worker hired to mean one less job for the strikers at the conclusion of the strike."""" On December 30, 1997, three months after it began, Oregon Steel workers ended their strike and offered unconditionally to return to work. The company refused to take them back except when vacancies occur after a replacement worker leaves. Some workers returned under this legal requirement, but most of the Oregon Steel workers were still out of work in 2000 because the company permanently replaced them with new hires. According to a judge who held an eight-month-long hearing on the case, the company was guilty of interference, coercion, discrimination and bad-faith bargaining. In all, said the judge, Oregon Steel's unfair labor practices """"were substantial and antithetical to good faith bargaining."""" Under this ruling workers are entitled to reinstatement, because a company that violates the law loses the right to permanently replace strikers. However, the company has appealed the decision and has vowed to keep appealing for years before a final decision is obtained in the case. In the meantime, the workers remain replaced and without their means of livelihood for themselves and their families. Joel Buchanan, a worker with twenty-nine years in the Oregon Steel plant, told Human Rights Watch, """"Before the strike the company was pushing us for forced overtime. When we asked them to hire new people to give us some relief, they told us they couldn't find qualified workers anywhere in Colorado. But when we went out, suddenly they came up with hundreds of replacements."""" Apple workers in Washington Thousands of workers are employed in the warehouse sector of the Washington apple industry. Like apple pickers, many seasonal workers in the warehouses are migrants from Mexico. Apple warehouse workers are not defined as agricultural workers. They are covered by the NLRA, which makes it an unfair labor practice to threaten, coerce, or discriminate against workers for union organizing activity. But when workers at one of the largest apple processing companies sought to form and join a union in 1997 and 1998, management responded with dismissals of key union leaders and threats that the INS would deport workers if they formed a union. Here is how one worker described the company's tactics: At the meetings they talked the most about the INS. . . [T]he company keeps talking about INS because they know a lot of workers on the night shift are undocumented ?I would guess at least half. . . It is only now that we have started organizing that they have started looking for problems with people's papers. And it is only now that they have started threatening us with INS raids . . . They know that we are afraid to even talk about this because we don't want to risk ourselves or anyone else losing their jobs or being deported, so it is a very powerful threat. . . The union lost the NLRB election even though a majority of workers had signed cards to join the union and authorize the union to bargain on their behalf. H-2A workers in North Carolina About 30,000 temporary agricultural workers enter the United States each year under a special program called H-2A giving them legal authorization to work in areas where employers claim a shortage of domestic workers. H-2A workers have a special status among migrant farmworkers. They come to the United States openly and legally. They are covered by wage laws, workers' compensation, and other standards. But valid papers are no guarantee of protection for H-2A workers' freedom of association. As agricultural workers, they are not covered by the NLRA's anti-discrimination provision meant to protect the right to organize. H-2A workers are tied to the growers who contract for their labor. They have no opportunity to organize for improved conditions and no opportunity to change employers to obtain better conditions. If they try to form and join a union, the grower for whom they work can cancel their work contract and have them deported. More than 10,000 migrant workers with H-2A visas went to North Carolina in 1999, making growers there the leading employers of H-2A workers in the United States. North Carolina's H-2A workers are mostly Mexican, single young men, who harvest tobacco, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, apples, peaches, melons, and various other seasonal crops from April until November. At home """"there's no work,"""" workers told Human Rights Watch as their main reason for emigrating. Many of the workers come from rural villages in Mexico. In most cases earnings in U.S. dollars from their H-2A employment are the only source of income for their families and for their communities. Human Rights Watch found evidence of a campaign of intimidation from the time H-2A workers first enter the United States to discourage any exercise of freedom of association. Legal Services attorneys and union organizers are """"the enemy,"""" they are told by growers' officials. Most pointedly, officials lead workers through a ritual akin to book-burning by making them collectively trash """"Know Your Rights"""" manuals from Legal Services attorneys and take instead employee handbooks issued by growers. On paper, H-2A workers can seek help from Legal Services and file legal claims for violations of H-2A program requirements (but not for violation of the right to form and join trade unions, since they are excluded from NLRA protection). However, in this atmosphere of grower hostility to Legal Services, farmworkers are reluctant to pursue legal claims that they may have against growers. """"They don't let us talk to Legal Services or the union,"""" one worker told Human Rights Watch. """"They would fire us if we called them or talked to them.""""","United States, Economic Justice","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

The island nation on August 30 marks the first anniversary of the U.N.-supervised referendum in which voters overwhelmingly chose independence from Indonesia. Indonesian military-backed militias responded to the defeat at the polls with such systematic vengeance that an estimated two-thirds of buildings and homes across East Timor were destroyed, an equal proportion of the population was displaced, and an estimated 1,000 people were killed. Not a single perpetrator has been brought to trial. """"The facts are not in serious dispute. Indonesian-backed thugs launched a campaign of terror against civilians and left destruction and death in their wake,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"For the sake of the East Timorese victims, it's time to insist on much closer international involvement in the justice effort."""" The United Nations has recognized that it has a special obligation to see justice done for East Timor. The United Nations funded and was intimately involved in supervising the ballot that preceded the violence, local U.N. personnel were among the targets of the violence, and many U.N. staff witnessed atrocities. On January 31, 2000, an international commission of inquiry concluded that the systematic and large-scale nature of the crimes warranted the establishment of an international tribunal. To date, the U.N. Security Council has declined to establish such a tribunal, deferring instead to the Indonesia government's stated intention to bring those responsible to justice. In a 25-page briefing paper issued today, Human Rights Watch gives a chronological blow-by-blow account of what has -- and what has not -- been accomplished to date. The international monitoring organization details continuing obstacles to effective prosecutions in Indonesia and sets forth detailed recommendations for how to move the justice effort forward. Indonesia has announced it will name twenty or more suspects this week, but whether any of the most culpable leaders will be brought to justice is still very much in doubt. The briefing paper notes that even if competent and incorruptible judges could be found in Indonesia, there is no clear legal basis for prosecutions on anything except ordinary criminal charges. A constitutional amendment passed in Indonesia last week at the behest of the army makes it unlikely that anyone will face charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity, because they were not crimes under Indonesian law at the time they were committed. And a bill now being debated in the Indonesian parliament on a truth commission includes a provision by which those responsible for gross abuses could receive an amnesty in exchange for information. """"Politically entrenched generals continue to maneuver to block prosecutions. With each step forward, some new obstacle to justice emerges,"""" said Saunders. In its recommendations, Human Rights Watch calls on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Security Council members, and Indonesia's donors to set forth specific benchmarks and a timetable for the Indonesian prosecutions. Annan had previously said he would """"closely monitor progress"""" on the effort. Human Rights Watch said the benchmarks should include a clear legal basis for the Indonesian court that is to try suspected perpetrators; credible personnel appointed as judges, prosecutors, and staff; a good witness protection program; a prohibition on amnesties, and clear jurisdiction over not just crimes already extant in the Indonesian Criminal Code but also over international crimes such as crimes against humanity.  Human Rights Watch called on international leaders to demand decisive action by Indonesia to disband pro-Indonesia militias operating out of Indonesian West Timor and put a stop armed incursions into East Timor. The group called on Indonesia's trading partners to reinstitute a ban on commercial military sales to Indonesia should the government fail to put an end to the incursions by September 27. Human Rights Watch also urged increased resources for parallel prosecutions in U.N.-administered East Timor. The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) now has a dedicated """"Serious Crimes Investigations Unit"""" in place and has set up special international judicial panels. If Indonesian prosecutions fail, the work of UNTAET's prosecution team will be critical. Even if the most wanted Indonesian military suspects never set foot on East Timorese soil, the files may eventually be transferred to an international tribunal and can form a basis for prosecutions in other countries on the model of the Pinochet case. """"In a best-case scenario, effective prosecutions in Indonesia could lead to benefits not only for East Timor but also for Indonesia, as the wall of impunity that has long protected Indonesian generals breaks down and the truth about covert military operations emerges,"""" said Saunders.

If justice is to be done, the international community needs to be less naive about the Indonesian judicial system. At the moment, Indonesia -- not East Timor, and not the United Nations -- holds the key to accountability for the grave crimes that took place. Key member states of the U.N. early on rejected the idea of an international tribunal on both political and logistical grounds. Asian countries were wary of setting a precedent for the international prosecution of human rights abuses in the region -- Russia had Chechnya and China had Tibet and Xinjiang to think about. Some Western countries were worried about alienating the Indonesian army and provoking a coup at a time when Indonesia's transition to democracy was still fragile. There was also concern about the costs of setting up an international tribunal and who would bear the expenses. The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor, for its part, had to set up a court system from scratch. It designated a special international panel of the newly created Dili District Court and formally installed judges on July 20. But even if the panel has the structure and statutes in place to try serious crimes, it may not be able to get the serious criminals. Virtually all the masterminds of the violence are in Indonesia and still free. The likelihood they will be extradited to East Timor is low. Unfortunately, so are East Timorese expectations of justice in Indonesia. The Indonesian government under former President B.J. Habibie lobbied hard against a special U.N. commission of inquiry into the violence in East Timor, arguing that Jakarta could undertake an investigation on its own. In the end, both the U.N. and the Indonesian inquiries went ahead. The U.N. commission concluded in its January report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Indonesian army and militias were guilty of a pattern of gross human rights violations and breaches of humanitarian law in East Timor. That pattern included widespread and systematic intimidation, humiliation, terror, destruction of property, violence against women and displacement of people. Emphasizing that East Timor's future social and political stability depended on truth and reconciliation and the prosecution of those responsible for crimes, it recommended, among other things, that the U.N. establish an """"international human rights tribunal consisting of judges appointed by the U.N., preferably with the participation of members from East Timor and Indonesia."""" Much to its credit, the Indonesian government produced its own highly professional report that was harder-hitting than its international counterpart. Two more developments kept alive the international community's faith in the Indonesian government's commitment to justice. First, the Indonesian investigation was turned over in January 2000 to Attorney-General Marzuki Darusman, the well-regarded former head of the Indonesian Human Rights Commission. The second was President Abdurrahman Wahid's dismissal in February of General Wiranto, the man who had been commander of the Indonesian military when the sacking of East Timor took place. But General Wiranto's dismissal, while a triumph of civilian over military authority, hasn't led to prosecutions of army officers. And Mr. Marzuki appointed an investigative team made up of people not only from his office but also from two institutions linked directly to the 1999 violence: the police and the army. As counterweights, he appointed an advisory body of experts, including some highly credible human rights activists, but doubts about the quality of the team remain to this day. However, the obstacles to justice go far deeper than the competence of the investigators. The fact is that Indonesian courts are notoriously corrupt, and even if Mr. Marzuki produces indictments, it is still unlikely anyone will actually be convicted. If competent and incorruptible judges could be found, there is no clear legal basis for prosecutions on anything except ordinary criminal charges. A constitutional amendment passed last week by Indonesia's parliament, the People's Consultative Assembly, at the behest of the army, makes it all the more unlikely that anyone in Indonesia will face charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The constitution will now say no one can be indicted for crimes committed before the enactment of laws used to prosecute them. The assembly is currently debating legislation establishing a truth commission, but it includes a provision under which those responsible for gross human rights abuses could receive amnesty in exchange for information. Even more fundamental is the lack of support from key institutions in Indonesia for pursuing East Timorese cases. During the past two months, the same militias who torched East Timor in September 1999 have been terrorizing refugee camps and international humanitarian workers in hit-and-run raids across the border from West Timor. Had there been any political will in the Indonesian government to do so, the militia leaders could have been stopped and disarmed months ago. If the government can't -- or won't -- even arrest known thugs for causing violence on Indonesian soil, who is going to believe in their will to track down and arrest those responsible for crimes in their former colony? Following his trip to East Timor earlier this year, Secretary-General Annan promised he would """"closely monitor progress"""" Indonesia makes in redressing the crimes its security forces committed in East Timor. It's time Mr. Annan and U.N. Security Council members set specific benchmarks for progress. Those should include a clear legal basis for an Indonesian court to indict and try suspected perpetrators and credible personnel appointed as judges, prosecutors and staff. The court should have clear jurisdiction over not only crimes already extant in Indonesia's Criminal Code, but also crimes subject to universal jurisdiction in international law, such as crimes against humanity. Finally, Indonesian authorities should establish a witness-protection program and stop granting amnesties. If Indonesia can't meet these standards it should invite the U.N. to step in and set up a tribunal that can.

According to the court's ruling, made public on Saturday, the Spanish officials who requested Cavallo's detention now have sixty days to finalize an extradition request. Cavallo's arrest last week followed on the heels of the August 6 arrest and detention of another Argentine military official, retired Major Jorge Olivera, in Rome. Although Olivera is being held pursuant to an international capture order issued by a French judge, he has similarly been accused of egregious human rights abuses, including torture. The Cavallo prosecution is under the jurisdiction of Spanish Judge Balthazar Garz?, known for his prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, while Olivera's case is being handled by French Judge Roger Le Loire.  """"After so many years when the crimes of the Argentine military regime went largely unpunished, it's encouraging to see these two men in detention, facing a real likelihood of prosecution,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"These cases are further proof that the Pinochet prosecution has created real momentum in favor of the criminal prosecution of egregious human rights abuses.""""  Cavallo and Olivera are the first Argentines to be detained abroad for human rights crimes committed in Argentina during the country's 1976-1983 military dictatorship. Cavallo was arrested in Cancun on Thursday, August 24, as he attempted to catch a plane to Buenos Aires. Until his arrest, he had lived and worked in Mexico, serving as the director of the National Registry of Motor vehicles. Olivera, who lives in Argentina, was arrested at the airport in Rome as he was returning home from vacation with his wife. According to a November 1999 indictment issued by Spanish Judge Garz?, Cavallo, known by the name of Miguel Angel Cavallo, was a Navy lieutenant who worked in the notorious Navy Mechanics School (Escuela de Mec?ica de la Armada, ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the military regime. Between January 1977 and October 1978, the indictment states, Cavallo belonged to the operations sector of Working Group 3.3.2, a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing persons perceived as leftist by the military. The indictment names Cavallo as a participant in the torture of Thelma Jara de Cabezas, and the execution of M?ica Jauregui and Elba Delia Aldaya.  Olivera is accused of the kidnapping, torture and disappearance of French citizen Marianne Erize in San Juan province on October 15, 1976. At the time, he was allegedly an intelligence officer with the Army's Twenty-Second Regiment. Argentine Senator Jose Luis Gioja, whose statements were published in the daily papers Pagina 12 and Clar?, claims that Olivera personally tortured him while he was a political prisoner in San Juan in 1976.  Important progress in the criminal prosecution of """"dirty war"""" abuses is currently being made domestically in Argentina as well, Vivanco noted. A number of former military officials, including the president of the first military junta, have been arrested in conjunction with prosecutions involving """"disappeared"""" children. According to the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, more than 200 children were taken away from people who """"disappeared"""" during the military dictatorship. The children were either abducted together with their parents or were born in secret detention centers during their parents' captivity. The amnesty laws that bar most human rights prosecutions for the abuses that occurred under the military specifically exempts the cases of these children.  The 1984 report of the Argentine truth commission names 8,961 people who """"disappeared"""" under the military dictatorship, noting that this figure is not exhaustive. Although some high-level officials were criminally prosecuted in the 1980s for these abuses, the vast majority of military perpetrators were covered by the country's amnesty laws, while pardons issued by then-President Menem in 1989 and 1990 freed those who had been convicted. """"The struggle for justice in Argentina has been continuing since that time,"""" Vivanco explained.

The document contains specific cases that should be used to measure progress on the protection of human rights. Among them are pending investigations of 12 active-duty and retired members of Colombia's military credibly alleged to have committed human rights violations or to have aided and abetted atrocities committed by paramilitary groups. In addition, the document lists eight well-known paramilitary leaders and dozens of specific human rights violations perpetrated against individuals, organizations, and communities.  The groups noted that the human rights certification required for next year's allotment of aid is far from certain. Already, several U.S. senators and representatives who supported human rights conditions have criticized President Clinton for signing the waiver.

Recent disputes among the leaders of the Ugandan-backed rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy ?Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) which claims nominal control over the area, have triggered a mutiny of the military wing of the movement, and are exacerbating ethnic tensions in the region. Human Rights Watch strongly urged the Ugandan government and its local allies of the RCD-ML to issue clear instructions to their paramilitary forces to respect international humanitarian law, and punish violators.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/23/letter-president-museveni","Letter to President Museveni","Letter to President Museveni","Inter-ethnic Flighting Flares Up","08/23/2000","Dear President Museveni,   Human Rights Watch is writing to you today to express its deep concern about the reported flare up in the fighting between members of the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We have learned that in the week of August 14 several interethnic clashes occurred in the region of Bunia, the headquarters of the Ugandan-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML), including one, on August 14, in which about a hundred people, mostly Hema, were killed. We fear that these incidents may prepare the ground for the resumption of this deadly interethnic conflict, leading to more violence. We believe that, in view of its decisive influence in the region, your government bears a grave responsibility for ensuring that violence against civilians from whatever quarters is promptly contained, and those responsible for it are held accountable.   Human Rights Watch commends your government for its recent decision to investigate the conduct of some officers of the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF) over misuse of power during the conflict between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups. The Sunday Vision on August 13 quoted a spokesman for the UPDF, Maj. Phinehas Katirima, as saying """"I know of one officer, Capt. Kyakabale, who is being investigated. But I am not sure of the nature of the offence."""" It also quoted """"local authorities"""" in Bunia who esteemed that """"the clashes would have been resolved much earlier had it not been for the controversial role played by certain Ugandan officers who backed wealthy 'Hema' tycoons and 'Hema' militias against the majority 'Lendu' ethnic group.""""  Sparked in June 1999 by localized frictions between members of the two groups over land tenure issues, this fratricide war has so far resulted, according to U.N. estimates, in some seven thousands deaths. At least 200,000 people were displaced by the conflict at the peak of the crisis, and were hiding in the forests where humanitarian assistance could hardly reach them.  Human Rights Watch believes that the increasing divisions within the RCD-ML over the last few months have led to the exasperation of ethnic tensions between the Lendu and the Hema and to similar tensions among other population groups in the region. Prof. Wamba on Friday August 11 issued a decree suspending Mbusa Niamwisi, the movement's prime minister, and Atenyi Tibasima, the deputy prime minister, accusing them of fermenting the mutiny to evade accountability measures introduced by him. The two, and other dissenting RCD-ML officials, have countered that Prof. Wamba was not popular in the region, and that he lacked administrative and leadership skills.  However, this political contest rapidly assumed ethnic overtones. The two ousted officials have presided over recruitment for the Arm? Populaire Congolaise (APC), the military wing of the RCD-ML. They reportedly raised the army largely along ethnic lines, with Mbusa recruiting heavily among members of his Nande community, and locating his headquarters in the largely Nande town of Beni, and Tibasima enlisting mostly youngsters of his own Hema tribe. The ouster of the two might therefore have been a factor in fueling renewed violence in the region. In effect, we are also in receipt of credible reports indicating increasing tensions in the town of Beni, where supporters of Mbusa Niamwisi, the suspended prime minister, are reportedly poised to resist the installation of the official designated to replace him by the currently prevailing RCD-ML faction. According to reports, the UPDF has trained the military wing of the RCD-ML, and continue to exert decisive influences on events in areas nominally controlled by the RCD-ML. Indicative of these influences, Human Rights Watch is aware that you have last week agreed to a petition submitted to you by a delegation of elders from Bunia to spare their region the added trauma of an imminent confrontation between overwhelmingly superior UPDF units and the lightly-armed group of RCD-ML mutineers. The delegates have asked that Ugandan troops sent to Bunia to quell the mutiny use peaceful means rather than force to obtain the surrender of hundreds of young rebel soldiers who had fled to the bush after failing to oust the RCD-ML leader. One delegate told Human Rights Watch that many among the mutineers were child soldiers.  Given the tragic human costs of these events, Human Rights Watch urges your government to expand its current investigation of the role of the UPDF in the interethnic clashes in Bunia region beyond the officers who are under investigation. We urge the Ugandan government to conduct a full, independent and transparent investigation into reports of participation of some UPDF elements deployed in the conflict zone in civilian killings, and looting and destruction of civilian property. Those found responsible should be held accountable for their actions.  Human Rights Watch asks that the UPDF respect the fundamental rights of RCD-ML mutineers who may surrender to it. The UPDF should communicate a full list of their names and places where they are held to the ICRC and grant that agency access to all places of detention. All detainees should be allowed to receive visits from their family members.  Lastly, Human Rights Watch calls on the Ugandan government and the RCD-ML authorities to:  -Issue clear instructions to their forces to respect international humanitarian law.  -Allow unrestricted access and safe passage to humanitarian agencies trying to reach needy populations.  -Allow full access to independent human rights investigators looking into allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.  -Stop the recruitment of children in the Congo. RCD-ML soldiers under the age of eighteen should be immediately demobilized.

""""Clinton can turn his few hours in Arusha into an event of historic significance for the six million Burundians devastated by this brutal war,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"To do so, he has to back a treaty that will really work - one that ensures accountability for the guilty, whether Hutu or Tutsi - and he has to pledge U.S. aid to make international justice possible.""""  The accord calls for an international inquiry into genocide and war crimes in Burundi and for an international tribunal to be set up by the U.N. Security Council. A previous U.N. commission found that genocide and war crimes had been committed in Burundi in 1993 and recommended international trials, but none were held.  """"Investigation without effective prosecution amounts to amnesty,"""" cautioned Takirambudde.

Takirambudde deplored the recent upsurge in violence that may derail the scheduled signing of the treaty or upset its implementation. He called for the international tribunal to have an open-ended mandate, like that of the International Tribunal for former Yugoslavia.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/22/clintons-nigeria-agenda","Clintons Nigeria Agenda","Clinton's Nigeria Agenda","","08/22/2000","The last time President Clinton visited Africa, he avoided Nigeria like the plague. The year was 1998, and Nigeria was in its fifteenth year of military rule. Photo ops with the Nigerian dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, were definitely not on the White House itinerary. What a difference two years make. After elections in late 1998 and early 1999, the military handed over power peacefully to Olusegun Obasanjo, a military man himself, but one who professes a clear goal of returning Nigeria to democracy. Next week, President Clinton will reward Obasanjo with a two-day visit to Nigeria. President Obasanjo does deserve credit for some improvements in how Nigeria is governed, and he does need U.S. encouragement to do more. But the Clinton administration is moving to re-establish relations with the Nigerian military, whose human rights record has ranged from abysmal to appalling over the last several decades. Given this history, greater caution is surely in order. President Clinton's immediate problem is the military and political vacuum in Sierra Leone, a West African neighbor wracked by nine years of civil war. Unwilling to commit its own peacekeeping forces to a tiny country in Africa, Washington is seeking to win peace on the cheap, using the military muscle of Nigeria and other developing nations. The United States Special Forces intends to train up to five Nigerian battalions in combat, peacekeeping, and counterinsurgency, to prepare for their duties in Sierra Leone. Nigerian troops have been deployed in Sierra Leone since 1995, first as part of a West African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, now under the United Nations. These Nigerian forces have undoubtedly protected many civilians from Sierra Leone's notoriously abusive rebel force, the Revolutionary United Front. But Nigerian elements of ECOMOG were also responsible for serious abuses, including the summary executions of suspected rebels and their collaborators, extortion, and the excessive use of force. There's something deeply disturbing about Washington's unwillingness to commit its own military for peacekeeping operations. But if it's going to rely on Nigeria and other countries to do the heavy lifting, at least the Clinton administration has a responsibility to ensure they don't contribute to Sierra Leone's human rights problems. Nigerian peacekeepers should be rigorously screened to ensure that none were responsible for human rights abuses in the past, and they should be intensively trained in human rights and international humanitarian law. Nigeria and the United Nations should also set up some transparent mechanisms for monitoring the conduct of Nigerian troops in the field, and holding accountable any soldiers who are responsible for abuses. Respect for human rights has improved considerably since President Obasanjo took office in May 1999, but the police and army deployed to maintain law and order still fall back on the old methods of the military regime. At Human Rights Watch, we frequently receive reports of summary executions and arbitrary detentions. Perhaps most important, the crisis in the oil-producing Niger Delta has not abated. Local protests against the multinational oil companies have met with fierce retaliation from soldiers and members of the paramilitary Mobile Police. Local people in the Niger Delta are frustrated that they don't share equally in the oil profits. Violence and crime in the region are increasing. There's no question that the Nigerian government needs to restore order, but it must not use brute repression to do so. Last November, for example, Nigerian soldiers moved into the village of Odi, in Bayelsa state in the Delta, in response to the killing of twelve policemen. But the soldiers proceeded to demolish virtually every building in the village, and according to testimony collected by Human Rights Watch, they also killed dozens of unarmed civilians. President Clinton should make clear that he will condemn any attempts like this one, to impose central government control through violence. The Obasanjo government has quickly tried to distance itself from the military regimes of the past. In June 1999, President Obasanjo appointed a commission chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, to investigate """"mysterious deaths"""" and assassinations and other human rights abuses between 1966 and June 1998. However, the commission suffers from a lack of resources, and has had limited impact thus far. The government has also brought charges against a number of individuals accused of involvement in some of the most egregious abuses of the Abacha regime. But these prosecutions have been selective --Abacha supporters associated with the new government have been left untouched. On his last trip to Africa, President Clinton too hastily embraced a number of """"new leaders"""" on the continent. Most of them – in Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea – have since become mired in murderous wars with their neighbors and repression at home. The democratic transition in Nigeria, as Africa's most populous country, has tremendous implications for the whole continent. If he wants to nurture that transition, President Clinton must keep human rights at the top of his agenda.","Africa, United States, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy",""

Clinton's last trip to Africa, in March and April 1998, was the most extensive trip to the continent by a U.S. president, but he did not visit Nigeria, which was at that time still under military rule and subject to international sanctions. In May 1999, following sixteen years of repressive dictatorship by a series of military regimes, elected civilian government was finally restored in Nigeria. Clinton's trip is a recognition of the importance of Nigeria's transition, and the need to consolidate the recent gains to face the challenges ahead.   The decade and half of military rule in Nigeria was marked by economic collapse, political repression and systematic human rights violations. Following a protracted struggle for the restoration of democracy, which intensified following the annulled elections of June 12, 1993, and the deaths in 1998 of head of state General Sani Abacha and Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 elections, the interim government of General Abdusalami Abubakar conducted a series of elections in late 1998 and early 1999 which led to the restoration of civilian government under Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29, 1999.   The human rights situation in Nigeria has improved a good deal since the installation of the new administration. Civil and political rights, which were substantially eroded under successive military regimes, have been reestablished and are broadly respected by the government. In June 2000, the government affirmed its commitment to the international human rights regime by signing the treaty for the establishment of an International Criminal Court. The Nigerian people are gradually becoming accustomed to enjoying their civil liberties, though a particularly pernicious legacy of military misrule is the prevalent fear and mistrust of """"government"""" and its policies. The Nigerian media, possibly the largest and most diversified in sub-Saharan Africa, played a critical role in the reestablishment of democracy and has flourished in the more liberal environment created by the elected government. A survey on popular attitudes to democracy carried out in early 2000 found strong popular sentiments in favor of democratic governance among 80 percent of the Nigerian population. .The government has also embarked on an intensive campaign to restore diplomatic and economic relations with the international community, which were badly damaged under military rule. In turn, the U.S. government - like other governments - has deepened its engagement with Nigeria; several intergovernmental cooperation initiatives are underway in the political, economic, and commercial spheres. Several high-level U.S. officials have made visits to Nigeria and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has described Nigeria as one of four priority countries to assist in the consolidation of democratic government. U.S.AID is presently coordinating a major interagency democracy and governance assistance project in Nigeria including security sector reform. President Obasanjo has visited the U.S. twice since winning the presidential elections in February 2000.   These improvements notwithstanding, there are serious human rights concerns which have not been addressed by the government, and civil society groups in Nigeria point to several missed opportunities to improve constitutional governance. Nigeria experienced economic ruination under military rule. The national infrastructure and virtually all public institutions, including the judiciary and the security forces, decayed during this period. The constitution itself, imposed by the military, lacks legitimacy. The expectation of Nigerians and the international community was that an elected government faced with these realities would focus on a legislative agenda to begin rebuilding the country. This has not happened. Since late 1999, there has been protracted discord between the executive branch and the legislature. The result of this is that very little new legislation has been passed as the presidency and the National Assembly constantly bicker and seek public support for their respective positions on national issues. The National Assembly has been struck by repeated corruption scandals, even as it debated new anti-corruption legislation: in late July 2000, a Senate panel held hearings during which testimony was given of wildly overinflated prices for contracts awarded by the National Assembly; the report recommended that the Senate president and deputy president be removed from their posts, and that the police investigate the findings against them and others. The National Assembly accuses President Obasanjo of still being a dictator at heart, pointing to his military background and his human rights record when he was the military ruler of Nigeria from 1976 to 1979. It does not help that President Obasanjo has at times seemed to show contempt for the media and human rights groups. Considering the many challenges faced by Nigeria's civilian government, the lack of progress in establishing a reform program, starting from the urgent need to create an agreed constitutional framework for the country, is worrisome.   Most disturbing of all has been the renewal of state violence in the Niger Delta. In late November 1999, Nigerian soldiers moved into Odi, a community of perhaps 15,000 people in Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta, engaged in a brief exchange of fire with some young men alleged to be responsible for the deaths of twelve policemen, and proceeded to raze the town. The troops demolished every single building, barring the bank, the Anglican church, and the health center. According to testimony collected by Human Rights Watch and Nigerian human rights groups, soldiers may have killed dozens of unarmed civilians. According to the Nigerian constitution, the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the power to determine the operational use of the army, including when it acts in support of civilian authorities to restore order. While there have been some government efforts to provide relief to the residents of Odi, there has been no government support for the independent investigation of the abuses committed and accountability of those responsible.   This document seeks to highlight the major concerns for human rights and constitutional governance and raise issues for U.S. policy towards Nigeria. These concerns include: investigation of past abuses and restoration of the rule of law; continuing abuses by the security forces and criminal justice system; the situation in the Niger Delta; ethnic, sectarian and communal violence in various parts of Nigeria, including violence deriving from the extension of the application of Sharia law; constitutional reform; and the electoral system.

In June 1999 the president appointed a commission chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, to investigate """"mysterious deaths"""" and assassinations and other human rights abuses during the period January 1966 to June 1998, and to make recommendations to redress past injustices and to prevent future violations (widely referred to in Nigeria as the Oputa Commission). The commission has a three-year mandate within which to complete its work, and has received approximately 11,000 petitions, mostly from Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta. However, the Nigerian government has given very limited resources to the commission and its impact has been very limited thus far. As it is chronically underresourced, it has only a two-room office in the federal secretariat and a minuscule support staff. Public knowledge of the commission's existence is very limited, especially in rural areas; many would-be petitioners have not had the opportunity to tell of the abuses that have affected them. All the commission's public activities and the training of its personnel have been funded by donors working with civil society groups.   In addition to appointing a commission to examine past violations, the Nigerian government has brought charges against a number of individuals accused of involvement in some of the more egregious violations of the Abacha regime. Those charged include Mohammed Abacha, son of the former head of state, and Major Hamza al-Mustapha, his former head of security. They are charged with various offenses including murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy in relation to """"death squad"""" activity during the Abacha regime; in particular, the murder in 1996 of Kudirat Abiola, wife of Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the aborted 1993 presidential elections who died in detention in 1998. She had championed her husband's release and installation as president of Nigeria. Mohammed Abacha is separately charged with theft of public funds and is being investigated by a Swiss magistrate, George Vecchin at the instance of the Nigerian government in connection with public funds allegedly stolen by his father and deposited in Swiss banks. General Jeremiah Useni, a close associate of General Abacha is under indictment by the code of conduct tribunal for failure to disclose assets acquired while in public office. While these prosecutions are welcome, some Nigerians, especially those from the north of the country, are concerned that the selection of people to prosecute is selective, and that the government has not made the same effort to pursue many others associated with the abuses of the military period. There is an apparent reluctance of the government to investigate and prosecute of several of General Abacha's associates who are leading members and financiers of the ruling People's Democratic Party, including the former president, Ibrahim Babangida.   President Obasanjo also appointed panels to look into appointments and contracts made during the period leading up to the handover to civilian rule, when billions were reportedly stolen, and into failed contracts and fraudulent land transactions under successive military governments. The government has made strenuous efforts to recover stolen funds held in foreign bank accounts, and accounts in both Switzerland and Luxembourg have been frozen to a total value of more than U.S.$1.2 billion. In June 2000, President Obasanjo finally signed into law the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, after long delays in securing its passage through the National Assembly. However, it appears that corrupt spending of government funds has continued unabated: in late July 2000, a Senate panel held hearings during which testimony was given of wildly overinflated prices for contracts awarded since civilian government was restored; the report recommended that the Senate president and deputy president be removed from their posts, and that the police investigate the findings against them and others. While the deputy president resigned, the Senate brought impeachment proceedings against the president. There are also credible reports of continued spending by the executive without legislative oversight, while the accounting procedure for the funds recovered from overseas has been less than satisfactory, with discrepancies in the figures provided by the Accountant General and the Central Bank of Nigeria.  Reform of the Justice System  Immediately before the handover of power to President Obasanjo, General Abubakar announced the repeal of a number of military decrees that had permitted a wide range of acts in violation of international human rights law. While a most welcome step, the many years of military rule in Nigeria have built up a large body of other laws that reflect their military origins and infringe on the rights of the Nigerian people. Among the laws causing concern are the Public Order Act 1979 and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Decree. The new civilian government also made commitments to respect the rule of law. Nevertheless, there are disturbing incidents of federal and state public officials continuing to disobey court orders with apparent impunity. In one case in late 1999, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency failed to release suspects granted bail by the Federal High Court for several months and no disciplinary action was taken against the officers responsible. While the number of such incidents has significantly reduced since the restoration of democracy, it is worrisome that some federal and state public officials continue to willfully disregard court orders.   The collapse of the criminal justice system under military rule continues to result in serious and systematic human rights violations including the prolonged incarceration without trial of criminal suspects. The government has stated that it is committed to improving prison conditions, and federal and state governments have announced a series of amnesties for prison inmates. In January 2000, the government announced that all prisoners under sentence of death and awaiting execution for twenty years or more would be granted total pardon, and that those awaiting execution between ten and twenty years would have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. This has merely scratched the surface of the problem, and the government is yet to address the root cause of prison congestion, the collapse of the criminal justice system. Minister of State for Internal Affairs Alhaji Danjuma Goje announced on July 15, 2000 that pretrial detainees represent over 70 percent of the prison population, and that 32,000 are currently incarcerated awaiting trial. These problems plague the civil law system as well: on average, delays in a civil or commercial case filed in a magistrate or superior court will amount to three to six years before trial. The loss of faith by the Nigerian public in the judicial system and in the impartiality and effectiveness of the police has resulted in violent private """"law enforcement"""" through vigilante activity, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths over the last year, as well as arbitrary destruction or confiscation of property.   Although the federal government has negotiated a multisector loan from a consortium of donors including U.S.AID and the World Bank, of which legal and judicial reform is a component, it is not clear that the government has the political will to rebuild the criminal justice system. Astonishingly, no recurrent or capital allocation was made for the judiciary in the draft budget for the year 2000. The chief justice of Nigeria protested the omission to President Obasanjo who acknowledged the error and apologized. That budget officials completely """"forgot"""" the existence of the judiciary is symptomatic of the mindset in the executive towards the judiciary.  Law Enforcement and Security Sector Reform  Demonstrating a determination to bring the armed forces under control, Obasanjo removed several hundred army officers from their posts shortly after taking office, and announced plans to cut the military in size from 80,000 to 50,000 over four years. The Nigerian government has been working with both the U.S. and British governments toward strengthening civilian control and legislative oversight of the armed forces.   At the same time, the Nigerian government announced plans to increase the police force to nearly double its present size of 135,000. Yet no parallel announcement was made that comprehensive police reform would be undertaken. The Nigerian police are still governed by a colonial law first promulgated in 1943, and there are no effective provisions for civilian oversight of the force or for political accountability in case of abuse. Ordinary police officers are ill-paid and poorly trained, and consequently often corrupt; sexual discrimination and harassment of women police officers is routine. In addition, there is a paramilitary mobile police force, first established in 1959 and nicknamed """"kill-and-go"""" by the civilian population in the early 1980s for their trigger-happy disposition. The mobile police were established as anti-riot police but now also serve as regular enforcement officers. They comprise the special anti-robbery squads and are deployed to long term patrols in areas of conflict such as the Niger Delta. The mobile police are notoriously brutal, and are even less subject to civilian oversight than the ordinary police. In April 2000, Mobile Policemen went on a rampage in the town of Suleja in Niger State and killed at least twenty civilians in a drunken shooting spree following an attack by unarmed civilians on their post during riots to protest the appointment of a traditional leader. The abusive paramilitary anti-crime units established under the military government have been disbanded since the end of military rule and replaced by police units that do not include soldiers. The methods used by the new units seem, however, to resemble those of their predecessors. The policemen who make up these units have continued to commit human rights violations with apparent impunity. Extortion, torture, and extrajudicial executions are commonplace. Supervision by senior officers is weak, and there is evidence that Mobile Police commanders turn a blind eye or are themselves complicit in human rights abuses.   In July 2000, the Network on Police Reform in Nigeria (NOPRIN) was established, coordinated by the NGO Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN) with the support of U.S.AID and the British Department for International Development. NOPRIN has identified five thematic areas for police reform: police operations and accountability; human resources; training and career development in the police; gender and policing; police legislation and standing orders; and community-police relations. Five civil society groups have nominated representatives to be part of a larger consultative group involving the three arms of government (the executive, legislature, and judiciary) on police reform.   Nigeria's principal intelligence agencies, the State Security Service (SSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI), have a history of repression. Persons detained by these agencies reported being tortured to make confessions especially under the Babangida and Abacha regimes. To date, there is no information as to whether those alleged to be responsible for torture have been held accountable under the law. Since the restoration of civilian rule, some of those critical of the government have been arrested, interrogated, and arbitrarily detained for days or weeks; the agencies seem yet to rid themselves of the bad habits acquired under military rule. Although the Senate and the House of Representatives have committees which supposedly oversee the SSS and the NIA, which report to the presidency, the agencies continue to operate under a shroud of complete secrecy. The legislators do not have effective access to information on the activities of the agencies and so cannot exercise their powers of oversight. The intelligence budget is not subject to legislative scrutiny.  The Niger Delta  The crisis in the oil producing regions has resulted in some of the worst human rights violations since the restoration of civilian rule. The Niger Delta has been the site of major confrontations between the people who live there and the security forces, resulting in extrajudicial executions, mass internments of civilians, arbitrary detentions, and draconian restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. These violations of civil and political rights, which reached a climax during the """"Ogoni crisis"""" of 1993 to 1996, have been committed principally in response to protests about the activities of the multinational companies that extract Nigeria's oil and the lack of local accountability for the way in which the oil revenue is used by the Nigerian government.   Since the restoration of an elected civilian government, there has been a surge in demands for the government to improve the position of the different groups living in the oil producing areas. In addition there has been an increase in criminal acts such as kidnappings of oil company staff in hope of ransom payments, and violence among neighboring ethnic groups over matters such as the location of local government headquarters, crucial in the distribution of oil resources. In September 1999, demonstrations at the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Atlantic coast at Bonny, reportedly the largest single investment site in Africa, delayed Nigeria's first exports of LNG, indicating the continuing threat of major disruption to Nigerian government revenue.   Although there is a clear need for law and order to be established in those parts of the delta where criminal activities and the violence between neighboring ethnic groups has been worst, the security forces have both failed to protect civilians from violence in many cases, and have also themselves carried out serious and widespread violations of human rights. Security force action has often been indiscriminate, or targeted at those who have not committed any crime but have protested oil production in accordance with their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association.   The Nigerian government has deployed large numbers of soldiers and paramilitary Mobile Police across the delta, including a special task force to protect oil pipelines, and has announced plans for the training and equipping of a """"special"""" police unit to be deployed in the Niger Delta. This unit would be drawn from elements of the Mobile Police, which has been responsible for serious human rights violations in the delta and other parts of Nigeria. In June and July 2000, the federal task force charged with protecting oil pipelines carried out several extrajudicial executions in oil producing communities in Delta State. The victims were persons suspected of vandalizing pipelines or stealing petroleum products, and included at least three children aged between eight and fourteen years.   The government has removed troops and police of ethnic Ijaw origin from the Niger delta on the allegation that they are providing weapons and training to fellow Ijaws who are engaged in conflicts with oil companies and local ethnic groups. While there are concerns that elements of the security forces who are of local origin may be partisan in ethnic clashes, it is also the case that security detachments made up of outsiders to the delta have often been more willing to use lethal and indiscriminate force. In November 1999, an army unit destroyed the town of Odi in Bayelsa State, allegedly in response to the killing of twelve policemen by local youths. Testimony collected by Human Rights Watch and Nigerian groups supports allegations that dozens of civilians, most of them unarmed, were killed. Graffiti left in Odi by the troops included ethnic slurs and clearly conveyed an """"us"""" against """"them"""" mindset. In all cases of bias or abuse by the security forces, the correct government response is to bring to justice those responsible, in accordance with international standards of due process, not to create an environment in which abuses become more probable. There has been no government-supported independent investigation of these events, and no military personnel are known to have been prosecuted for the atrocities committed in Odi.   In March and April 2000, repressive force was once again used in Ogoniland, Rivers State, when paramilitary Mobile Police deployed to the village of K-dere, Gokana local government area, following disputes over the completion of development projects to be funded by Shell. The security forces killed at least one civilian, razed a number of buildings, and arrested several Ogoni activists, including Ledum Mitee, a leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and codefendant of minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa who was executed by the military government in November 1995.   In response to local demands for greater resource ownership and benefits, President Obasanjo introduced a bill to establish a Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Most leaders of the ethnic groups based in the Niger Delta, however, initially rejected the bill since it did not address their concerns surrounding revenue allocation and resource control and appeared likely to duplicate similar corruption-ridden bodies created by previous administrations. In particular, opponents to the draft bill objected to the proposal that 50 percent of the finance for the commission should come from the 13 percent of revenue that the 1999 constitution provides shall be allocated on a """"derivation principle,"""" returning to states from which the revenue is derived. In effect, they argued, the commission would actually take away money that should already go to the oil producing states under the new constitution. In response to these criticisms, the National Assembly amended the draft bill to reflect some of these concerns: the bill as passed would have the NDDC funded by the federal government and by oil companies operating in the area. The 13 percent revenue will go to the states unimpaired - though there have been substantial delays in actually making these payments, and it is still not clear whether the allocations will be backdated to June 1999, when the constitution came into force. President Obasanjo vetoed these amendments but the bill was subsequently passed by a two-thirds majority, overriding the president's veto. The president however sent an amendment to the bill back to the National Assembly. This amendment will be considered during the legislative session which began on July 13, 2000.   The oil companies operating in Nigeria, which operate joint ventures with the Nigerian government, also share a responsibility to ensure that oil production does not continue at the cost of violations of the rights of those who live in the areas where oil is produced. U.S.-based oil companies operating in Nigeria include Chevron, Mobil and Texaco. The U.S. government has undertaken an initiative on corporate responsibility and human rights in the oil industry, to promote dialogue and encourage best practices.   The level of anger against the federal government and the oil companies among the residents of the oil producing communities means that further protest is likely, as are further incidents of hostage taking and other criminal acts. Yet any attempt to achieve a forcible solution to these problems will certainly result in widespread and serious violations of Nigeria's commitments to respect internationally recognized human rights. While it is certainly necessary to establish the rule of law in the delta, a quiet achieved by repressive means can only be temporary and will result in more violence in the longer term.  The Extension of Sharia Law  Several states in northern Nigeria have, since September 1999, introduced or announced plans to extend the application of Islamic Sharia law to criminal offenses. Many parts of northern Nigeria have predominantly Muslim populations. Under colonial rule, common law was applied in these areas, but Sharia continued to be applied throughout the colonial period to personal law among Muslims. Post independence constitutions continued to restrict the scope of Sharia to personal law, but with the most recent restoration of civilian rule, politicians have responded to popular concern at rising levels of crime and discontent with the functioning of the criminal justice system by promoting the extension of the application of Sharia to criminal offenses. This move has been extremely popular among sectors of the Muslim population, and rallies in support of the application of Sharia have attracted tens of thousands of people in some cities. Despite assurances that the application of Sharia will be restricted to Muslim Nigerians, due process issues and the nature of some punishments imposed by Sharia, notably amputation and flogging, mean that the many thousands of Christians living in the north are deeply concerned that Sharia law and punishments will be applied to them also.   Sharia law punishments including amputation and flogging have been imposed in Zamfara State for offenses such as cattle theft and fornication. In March 2000, a suspected cattle thief had his arm amputated on the orders of a Sharia court; in April 2000, a male youth was flogged for fornication while his partner, a female minor received a suspended sentence as she was menstruating at the time she was to be flogged. Women in states that have implemented Sharia law are prohibited from employment outside their households and from sharing taxis and buses with men. The sale of alcohol and tobacco is prohibited and Muslims are expected to adopt """"Islamic dress"""" including the veil for women. The Zamfara state government has established Sharia courts and an Islamic youth association to enforce the Sharia laws. The youth association is charged with detecting offenders and bringing infractions to the notice of the Sharia courts, and in at least two known instances have done so. In other states that have extended Sharia law, local Islamic voluntary organizations work with the Sharia courts to enforce the Sharia laws. The police commissioner of Zamfara state refused in a newspaper interview to state whether or not he would instruct his officials to enforce Sharia laws, but stated that he would seek clarification from his superiors; the state governor stated that the police had been ordered to enforce Sharia.   Nigeria has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and has signed but not ratified the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. From the standpoint of these human rights treaties, the provenance of a country's law is not of paramount concern - so long as it is in conformity with international human rights law, including the prohibition on cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment and the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture has confirmed that punishments such as amputation and flogging are breaches of the Convention Against Torture. Many of the restrictions imposed on women are equally breaches of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Nigerian human rights groups also argue that these practices are in violation of the Nigerian constitution, and that the government should take steps for the Supreme Court to consider the issues raised and issue an advisory opinion. However, the northern state governments have consistently dismissed these criticisms as based on Western values. The Nigerian government has refused to take legal steps to determine the constitutionality or otherwise of Sharia law, stating that it prefers a """"political"""" solution.  Ethnic, Sectarian, and Communal Violence  A wave of ethnic, sectarian, and communal violence has swept across Nigeria since the restoration of elected civilian government in May 1999. Several hundred people have lost their lives in these incidents. Some of this violence is the result of longstanding interethnic and intercommunal disputes, which successive governments have at best ignored and at worst provoked or worsened by discriminatory application of the law, violent police or military action, and the distribution of government resources to favor one group over another. In late 1999 and early 2000, there were riots in Lagos in which the O'odua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba nationalist group, clashed with Hausas from the north of Nigeria living and working in the city. A committee of the Lagos State Senate investigated the violence, and found that at least nine policemen, seven OPC members and 163 innocent civilians had lost their lives. Twelve police stations had been burnt down. In recent months, much violence has followed the extension of Sharia law to criminal offenses in some states of northern Nigeria. Reports of the planned introduction of Sharia law led to clashes between Muslims and Christians in Kaduna and Kano in February 2000. At least 700 people were killed in these disturbances and in reprisal killings of Muslims in southeastern Nigeria that followed. Protracted communal and ethnic violence is also ongoing between the Aguleri and Umuleri (Anambra State), Ife and Modakeke (Osun State), and Jukun and Kuteb (Taraba State) communities.   Lack of faith in the criminal justice system is certainly a factor in the emergence of ethnic militias in the last two years, a particularly disturbing phenomenon. In some cases, these militias have obtained automatic weapons, significantly increasing the death tolls in communal and sectarian conflicts. The various militias claim to be vigilante units defending local populations against the rise in violent crime, which the police have appeared unable to contain. They are responsible for hundreds of murders of suspected criminals across Nigeria in the last twelve months. They operate on the basis of denunciations of suspects by local residents and administer """"instant justice"""" by lynching their victims usually by """"necklacing"""" - being burned alive by a burning tire placed around their neck. The vigilante/militia groups have also become involved in inter-ethnic and inter-communal conflicts.   Some government officials have spoken out against such vigilante action. However, in July 2000, the governor of Anambra State endorsed the activities of the """"Bakassi Boys"""" - an Igbo vigilante group ostensibly set up to combat crime, but which was responsible for killing several dozen Hausa Muslims in Aba, Abia State and Owerri, Imo State, in reprisal for the killing of Igbos during the Kaduna riots in February 2000 - and stated that they had been renamed the """"Onitsha vigilante services."""" Although Minister of Police Affairs David Jemibiwon spoke out against the Bakassi Boys and other militias following this statement, he later seemed to back down from his position.   Soldiers and police have also committed serious human rights violations in the course of responding to intercommunal violence, including extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, and extortion.  Constitutional Reform  In many ways, the lack of consensus on the legitimacy of the 1999 constitution is the fundamental problem facing Nigeria. The interim government of General Abdusalami Abubakar promulgated the constitution that is currently in force in Nigeria only three weeks before the new government was inaugurated on May 29, 1999. This followed an unrepresentative drafting process that took place virtually without consultation with the Nigerian people. The 1999 constitution was finalized by a panel appointed by General Abubakar and adopted by the military Provisional Ruling Council. There is widespread agreement among Nigerian politicians and civil society organizations that the process by which the constitution was adopted was illegitimate and that the arrangements in relation to a number of crucial areas, including human rights and the rule of law, the structure of the Nigerian federation and the system for revenue allocation and resource management, are not acceptable.   The letter of the constitution also raises a number of human rights concerns. For example, section 315(5) of the constitution provides that """"Nothing in the constitution shall invalidate"""" a set of laws, including the controversial National Security Agencies Act and Land Use Act, which in addition can only be repealed or amended by a special majority of the National Assembly and Senate. Section 6 of the National Security Agencies Act provides that the president may make any law to confer powers on the Defence Intelligence Agency, the National Intelligence Agency and the State Security Services. The Land Use Act provides the government with an extraordinary and often arbitrary degree of control over land; its repeal is one of the central demands of groups protesting the conditions of oil production in the Niger Delta area. As a result of section 315(5) of the constitution, the constitutionality of these laws cannot be challenged in any court of law.   The 1999 constitution also created novel political and funding problems for the judiciary. The constitution creates a National Judicial Council, which is to collect and disburse funds meant for the judiciary. It is also charged with recommending nominees to be appointed as federal or state judges - a provision that has caused a great deal of controversy. Nigeria is a federation of states, but the judges of the state high courts are to be selected by a federal body, which is also to fund the operations of state courts. This constitutional provision has created a constitutional anomaly that in effect """"federalizes"""" state judiciaries. At the present time, the National Judicial Council is yet to become operational and the state judiciaries continue to be funded by the respective state governments.   The current Nigerian government did establish a thirty-person interparty committee to review the 1999 constitution, but it has been much criticized by political leaders and civil society groups for its vague mandate and unrepresentative composition. The committee has ten representatives from each of the three registered political parties, namely the ruling People's Democratic Party, the All Peoples' Party, and the Alliance for Democracy, all appointed by President Obasanjo on the recommendation of party leaders. The committee was then split into six teams which conducted """"public hearings"""" in various state capitals in the six geo-political zones across Nigeria, in addition to meetings with the respective state legislatures and governors. The committee's resources were limited and it did not effectively publicize its activities, and as a result there was virtually no public participation in the """"hearings."""" The committee has gradually disappeared into oblivion. No public information is presently available as to whether the committee produced any report and senior government officials no longer refer to the committee in public.   On May 23, 2000, in a joint session of the two houses of the National Assembly, the Senate president announced the formation of a forty-two person constitutional review committee. The committee made little progress during the legislative session, and the National Assembly has announced that it would make constitutional reform a priority in the new legislative session which began on July 13. Civil society organizations are responding with initiatives and coalitions to coordinate input to the process and promote popular participation.  The Electoral System  Related to the constitutional issues, and also fundamental to many of the problems still facing Nigeria, are failings in the electoral system. If members of the National Assembly and state assemblies are not genuinely representative of their constituencies, then they are unable to negotiate solutions to political problems that will be accepted as legitimate. Although observers of the elections conducted in late 1998 and early 1999 welcomed their largely peaceful conclusion, they also concluded that they were deeply flawed. Allegations of ballot stuffing, vastly inflated tallies of voter turnout and blatant purchasing of votes were rife.   Political exclusion and a lack of minority representation constitute significant problems. In addition, the current electoral regulations require all political groups and associations, whether they are contesting local, state, or federal elections, to be registered as political parties by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) before they can be accorded recognition as political entities or present candidates. The electoral regulations expressly prohibit parties formed on regional, ethnic, and religious lines and require parties to have offices in at least twenty-four of the thirty-six states of Nigeria. They do not allow independent candidates, and provide for a screening process for party candidates on grounds of """"security."""" The registration criteria impose extremely arduous financial burdens as a result of which many persons or groups willing to engage in political activity cannot officially participate in electoral politics or present candidates for election. For example, the left-of-center party Democratic Alternative was unable to raise funds to set up offices in twenty-four state capitals in Nigeria, as a result of which it was not registered. The implication of this financial burden is that wealthy political bosses and former military officers who have substantial private resources and can afford to engage in political activities dominate the three political parties.   These requirements were justified by the government as necessary to promote national unity and prevent the formation of parties based on regional, ethnic or religious divisions. While this is a legitimate object, its practical effect is to restrict minority group participation in elections. For example, political groups representing the small Ogoni ethnic group such as MOSOP, which has a platform of securing local ownership of oil resources in Ogoniland, Rivers State, will not be able to build the cross-ethnic alliances needed to meet the electoral commission's requirements since their agenda is not one acceptable to the leaders of the larger ethnic groups in Nigeria. The result is that the political parties are very weak, and are effectively no more than agglomerations of often divergent interest groups and factions with no discernable political program. The security screening process carried out by the IEC is not based on reasonable and transparent criteria and has resulted in the exclusion of outspoken individuals likely to challenge the status quo rather than fulfilling any legitimate purpose. Many Nigerians who wish to participate in politics are shut out by these regulations.  Nigeria in Sierra Leone  Nigerian troops have played an important military role in Sierra Leone since February 1998, when they intervened under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. They currently form a key component of the peacekeeping forces of the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), with some 3,213 soldiers deployed, the largest component of the UNAMSIL forces (just larger than the Indian contingent). The U.N. Security Council is currently discussing a new mandate for UNAMSIL, and the possibility of the deployment of an even larger contingent of troops from ECOWAS countries, largely Nigerians, within an expanded force. The Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone have played a very important role and have undoubtedly protected many civilians from falling victim to the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). However, there are concerns in relation to human rights issues. Human Rights Watch has documented serious abuses by Nigerian forces serving under ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, including summary executions of suspected rebels and their collaborators, extortion, brutality and excessive use of force. Increasing the likelihood of abuse is the fact that Nigerian troops are not rotated out of Sierra Leone sufficiently often to allow for recovery from the very difficult posting, nor are their salaries paid regularly. Some Nigerian soldiers are only now going home after serving on active duty in Liberia and Sierra Leone for almost three years without home leave.   In August 2000, the U.S. announced that it would send at least a hundred U.S. Special Forces to Nigeria to train and equip up to five Nigerian battalions for UNAMSIL, part of a total of seven battalions from West Africa. Training is currently underway for the first battalion, with other battalions being reviewed for possible inclusion, and is expected to last at least a couple of months. The cost is expected to be U.S.$20 million. The U.S. has stated that it is vetting the Nigerian battalions in compliance with the Leahy law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if there is credible evidence that the units have committed gross human rights abuses. The training will include training in combat, peacekeeping, and counterinsurgency, in addition to human rights and humanitarian law education. The equipment to be provided will include Belgian FN rifles, mortars and communication equipment, but not heavy artillery or tanks. However, no provisions have been made for monitoring the conduct of these battalions once they are deployed or ensuring that any soldiers responsible for human rights abuses will be held accountable.  Recommendations to the U.S. Government  The reestablishment of civilian rule in Nigeria offers a real hope that the country can take its rightful place as a leader in Africa and that its citizens can enjoy the respect for human rights to which they are entitled. However, the government faces huge obstacles in achieving this goal in the face of the pattern of widespread and systematic abuse that it has inherited from its predecessors. In particular, the government, or elements within it, may be tempted to respond violently to the discontent in the Niger Delta, a response that could catastrophically reverse progress towards respect for human rights in Nigeria as a whole. The U.S. government can play an important role in supporting legal and practical reforms by the Nigerian government through technical assistance and constructive diplomatic efforts in relation to the issues raised in this document, and by assisting civil society organizations working towards increased respect for human rights. Nigerian human rights groups have welcomed the pro-democracy measures that have been supported, while expressing concern at the hiring, in some cases, of U.S.-based organizations and consultants to carry out work that could be done by Nigerian groups. Particular concerns arise in connection with the areas mentioned below.  Security Sector Assistance  With the restoration of civilian rule, the U.S. government has resumed military assistance to Nigeria. As a first priority in giving such assistance, the U.S. should seek to assist the Nigerian executive and legislature in building a culture of independent civilian oversight of the security forces and intelligence agencies. The U.S. government should encourage the Nigerian government to accept this principle as a means of establishing the legitimacy of civilian authority. U.S. military assistance given to Nigeria, including under the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, should include strict human rights conditions. In particular, the U.S. government should put in place screening procedures to ensure that military, intelligence, and police officers who committed human rights abuses under previous military regimes do not benefit from U.S. training programs. Human rights training should be integrated into all programs. U.S.AID support for network of civil society groups working on security sector reform should be increased.   The U.S. government and especially the U.S. Embassy in Lagos, should implement Section 570 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, the so-called Leahy amendment, in relation to Nigeria, and should monitor military units that receive U.S. military aid. The Leahy amendment prohibits funds from being provided to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the secretary of state has credible evidence that the unit has committed gross violations of human rights, unless the secretary determines and reports to Congress that the government involved is taking effective measures to bring the responsible members of the security forces unit to justice. It requires the embassy to monitor all security forces that have received, or may receive, U.S. security assistance. In this context, support for the Oputa commission's investigations into past abuses and for even-handed prosecutions of military officials and others based on information received by the commission, could be of particular importance.   Similar issues arise in relation to U.S. assistance for Nigeria's police force. While there is a clear need for the Nigerian police to achieve a higher standard of training and operations, any U.S. assistance in this regard should be subject to careful conditions. In particular, any assistance must be developed in consultation with Nigerian civil society including the network of NGOs working on police reform. This assistance should begin with support for radical reform of the police, including the drafting of new legislation to replace the colonial law that currently regulates policing. The U.S. government should also press for greater accountability for abuses, as well as for judicial reform, and the rooting out of rampant police corruption. If U.S. training is offered, individuals receiving training should be screened, in discussion with Nigerian human rights groups, to ensure that well-known abusers are not among them, and the content of training should be focused on skills aimed at reducing the use of force.   According to testimony to the House Foreign Relations Committee Subcommittee on Africa in August 1999 by Dave Miller, a representative of the private Corporate Council for Africa, U.S. oil companies are considering funding modest efforts to provide training and nonlethal support for Nigeria police officials with responsibility for their area of operations. While he also stated that any comprehensive retraining of the Nigerian police force in modern methods and techniques needs the legitimacy and scope of a government-to-government or other international program, any initiative in relation to assistance for the security forces should be fully transparent and take into account the concerns we have raised here. In the context of the current situation in the Niger Delta, there is a clear danger that training and other assistance provided by U.S. oil companies to Nigerian police units engaged in policing the area may be viewed as support for repressive forces by the local population, resulting in an increased risk to oil company personnel in the region.  The Niger Delta  The U.S. government must make clear to the Nigerian government that any attempt to resolve the issues confronting the Niger Delta through the violent suppression of popular protest rather than political dialogue will be condemned by the international community. The U.S. should urge the Nigerian government, among other steps, to institute an immediate, inclusive and transparent process of negotiation with freely chosen representatives of the peoples living in the Niger Delta to resolve the issues surrounding the production of oil and the operations of the Niger Delta Development Commission.   The U.S. government should urge the Nigerian government to take steps to replace soldiers carrying out policing duties in the Niger Delta area and elsewhere with regular police with training in public order policing and ensure that those police deployed have been vetted to exclude abusive officers. The U.S. government and the oil companies should not provide assistance to any special police units for the Niger Delta.   The U.S. government initiative on corporate responsibility and human rights in the oil industry in Nigeria is welcome and should be supported. Systematic monitoring and protest of human rights violations by the government, and steps to ensure that the companies themselves are not complicit in such human rights violations, are more important than ever.  Sierra Leone and ECOMOG  The U.S. government should commend President Obasanjo for the continued support given by the Nigerian government to UNAMSIL, the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone. It is important that Nigerian troops remain under the U.N. umbrella, to ensure that they can be effective and that the different contingents within UNAMSIL can be coordinated. In addition, the Nigerian government should follow through with its commitment to investigate abuses committed by ECOMOG soldiers during the January 1999 rebel offensive in Freetown, as promised at the April 1999 ECOWAS summit, and to bring to justice, in accordance with international standards, all those found responsible for violations. To reduce the likelihood of future abuses, steps should be taken to provide human rights education, and to ensure regular rotation of Nigerian soldiers serving in Sierra Leone and that pay and other conditions are satisfactory. The Nigerian government should investigate allegations that officers deployed to Sierra Leone have been involved in illegal diamond mining for personal profit, and take appropriate steps to bring to justice any officers against whom there is evidence of wrongdoing.   With the U.S. now directly involved in training West African troops, it is imperative that mechanisms be put in place for ongoing monitoring of their conduct in the field and ensuring accountability if abuses occur. The U.S. should request regular reporting from ECOWAS and the U.N. about the adherence of these troops to international standards and any future efforts to hold soldiers accountable for abuses. In addition, the U.S. should press the Nigerian goverment and ECOWAS to conduct the promised investigation of ECOMOG abuses during January 1999.

These allegations are serious and warrant prompt and thorough investigation. We urge you to conduct a full-scale inquiry without delay. The Philadelphia authorities have an obligation to ensure that police officers and other city personnel who have used excessive force or otherwise violated individuals' rights are held fully accountable and prosecuted or disciplined. Human Rights Watch recognizes the responsibility of the police to uphold law and order, and in no way condones violence by protesters. Those who assault police officers or others should be prosecuted appropriately. Unlawful actions by some protesters, however, cannot justify excessive use of force by police officers when carrying out arrests or inhumane or brutal treatment of those held in detention. Many appear to have been arrested and detained without cause, simply because they were taking a photograph, walking near a demonstration site or working as legal observers or as medics attending to injured protesters. Detainees stated that they were denied telephone calls, with some not allowed to make even one call while detained for several days. Others claim they requested but were denied medical treatment while in jail and that they were not provided with medication they required. The following are among cases of concern to Human Rights Watch, and are examples of the types of complaints reported by many protesters: On the afternoon of August 1, some thirty protesters, all handcuffed, were held for approximately seven hours in a bus although it was poorly ventilated and temperatures outside were high. According to several sources, those detained in the bus were not provided with water for some hours, despite their protests, and then were given only a small amount. As the bus became overheated, several of the detainees became faint. One, a heavy-set man nicknamed Slim, slumped in his seat and appeared to have fainted. Others called for him to receive medical attention, and he was roughly dragged from the bus, hitting his body on the seats and other items. He was placed on the ground outside, lying on his still handcuffed wrists. The other detainees continued to be held in the bus for several hours more, during which they received only a small amount of water.  Several instances of alleged police brutality were reported. For example, one of the legal observers was allegedly attacked by police officers on August 2 when he tried to photograph an arrest. He states that he was pushed into a brick wall and had his face pushed against the pavement by officers. As a result, he sustained facial injuries and was taken to a hospital hours later. There, his wounds were bandaged and he received a prescription, but the accompanying police officers did not fill the prescription and the man went without medication. In another case, a man who was videotaping bicycle officers in a staging area at 1200 Race Street at about 1pm on August 2, was allegedly assaulted by two or three officers who ran at him, knocked the camera from his hand, and banged his head into a cement ledge and concrete curb. Other officers yelled to those apprehending the man to smash the camera, which they did. While he was on the ground and handcuffed, he alleges that police first sprayed him with pepper spray and then one officer sprayed water into his nose and mouth, presumably to offset the spray's effect. Another officer then approached and reportedly said """"get him with this, we all just pissed in it."""" The man could not smell or taste anything because of the effects of the spray, but the liquid was warm and could have been urine. He was taunted verbally and repeatedly called a """"pussy."""" He was taken to the 23rd District stationhouse, where he asked to see a doctor because his head had been injured by officers during his arrest, but he was not given treatment. Many complainants cite overly harsh treatment at the Roundhouse and at the 23rd District holding area and accuse police and facility personnel of dragging detained protesters along the floor, bumping them into walls, and threatening them. Some were forced into contorted positions by being handcuffed from one wrist to the opposite ankle, and those who complained that their or others' handcuffs were too tight and painfully cutting off circulation were sometimes singled out for rough treatment and threats. Several were held for days without being allowed to make a telephone call, medications and treatment were denied to those who had been injured or required them for other ailments, and some single cells were used to hold as many as eight detainees.  One detainee who was held at the Roundhouse reported seeing a naked male protester there being dragged by the neck and hair on August 3, banged against a wall, having his throat trodden upon by a plainclothes officer; the same naked male reportedly had his penis pulled by a female officer. Another demonstrator, who was held for four nights at the Roundhouse, reported that between six and ten guards entered the cells around midnight and again before dawn to remove detainees who were refusing to cooperate with the authorities by withholding their names. These, they proceeded to kick, beat and push into walls in full view of the other detainees, apparently in order to intimidate them. While many disputes relating to police tactics will no doubt be pursued through the judicial system, we note that city officials have not provided any adequate explanation as to why alleged protest organizers were arrested while simply walking in the street or speaking into cell phones or for the arrests of those at the Haverford and 41st Street warehouse. The latter, we are informed, were engaged in making puppets and other protest art inside the building and yet some were charged with """"blocking a highway"""". What, we wonder, was the legal justification for the raid on the warehouse, and why did the police consider it necessary to arrest all those present? We believe that these, and other, allegations of brutality and excessively harsh treatment, including the excessive bail amounts set for many of those arrested, send a chilling message to those who wish to express their views and exercise their right to free speech. We urge you to investigate all allegations of excessive force promptly and fairly, and to hold those officers responsible accountable. We urge you to treat those who remain in custody humanely and to ensure that excessive force is not used against them. We also urge the Police Advisory Commission to review individual cases of alleged abuse and to examine the police policies and practices surrounding actions against these protesters. We look forward to your reply. Sincerely, /s/ Allyson Collins Washington Associate Director","United States",""

The international monitoring organization called for a judicial inquiry into the attacks and urged all parties to the conflict in the disputed territory to respect the rights of civilians under international humanitarian law. The recent attacks on Hindus in Kashmir are a reminder of the continued failure by all parties to protect civilian non-combatants,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"Just as we have condemned abuses against civilians at the hands of the Indian security forces, we oppose violations of international humanitarian law by militant groups."""" The Geneva Conventions, she noted, prohibit acts of violence against civilians who are not taking an active part in hostilities in internal armed conflicts.  On Saturday night, a group of men armed with assault rifles entered two houses in the village of Ind, located 10 km north of the town of Gool in Udhampur district. According to press reports, they opened fire on the occupants, killing three elderly men and a teenage boy, and critically injuring two others. Two nights earlier, another group of gunmen had raided several Hindu homes in the village of Kot Dara, about 10km from the town of Rajouri, and fired upon the residents. Six persons were killed in that attack, and six others injured. In a separate incident on Sunday, a gunman shot a member of the Kashmir Valley's dwindling Hindu minority at a long-distance dialing kiosk that he operated in Qazi Gund, near the town of Anantnag. The victim, Prithvi Nath, was hospitalized with injuries sustained in the attack.  The slayings this weekend follow the mass killings of Hindus in different parts of the state earlier this month. On August 1 and 2, gunmen killed a total of nearly ninety persons in separate attacks on Hindu pilgrims at Pahalgam in the Kashmir Valley; predominantly Hindu migrant laborers at a brick-kiln factory in Qazi Gund and in a neighboring village; and local Hindus in Doda, immediately south of the Valley. Although the massacres were condemned by most major separatist political parties and armed groups active in Kashmir, they are believed to have been carried out by militant factions opposed to peace talks then underway between Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, Kashmir's largest armed guerilla group, and the Indian government.  No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks this past weekend. Although in each case local Hindu residents were selectively targeted, local observers and media have speculated that there may have been different motives for the different incidents. Some of the persons killed in the attack on homes in Kot Dara were reported to have been members of the local Village Defense Committee (VDC), an institution established by the state government in the hill districts. The VDCs, ostensibly set up to guarantee the safety of all of the region's inhabitants, have recruited their members almost exclusively from local Hindu communities and are seen by militants as adjuncts to the Indian security forces. The attempted killing in Qazi Gund came two days after the state cabinet approved a controversial proposal for the resettlement of displaced Hindus, most of whom had fled their homes in the Kashmir Valley in 1990, into three new """"safe"""" zones in the Valley.","Asia, India",""

This execution would be the fifth of a juvenile offender nationwide this year, and the first such execution in Georgia since 1993. International human rights law flatly prohibits the execution of a person for a crime he or she committed when under the age of 18. This international prohibition on the execution of juvenile offenders reflects the reality that children are different than adults. They lack an adult's experience, perspective, judgment, maturity, and restraint. With help, even the most errant may be rehabilitated. But the United States is out of step with international consensus. It is one of only two nations that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child --- the other is Somalia, which lacks a functioning government. Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, a total of 17 juvenile offenders have been put to death. Approximately 70 more now sit on death row. No other nation in the world comes close to this shameful record, making the United States the worldwide leader in juvenile executions. In fact, the only other countries known to execute juvenile offenders are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Congo. China and Yemen, among the last holdouts, banned juvenile executions in 1997. The Supreme Court last addressed the constitutionality of executing juvenile offenders in 1989. In its decision in Stanford v. Kentucky, the court found that imposing the death penalty on 16- and 17-year-old offenders was not contrary to """"evolving standards of decency"""" because there was no national consensus against the execution of juvenile offenders. Thus, the """"standard of decency"""" of almost every other country is higher than that of the United States when it comes to the death penalty. But a national consensus against the juvenile death penalty is emerging. Today, of the 38 states that retain the death penalty, 15 states and the federal system restrict the death penalty to adult offenders. Georgia and four other states prohibit the execution of offenders who were 16 or younger at the time of their crimes. Last year, Montana abolished the death penalty for those younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the imposition of the death penalty on 16-year-old offenders was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the state constitution. Abolishing the death penalty for juvenile offenders would not excuse them of criminal responsibility. Those who are convicted can be imprisoned for life. Life imprisonment is sufficient to express society's outrage at horrible crimes, to hold offenders accountable and to protect society from further violence. Even for adults, being guilty of a capital crime is not enough to warrant the death penalty. U.S. law reserves it only for the most blameworthy offenders, based on consideration of their background, character, motivation, and the circumstances of their crimes. Adolescents simply cannot meet that standard of blameworthiness. As the Supreme Court recognized when it struck down the death penalty for 15-year-olds in 1988, """"The reasons why juveniles are not trusted with the privileges and responsibilities of an adult also explain why their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult."""" Putting to death those who were minors at the time of their crimes and also suffer from mental illness violates the most basic principles of justice and morality. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles should take the first step to uphold these standards by commuting Alexander William's sentence to life in prison. The legislature should follow by prohibiting the death penalty for juvenile offenders.","United States","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

The execution would be the fifth of a juvenile offender nationwide this year and the first such execution in Georgia since 1993. The United States has not executed five adolescent offenders in a single year since 1954. A total of seventeen juvenile offenders have been put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Approximately seventy more now sit on death row; three, including Williams, are in Georgia. """"What's shocking about these executions is that they're becoming routine,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It should be out of the question for a mentally ill person to face the electric chair for a crime he committed as a teenager."""" International law prohibits capital punishment for offenses committed below the age of eighteen. Other than the United States, the only countries known to execute juvenile offenders are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Williams' execution also raises concerns because his mental illness and history of child abuse were never presented to the jury.

The organization called upon President Clinton, who travels to Colombia on August 30, to urge Colombian authorities to take swift and effective action to satisfy the law's human rights conditions.  In several hours of discussions with State Department officials undertaken on August 17 and 18 as part of the aid package's consultation requirement, Human Rights Watch and other leading human rights groups detailed, provision by provision, the Colombian government's failure to meet the human rights conditions of the package.  """"Not a single one of the five human rights provisions contained in the legislation has been satisfied,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"It would be inconceivable, given Colombia's glaring human rights failings, for the State Department to grant certification. From my discussions with them, I believe they understand this.""""  One of the key conditions is the enforcement of the 1997 Constitutional Court ruling that armed forces personnel alleged to have committed human rights violations be prosecuted in civilian courts. The military court system, notorious for shielding military perpetrators of abuse from justice, poses a crucial obstacle to the effective prosecution of human rights crimes. As Human Rights Watch pointed out in its meetings with the State Department, military officers who have committed serious abuses are routinely acquitted and dozens of prominent human rights cases remain in impunity. Meanwhile, high-ranking officers who maintain close ties to paramilitary killers remain in command of troops. To date, Colombian President Pastrana has not even issued a directive to the military to obey the Constitutional Court, another specific requirement of the U.S. legislation.  If the State Department denies human rights rights certification, President Clinton can only grant the aid if he invokes the law's """"national security interest"""" waiver. Human Rights Watch believes that the use of such a waiver would be a grave error.  """"A waiver that ignores Colombia's dismal human rights situation would send a clear message to the Colombian government and its security forces that U.S. commitment to human rights does not go beyond rhetoric,"""" warned Vivanco. """"After all of the debate in Congress over human rights, it would be downright irresponsible.""""  Human Rights Watch believes that the Clinton Administration's goal, instead of granting the aid, should be to work with the Colombian authorities to satisfy the conditions in the legislation.

A constitutional amendment passed today by the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly makes it far less likely that former President Soeharto or any army officer could be charged with crimes against humanity for any atrocities committed by Indonesian troops from 1965 to the present. Amendment 28(1) invokes the principle of non-retroactivity, meaning that no one can be charged with a crime that did not constitute an offense in law at the time it was committed. Since Indonesian law has no provision for crimes against humanity, the most serious charge that anyone involved in the scorched earth campaign in East Timor or the atrocities in Aceh could face is murder ?at least in an Indonesian court. """"Crimes against humanity are so serious that non-retroactivity doesn't usually apply to them,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"This is the prevailing trend in international law, and Indonesian judges should go along with it."""" Human Rights Watch said the new amendment had several immediate ramifications: 1) It could mean that the Indonesian masterminds of the 1999 violence in East Timor will be judged less harshly than rank-and-file militia members. The operating assumption up until now has been that perpetrators of crimes against humanity would be tried either by an international panel of the Dili district court, with international judges working alongside East Timorese colleagues, or by courts in Jakarta. Senior Indonesian army officers are unlikely to be extradited to East Timor. This would mean that if and when the Indonesian Attorney-General succeeds in bringing to trial the army officers who orchestrated the Timor destruction, they would be tried for the common crime of murder, while their East Timorese followers could face charges of crimes against humanity under East Timorese law. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has said repeatedly that if the Indonesian courts proved not up to the task of holding the perpetrators of the violence in East Timor accountable, the question of an international tribunal could be reopened. 2) The bill on a human rights court now under discussion in parliament could be rendered weaker than it already is. The bill would set up a human rights court for trying serious human rights offenses, including crimes against humanity, and for the first time would incorporate provisions on the latter into Indonesian law. The proposed court will only be able to try suspects whose crimes were committed after the law takes effect. But the bill also allows the Indonesian president to set up ad hoc human rights courts for specific cases, such as the human rights abuses committed over the last decade in Aceh. Those ad hoc courts, as the bill now stands, would not be bound by the non-retroactivity principle. That will likely change with the new amendment. The bill will be debated and passed in some form next month. Human Rights Watch called on everyone concerned about accountability in Indonesia to work toward four goals. They should publicize international standards relating to crimes against humanity. They should work for a revised amendment in next year's session of the People's Consultative Assembly to explicitly exempt crimes against humanity and similar grave international crimes from the non-retroactivity provision. They should work for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty that would impose important rights obligations on Indonesia. And they should get other countries to gather evidence and bring indictments against suspected Indonesian human rights violators, following the Pinochet precedent.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Clashes with Islamic fighters broke out August 7 in Surkhandarya. They widened on August 11, as Tajikistan-based fighters attacked the Batken district of Kyrgyzstan?50 kilometers northeast of Surkhandarya?located near the Tajik-Kyrgyz border. The fighters were seeking to enter Uzbekistan from the north.  """"This is an internal armed conflict, and there are rules that apply to protect civilians,"""" said Rachel Denber, Acting Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"All parties to this conflict have to do everything to avoid civilian casualties. Now that air strikes are involved, the risk to civilian lives is even greater.""""  No civilian casualties have been reported so far. There are no reliable casualties figures for government troops and insurgents.  This is the second time in a year that political violence has seized Central Asia. Last August a group of armed militants attacked Batken, seizing hostages whom they eventually released. In Uzbekistan, government forces have regained control over several villages in the Surkhandarya province and begun mop-up operations to arrest those suspected of supporting or participating in the armed conflict. """"This is another major human rights concern,"""" said Ms. Denber. """"Uzbekistan has an ugly record of arbitrary arrests and torturing people in custody."""" In the past two years, in response to several security emergencies, the Uzbek government has arrested thousands of men for """"religious extremism,"""" distributing religious leaflets, and membership in banned religious organizations. Arrests have targeted people who prayed in mosques not run by the government; sentences range from fifteen to twenty years in prison. Last week, Fakhriddin Tursunov, head of the Tashkent region's directorate of the National Security Service (SNB), exhorted the public to help police find """"supporters of the terrorists,"""" and """"distributors of leaflets."""" """"There is a big difference between taking legitimate steps to protect state security and marching someone off to prison for fifteen years because he might have religious leaflets,"""" said Ms. Denber.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

The Chin are an ethnic and religious minority in north-western Burma. According to local sources, police in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram are preparing to deport another group of Chin this Friday. Last week authorities turned over more than one hundred Chin to the Burmese army along the border and have detained more than 1,000 others pending deportation. The Indian government claims the Chin are illegal immigrants.  """"Any wholesale deportation to Burma without safeguards for protecting genuine refugees is unacceptable,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The general level of repression in Burma should be enough to justify those safeguards. But when the deportees belong to an ethnic minority, and the Burmese army is conducting counterinsurgency operations near their homes, protection becomes absolutely vital.""""  The Indian government should give the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees immediate access to the detainees, she said, so that anyone with a valid fear of persecution could make a formal claim for refugee status.  At the moment, not only is there no presence of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, but there is even concern that local officials may be ignoring the applicable law, which requires that any potential deportee have a judicial hearing.  Mizoram State borders on Burma's Chin State, where the Chin National Front (CNF) has been fighting the Burmese government since 1988. Anyone the government suspects of having links to the rebels can face arbitrary arrest, detention, and, at times, torture. Villagers are subject to forced labor, forced portering, and religious persecution, as many of the Chin are Christians.  Though some ethnic minority Chin have been in India since the 1960s, most of the Chin refugees now in India fled there to escape abuses after 1988, when the Burmese government violently cracked down on the pro-democracy movement. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Chin now live in Mizoram alone. Since the Chin have no access to relief assistance, they are forced to survive by seeking work, particularly around Mizoram's capital, Aizawl. Work as migrant laborers exposes Chin refugees to arrest and expulsion for illegal entry.  The Indian government has not signed the 1951 U.N. Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, nor does it have any domestic refugee law. The Foreigners Act, under which the Chin are being expelled, makes no distinction between illegal immigrants and refugees. The Indian government is, however, bound by the international principle of non-refoulement which prohibits the forcible return of refugees to situations in which they would be subject to persecution and where their lives and freedom could be threatened.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), India","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

If it fails to do so, donor countries should reinstitute the ban on commerical military sales to Indonesia imposed in September 1999 at the height of the army-led violence in East Timor. Militias, including men who could face charges of crimes against humanity for their role in murder, rape, arson, and forced displacement during the anti-independence campaign last year, have escalated operations in East Timor over the last month. Squad-sized units have crossed the border from West Timor, killing two peacekeepers and terrorizing the civilian population. Concern is mounting that more deaths may take place as the anniversary approaches of the August 30, 1999 referendum that led to East Timor's separation from Indonesia. """"These raids are taking place under the nose of elite Indonesian troops,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"The militias are well-armed, well-organized, well-trained, and they've got apparently inexhaustible supplies of ammunition. If the army is not stopping them, that's because it's chosen not to do so."""" Jendrzejczyk said despite different theories about who was masterminding the militia activity -- Indonesian army headquarters in Jakarta, regional commanders, or a group of disaffected or disgraced officers linked to former President Soeharto – it was clear that Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, head of the Bali-based command that includes West Timor, could do far more than he was doing. At a minimum, he said, Syahnakri could be using his authority to systematically search known militia camps and residences for weapons and obtain evidence to detain militia members on suspicion of illegal possession of firearms while further investigations proceed.  Some sources have suggested that Syahnakri is unwilling to act for fear of causing riots in the militia-controlled camps in West Timor, where pro-integration feelings run high, or for fear that his troops might have to fire on militia members who themselves were the creation of the army. """"The Indonesian army is doing just what it did in East Timor from January to September 1999,"""" said Jendrzejczyk – """"standing by and doing nothing while serious abuses take place.""""  He said that donors should insist that the militia be put out of business prior to the next World Bank-convened donor conference on Indonesia, scheduled to take place in October in Tokyo, Japan. Since mid-July, dozens, perhaps hundreds of militia members operating from bases in West Timor have crossed into East Timor in groups of ten to fifteen men. A New Zealand soldier was shot and killed on July 24, a Nepalese soldier on August 11. Most of the incursions have been into the East Timorese border districts of Covalima and Bobonaro, but militia members have reached the interior provinces of Ermera and Ainaro as well. As a result of last year's violence, the U.S., Australia, and the European Union imposed a ban on commercial military sales to Indonesia. The E.U. lifted the ban in January 2000, allowing each member country to decide itself whether or not to resume sales. The United Kingdom, for example, has resumed delivery of Hawk aircraft. Last year, the U.S. Congress adopted legislation prohibiting direct sales of military equipment to Indonesia, but commercial sales were not covered by the law. The Clinton administration stopped such sales in September 1999, but the administration is now consulting Congress about selling some spare parts and equipment.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","Arms"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/16/letter-un-secretary-general-kofi-annan-principles-justice-sierra-leone","Letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Principles of Justice in Sierra Leone","Letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Principles of Justice in Sierra Leone ","","08/16/2000","Dear Mr. Secretary-General,     Human Rights Watch welcomes the commitment shown by the Security Council on August 14, 2000, to bringing the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious human rights abuses in Sierra Leone to justice (S/RES/1315). The resolution has asked you to send a team of experts to Sierra Leone and to submit a report with recommendations to the Security Council within thirty days.      Human Rights Watch believes that the effectiveness of this justice effort will to a significant degree be determined by the framework for the court to be proposed by the team of experts. Human Rights Watch believes that justice and the ending of the culture of impunity in Sierra Leone are of paramount importance for the peace process and the country's overall future. A justice effort, to be meaningful and to produce lasting results, must be credible and legitimate. The criminal responsibility of all abusive parties must be assessed, including those of the RUF's former allies, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and dissident factions of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA).     A """"mixed"""" tribunal, as proposed by the Security Council, presents unique challenges which were not faced by the tribunals created for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Human Rights Watch welcomes a participatory role for the Sierra Leone authorities in the proposed Sierra Leone court, in the hope that Sierra Leone's participation in the proposed court will lead to more tangible justice for the people of Sierra Leone and a strengthening of the judicial institutions of that country. However, the proposed court must be carefully designed to prevent political manipulation of the judicial process and a denigration of the rights of the accused. In order to ensure that the justice effort in Sierra Leone is broad-based, unbiased, and fair, the international community will need to play a significant, and not just a supportive, role in the proposed tribunal. Note must also be taken of the weakened state of the Sierra Leone judiciary, a fact recognized by the Sierra Leone government itself, which must of necessity limit the role the country can play in an international criminal tribunal.     We consider the following to be the minimal acceptable principles for such a justice effort. As you embark on the negotiations, we call on you to commit the United Nations to these principles.     Legal Basis of the Proceedings:   The court's jurisdiction, competence, fair trial guarantees, rules of procedure, and evidence should be drawn from international standards including, where appropriate, precedents of the two existing ad hoc international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The Court must enjoy and be seen to enjoy full independence and to operate with impartiality.     Organization of the Court:   An effective justice effort would require sufficient judicial resources to allow for the timely disposition of trials, and provision for independent appellate review.     Personnel:   It is essential for the credibility of the process that the judges, prosecutors,   and staff be individuals of high moral character, impartiality, and integrity who possess experience in criminal and international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.     Subject Matter Jurisdiction:   As per paragraph 2 of Resolution 1315, the court should be given jurisdiction not only over crimes defined in the Sierra Leonean criminal code such as murder, battery, torture, kidnaping, and rape, but also over crimes subject to universal jurisdiction under international law, including crimes against humanity, war crimes and others serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The definitions of these crimes should be drawn from the statute of the International Criminal Court and the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.     Temporal Jurisdiction:   Human Rights Watch strongly believes that the court should be given jurisdiction over crimes committed at least since March 1991, when the RUF launched a rebellion to overthrow the Sierra Leonean government; and that the court's jurisdiction should be ongoing until the Security Council declares that the conflict no longer poses a threat to international security, as is the case with the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.     Broad-based and Inclusive Justice:   The process established must focus on the criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed by all sides to the conflict in Sierra Leone, and not only on the responsibility of Foday Sankoh and other RUF leaders.     Protection of Witnesses and Personnel:   Programs must be established for the protection of witnesses and the security of all other participants, including judges and lawyers as well as investigators and defendants and prisoners. This protection must be available from the earliest investigatory stage through post-trial measures. In particular, the court must be able to take security measures to protect witnesses and victims and their families from reprisals. Such measures must not prejudice the rights of suspects and accused.     Fair Trial and Due Process:   The court should ensure the highest international standards of fair trial and due process at all stages of the proceedings. Particularly given the collapse and consequent mistrust of official institutions in Sierra Leone, justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done. Therefore, the tribunal must be scrupulous in its respect of international standards including according to Articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Universal Declaration); and Articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).     Circumstances of Arrest and Conditions of Confinement:   No one should be subject to arbitrary arrest and detention in contravention of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration and Article 9 of the ICCPR. All prisoners should be treated humanely in accordance with Article 10 of the ICCPR; the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment; and Articles 7 and 15 of the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.     Death Penalty:   There should be no provision for the death penalty, which is an inherently cruel punishment under all circumstances.     Pardons and Amnesties:   Amnesties, which essentially erase the criminality of past acts from the record, should be barred. If exceptional circumstances arise in which the granting of an individual pardon is contemplated, the extreme seriousness of the offenses should be taken into account so as not to undermine the decisions of the courts and rob the whole effort of legitimacy.     Financing:   The international community should provide adequate financial support to ensure the effective and timely functioning of the justice effort. The international community should provide support for the reconstruction and capacity-building of the Sierra Leone justice system, including the training of judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and administrative support staff.     Cooperation:   The Sierra Leonean government, the United Nations, and its member states must agree to give their complete cooperation with the justice effort and comply with court resolutions and orders, such as opening files, ordering the arrest of suspects, ensuring full cooperation with all aspects of the investigation and the arrest of suspects, and allowing staff to appear before the court.     Mr. Secretary-General,     We know of your strong commitment to ending impunity in all parts of the world. We trust that you will personally assure the highest standards and the greatest integrity for the justice effort in Sierra Leone.     As usual, we stand ready to assist members of your staff with more information should it be deemed useful.     With best regards,       Peter Takirambudde   Executive Director, Africa Division     Joanna Weschler   U.N. Representative","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations"

Mr. Williams is a mentally ill inmate on death row for a crime he committed at the age of seventeen. If his death sentence is carried out, Mr. Williams will be the fifth juvenile offender nationwide to be put to death this year. His execution would be the first in Georgia since 1993 and only the second since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Georgia is obligated to refrain from executing adolescent offenders under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an international human rights treaty ratified by the United States. Although the United States purports to reserve the right to impose capital punishment on juvenile offenders, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the treaty body charged with interpreting the Covenant, has concluded that the U.S. reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and therefore void as a matter of international law.  The United States is one of only five countries that defy the international prohibition on executing juvenile offenders. The others are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudia Arabia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The international standard forbidding the execution of adolescent offenders reflects the reality that children are different from adults; that they lack the experience, perspective, judgment, and maturity, and restraint of an adult; and that with help even the most errant may be rehabilitated. Mr. William's mental illness and history of severe childhood abuse—facts which were never considered by the jury—are additional compelling reasons for the commutation of his sentence. U.S. law reserves capital punishment for the most blameworthy offenders, based on a careful consideration of their background, character, motivation, and the circumstances of their crimes. A person who was mentally ill and a child at the time of his crime can never meet the extraordinary level of blameworthiness that is required to impose a death sentence. As former First Lady Rosalynn Carter wrote to you last month, """"imposing the death penalty on mentally ill children should be unthinkable in a civilized society.""""  We urge the Board to uphold this basic principle of justice and morality by commuting Alexander Williams' sentence.","United States",""

""""But this court must not stop at prosecuting one man or faction. Diplomats keep talking about the ‘Sankoh resolution,' as if rebel leader Foday Sankoh were the only one responsible for the widespread war crimes in Sierra Leone.""""     The United Nations Security Council voted today to support the establishment of a criminal tribunal for Sierra Leone to prosecute """"persons who bear the greatest responsibility"""" for """"crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as crimes under relevant Sierra Leonean law, committed within the territory of Sierra Leone.""""

Human Rights Watch warned that the resolution did not actually establish the court, and that the effectiveness of the court would be determined by the yet-to-be-reached agreement between the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone.     The brutal nine-year civil war in Sierra Leone has been characterized by widespread human rights abuses. The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has been responsible for the summary killings, rape, and mutilation of thousands of Sierra Leone civilians. During its short occupation of Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, in January 1999, the RUF and its allies killed thousands of civilians and carried out mass amputations of the arms and legs of civilians. The Lome Peace Accords of July 1999 granted a blanket amnesty to all parties, but the RUF reignited the civil war in May 2000 by taking some 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage and renewing its abusive offensive against the Sierra Leone government.     Human Rights Watch expressed concern that a possible dominant role in the court by Sierra Leone authorities could lead to political manipulation of the process, leading to biased prosecutions and inadequate protections for persons standing trial before the tribunal. The Sierra Leone judiciary does not have the capacity to play more than a limited role in the court, a fact acknowledged by the Sierra Leone government itself, Human Rights Watch said. The rights group urged the U.N. Security Council to set up a credible, even-handed, and well-funded court with a strong international component.     """"Sierra Leone needs significant help of the international community to bring the main perpetrators of abuse to account,"""" argued Takirambudde.

Others are reportedly being subjected to harassment, including brief detentions. In particular, we learned that the Commander Mukalayi and the deputy commissioner for mines and energy Michel Rudatenguha were respectively arrested on July 27 and on July 29 by the RCD-ML's security services. The two officials are reportedly being held since their arrest in the Military training Center of Rwampara, not far from Bunia. They are reportedly locked up in a narrow pit where they are being subjected to daily beatings and denied access to visitors. Several young soldiers of the RCD-ML accused of mutiny, also detained at Rwampara center, are reportedly being subjected to similar treatment. Human Rights Watch appreciates your response to our telephone call on Friday, August 4. During that conversation, you confirmed that Mr. Rudatenguha was subject to investigations relating to his supposed role in the recent mutiny of elements of the military wing of the RCD-ML, and gave us assurances that he would be treated well. We learned from you also that the RCD-ML called upon its allies of the Ugandan army, the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF) to restore order in Bunia. We understand from other reliable sources that the Rwampara training center is under the command of the UPDF.  We are gravely concerned because last November, in similar circumstances of challenge to the authority of the RCD-ML and its UPDF backers, a detainee held by the RCD-ML security forces died as a result of torture. Four leaders of Civil Society groups arrested in mid-November 1999 in the Congolese town of Butembo, which the RCD-ML controls, were severely tortured. Desire Lumbu Lumbu, a prominent local leader, had lost an eye under torture, and entered into a terminal coma after his release. He died in hospital of brain hemorrhage on December 11, 1999.  Concerned about the information on the treatment reserved by the RCD-ML to the current detainees, we would like to appeal to you, and to the UPDF which is backing your movement, to do all that is in your joint capacity so that detained individuals are not subjected to torture or to ill treatment. They must be held under humane conditions, be placed in official centers of detention, and allowed access to medical care and be given decent food.

The international monitoring organization also said residents of New York city should take a particular interest in the fate of the missing activist, who is a permanent resident of Woodside, Queens. Jafar is also a student at the New School and a sometime taxi driver in the New York metropolitan area. """"Jafar came to New York because he knew he had more freedom to work on Aceh here than he had in Indonesia,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"He could draw on the city's resources to raise alarms about ongoing human rights violations in Aceh, and he chose New York because Queens has the largest community of Acehnese in the United States."""" Aceh, on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, is a province of Indonesia, where a pro-independence movement has been clashing with the Indonesian army for the last twenty-three years.  Jafar Siddiq Hamzah left New York to return to Aceh in late June. On Saturday afternoon, he vanished, following a meeting with an Acehnese businessman in Medan, Indonesia's third largest city. He did not keep a meeting with a Japanese visitor that evening, and he did not return home that night. His family, whom he normally telephoned every few hours as a safety precaution, has not heard from him in three days. Family and friends suspect he has been taken into custody by the Indonesian military or paramilitary groups, but on Tuesday (August 8) the regional military commander denied any knowledge of Jafar's whereabouts. Inquiries from the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, and local journalists and human rights monitors have yielded no result.  Jafar had planned to spend the summer in Aceh setting up a network to document human rights violations and to work for a resolution of the political conflict. He was also hoping to open an office there of the International Forum on Aceh, a non-profit organization he helped found in New York in 1998. He then planned to return to New York to resume his studies at the New School, where he is enrolled for the fall semester in the political science department.  But work on Aceh, whether from Aceh or from the city of Medan, can be dangerous. An armed independence movement called the Free Aceh Movement has been active in Aceh since 1977, but Aceh's history of rebellion against central government authority ?both Indonesian and before that, Dutch colonial ?goes back centuries. The current rebellion is rooted in resentment over the lack of benefits that have accrued to Aceh from development of the resources it produces, including oil and natural gas, and the fact that most of the human rights violations against civilians committed in the name of counterinsurgency have gone unpunished.  The fall of former dictator Soeharto in May 1998 and East Timor's successful breakaway from Indonesia last year gave new life to the independence movement in 1999, but fresh activism was met with fresh repression, and hundreds more civilians were killed. The Free Aceh Movement has also been responsible for human rights violations, but many of those targeted by the military were not guerrillas and had no connection with any armed movement. They were students and professionals who believed that the people of Aceh should have a right to determine their own political future.  Jafar has worked to defend human rights in Aceh since the late 1980s, but his decision to found the International Forum on Aceh, and a related organization, the Support Committee for Human Rights in Aceh grew out of his commitment to the notion that Acehnese should be allowed to freely discuss all political options without fear of imprisonment, torture, or disappearance. He helped bring people of widely disparate views into contact with one another and succeeded in getting Indonesian government officials to sit at the same seminar with representatives of the independence movement.  When he returned to Aceh this summer, he was immediately aware that he was being followed. He did not want to be outdoors late at night and made sure that friends and family knew where he was at all times. Too many people he knew had been kidnapped, tortured, or killed. Many Acehnese believed it was safer to be in Medan, the large city to the south of Aceh, and went there for refuge if they faced threats or intimidation. But even Medan could be dangerous. In January 2000, a fifty-three-year-old parliamentarian from Aceh named Nashiruddin Daud was kidnapped there and later killed.","Asia, United States, Indonesia",""

The verdict, in which an overwhelming majority of the court upheld the lifting of immunity, means that Pinochet should now face trial for human rights violations committed at the start of his seventeen-year dictatorship. Although Chilean law sets a low threshold for the lifting of immunity (simply requiring that there be grounds for suspicion of involvement in crimes), only two such actions have been successful in the last thirty-five years. The verdict therefore has considerable legal and symbolic significance, even if Pinochet's health rules out eventual conviction for his crimes. """"This verdict is a tribute to the tenacity of the Chilean human rights movement, which has pursued the goal of accountability year after year,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"It inspires confidence in Chilean democracy, and indeed helps rebuild trust in its judiciary.

Legal actions in Chile against the former dictator gained momentum after U.K. authorities held him for seventeen months under house arrest in Britain while four states sought his extradition. Although Pinochet was returned to Chile in March 2000 on medical grounds, he found himself in a very different country than the one he had left. After years in which justice was a rarity, during 1999 the Chilean courts opened a spate of prosecutions of former generals and lower officers for human rights violations. In July 2000, in another important decision, they convicted a former secret police agent to life imprisonment for murder.  With the Supreme Court's decision today, more such convictions may be expected. The ruling gives further impetus to the legal doctrine followed by the investigating judge Juan Guzman, that """"disappearances"""" are not covered by Chile's amnesty law. It thus opens the way for additional prosecutions of military personnel responsible for crimes against humanity.  Chile's governmental institutions proved their democratic maturity during Pinochet's prosecution. Notably, of the Supreme Court's twenty members, only three were appointed by Pinochet. President Ricardo Lagos resisted calls from the right and pressure from the military to intervene in the trial, which he insisted was solely a matter for the courts. Moreover, the Council for the Defense of the State, an autonomous body which represents the interests of the Chilean State, made itself a party to the prosecution and actively intervened in the case against Pinochet.  Judge Juan Guzman will now take over the reins of the criminal investigation and is expected to order that Pinochet be subjected to medical tests to assess whether his mental condition allows him to stand trial. """"This issue must be resolved transparently, fairly, and with full rights of appeal on both sides,"""" said Vivanco. """"If that is done and seen to be done no one should object to the outcome, since due process is a fundamental concern of the human rights movement.""""","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

Both were convicted of sodomy. Anwar was sentenced to nine years in prison; Sukma received six years and four lashes with a rattan cane. """"The verdicts are another blow to justice in Malaysia,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"What has happened to Anwar and his supporters highlights the fragility of rights there. If you're out of favor with the political leadership ?no matter how high you might rise in the government ?you have very little protection. This is a real step backwards for Malaysia."""" Anwar was Deputy Prime Minister until shortly before he was arrested in September 1998. He was later charged with sodomy and corruption for allegedly using his office to impede police investigations into the sexual misconduct allegations. In April 1999, he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to six years in prison.  The prosecution of Anwar has been widely viewed inside and outside Malaysia as a case of political revenge against Anwar and his supporters, who had grown increasingly critical of Prime Minister Mahathir in the months prior to Anwar's ouster and arrest. Anwar's prosecution has also been seen as undermining the integrity of the Malaysian judiciary, already widely criticized for its lack of independence. The Malaysian human rights organization SUARAM (Suara Rakyat Malaysia), the International Bar Association, and representatives of the European Parliament and the United States, among other international observers, have questioned the fairness of the Malaysian legal system.  The prosecution of Anwar has been marred by heavy-handed tactics and irregularities, including the following: the use of the notorious """"Internal Security Act"""" to detain Anwar for twenty-four days, initially without access to counsel, and others for even longer periods; the abrupt transfer out of the Criminal Division of Senior Judge K. C. Vohrah just prior to assignment of the Anwar case. Judge Vohrah is known for his independence and was in line to hear the Anwar case; the severe beating of Anwar in custody shortly after his initial arrest;  the recanting by key witnesses of their confessions to committing acts of sodomy with Anwar, and their allegations that the confessions were elicited by police coercion and physical abuse. For example, the prosecution threatened to seek the death penalty against Anwar associate K. S. Nallakaruppan, accused of illegally possessing ammunition along with an expired weapons permit, in an apparent attempt to induce him to testify against Anwar; admission into evidence of a prior confession by co-defendant Sukma Dermawan, which was extracted by interrogators while Sukma was held in detention incommunicado for fifteen days without access to counsel, and which he subsequently retracted; statements by Prime Minister Mahathir that assumed Anwar's guilt; the prosecution of defense attorneys for written and oral statements made in the course of Anwar's defense, including 1) the conviction of attorney Zainur Zakaria for contempt for submitting an affidavit outlining the events surrounding Nallakaruppan's guilty plea and alleging that the prosecution fabricated evidence, and 2) the prosecution of defense attorney Karpal Singh with sedition for statements he made in court; shifting factual allegations in the second trial, including the dates of the alleged crime: the prosecution initially charged that Anwar sodomized his wife's driver in Sukma's apartment in May 1994, but then changed the date to May 1992, citing a typographical error. When the defense proved that the apartment was not built until 1993, the prosecution again changed the date. Since Anwar was first detained, the government has also instituted strict controls on rallies, arrested hundreds of protesters, shut down opposition publications, and banned public rallies in the capital. """"This has been a politically motivated prosecution from day one,"""" said Saunders. """"Anwar's arrest in 1998 started a downward spiral for basic civil and political rights in Malaysia. The verdict shows we have not seen the end of it.""""  Human Rights Watch also called on the Malaysian government to drop sedition charges against Karpal Singh relating to statements ?""""people in high places"""" may have poisoned Anwar ?made by him in court. Under both international standards and Malaysian common law, lawyers cannot be prosecuted for in-court statements made in good faith.","Asia, Malaysia",""

""""Former SLA officers and soldiers who committed torture and other crimes should not have impunity abroad,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"They should be held accountable wherever they go -- and this requires earnest efforts on the part of both Lebanon and the international community.""""  In a letter to German foreign minister Joschka Fischer made public today, Human Rights Watch urged that preliminary investigations be undertaken to determine if any of the Lebanese entering Germany have been implicated in torture or other abuses in the former occupied zone. The letter recommended that such investigations should be wide-ranging, and not rely solely on information provided by the Israeli government or the former soldiers and officers themselves. The participation of Lebanese nongovernmental organizations, lawyers and victims in this process should be encouraged.  In a separate letter to Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, also made public, Human Rights Watch recommended that the government establish an independent commission of inquiry to document rights violations that occurred during the occupation and identify those who ordered and committed such crimes. The findings of the commission should then be made available internationally so that judicial authorities in other countries can search for and investigate the alleged perpetrators.  In its letter to President Lahoud, the organization said that the process that Lebanon uses to identify those suspected of serious rights abuses should be """"above reproach."""" It criticized conduct of ongoing military court trials of some 2,400 former militiamen and others as incompatible with international fair-trial standards. These trials involved prolonged incommunicado detention of defendants, allegations of torture, summary proceedings, and an absence of independent judicial oversight of the court.  """"Information obtained in these quick trials, or during the interrogations that preceded them, should not be used to name names. Summary military justice is no substitute for an impartial inquiry that will be taken seriously by the international community,"""" said Megally. Human Rights Watch added that those convicted in the military court should be afforded the opportunity to seek retrials in independent civilian courts with full due process guarantees.  Human Rights Watch also stressed to Germany that any alleged perpetrator of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law should not be returned to Lebanon unless the Lebanese government pledges publicly that that individual will not face interrogation in incommunicado detention and the risk of torture, trials that do not meet international fair-trial standards or the death penalty. In its letter to President Lahoud, the organization made the same recommendation.  A copy of the letter to Foreign Minster Fischer follows.  ***  2 August 2000  Mr. Joschka Fischer Minister of Foreign Affairs Werderscher Markt 1 10117 Berlin  Dear Mr. Fischer,  Human Rights Watch is writing to urge your government to undertake preliminary investigations to determine if former members of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) who are admitted to Germany for asylum and resettlement committed serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law against Lebanese citizens during the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. At the same time, we must emphasize that this process should in no way undermine Germany's legal obligation not to return anyone to a country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened or there is the danger of being subjected to torture.  It was disclosed in the Israeli press on July 20 that the relocation to Germany of some 400 Lebanese who are currently in Israel would occur shortly. On July 31, the press agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported that the first group of former SLA militiamen and their families arrived in Germany that day for resettlement in Hamburg.  We recognize that many of the Lebanese who fled to Israel in May 2000 in the wake of the Israeli military withdrawal may have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their service in the SLA or other relationships with the Israeli occupation apparatus. The prevailing public mood in Lebanon, and particularly in south Lebanon, certainly remains hostile to such individuals. The government has opted for prosecutions in the military court and done little to promote post-occupation reconciliation and tolerance. The potential for physical violence or other forms of persecution of former SLA militiamen and others -- who continue to be widely described in Lebanon as """"collaborators"""" -- has also been tacitly recognized by the military court, which is in the process of rapidly trying several thousand individuals for membership in the SLA and other offenses. The court has already sentenced hundreds of defendants to prison terms that are accompanied by an additional sanction which bans them from returning to their home communities for periods ranging from one to fifteen years after their release. The banning orders began to be issued after two men released by the court in June were violently attacked when they returned to their villages in the former occupied zone.  Human Rights Watch is concerned, however, that among the Lebanese arriving in Germany may be former SLA militiamen who tortured detainees at Khiam prison and other locations in the Israeli-occupied zone, engaged in hostage-taking of civilians, expelled individuals and entire families from their homes and villages, and forcibly conscripted men and boys into service in the SLA, which functioned as Israel's surrogate militia. These crimes were systematically practiced against the civilian populuation in the occupied zone as a matter of policy over two decades, and have been documented by international and Lebanese nongovernmental organizations. Lebanese who ordered or committed such crimes should not enjoy impunity in Germany. The legal burden is on German immigration and judicial authorities to see that such individuals are held accountable for their actions and brought to justice. Under international law, every person has the right to seek political asylum as a refugee, with the exception of individuals who are known or suspected to have committed war crimes and other grave offenses. Article 1(F) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, to which Germany is a state party, specifically states that its protections """"shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that (a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes"""".  Accordingly, German authorities should carefully scrutinize the background of each former SLA militiaman entering its territory, with the aim of establishing with accuracy the person's identity, responsibilities, and activities during the Israeli occupation, beyond the data that may have been supplied by Israeli government sources and the militiamen themselves. The cooperation and assistance of knowledgeable and credible sources should be sought, both inside and outside of Lebanon, in order to obtain and confirm relevant information, and ascertain if any evidence exists linking specific individuals to war crimes. As part of this process, a mechanism could be established to encourage and enable other interested parties -- including Lebanese victims, lawyers, and nongovernmental organizations -- to provide documentation about specific individuals who have been implicated in torture and other abuses in the former occupied zone and are known to have left Lebanon.  Germany also has obligations under the refugee convention, the Convention against Torture, and the European Convention on Human Rights not to return individuals to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened or where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture. With regard to Lebanon, no one should be returned there for prosecution if he will face interrogation in incommunicado detention and the risk of torture; trials that do not meet international fair trial standards; or the death penalty. Human Rights Watch has recommended to the Lebanese government that it establish an independent commission of inquiry to investigate violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that occurred during the occupation of south Lebanon and make available its findings to the international community. We have stated clearly to the government that any perpetrators that the commission identifies should be tried fairly in civilian courts with all due process guarantees. Requests for the extradition of perpetrators living abroad should not be granted unless the Lebanese government can provide such assurances.  Germany's offer to provide refuge to Lebanese and their families who are unwilling to return home for fear of persecution is a commendable humanitarian response. In keeping with its international legal responsibilities, however, Germany should publicly pledge that it will undertake vigorous efforts to identify and bring to justice those Lebanese who have committed grave human rights offenses under international law, while ensuring that persons will be not be returned to Lebanon if they could face torture or threats to their life or freedom there.

Security Council to address the grave humanitarian consequences of the sanctions it imposed on Iraq ten years ago this Sunday.  """"The steps the Council has taken to date do not come to grips with the fundamental problem,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Sanctions intended to block the government's access to foreign exchange have contributed to pervasive life-threatening public health conditions for millions of innocent people. An emergency commodity assistance program like oil-for-food, no matter how well funded or well run, cannot reverse the devastating consequences of war and then ten years of virtual shut-down of Iraq's economy.""""  The letter noted that U.N. bodies including the Security Council have called for targeted sanctions in the future that minimize impact on civilians, and called on the Council """"to apply these recommendations without further delay to the case of Iraq.""""  """"The Iraqi government bears a large share of the blame for the crisis,"""" said Megally, """"but in seeking to compel Iraq's compliance on disarmament matters the Council should devise means which directly impact those in power, not the ordinary citizens who already suffer under their repression.""""  The other groups signing the letter include Save the Children (UK), the Mennonite Central Committee, the Quaker United Nations Office, Global Policy Forum, and the Peace Action Education Fund. This coalition wrote to the Security Council prior to its March 24, 2000 debate on Iraq policy, urging the Council to give priority to humanitarian and human rights principles in the design and operation of the sanctions regime.  In early January Human Rights Watch sent a lengthy letter and memo urging the Security Council to lift most restrictions on non-military trade and investment while tightening controls on Iraq's ability to import weapons-related goods. Human Rights Watch, citing its own documentation of Iraqi government responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, also called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to hold accountable those responsible.  A copy of the letter sent today is attached.  Open Letter to the Security Council Concerning the Humanitarian Situation in Iraq  Global Policy Forum Human Rights Watch Mennonite Central Committee United Nations Office Peace Action Education Fund Quaker United Nations Office Save the Children UK  To: His Excellency Hasmy Agam Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for Malaysia President of the United Nations Security Council Cc: Security Council Member State Delegations  August 4, 2000  Dear Mr President and other Member State representatives:  The approach of the tenth anniversary of the imposition of comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq prompts us to share with you the following urgent thoughts. In March our six organisations wrote to the Security Council to urge it to address the humanitarian emergency in Iraq in a thorough and transparent manner. We affirm the positive steps that have been taken so far but remain convinced that additional far reaching steps are desperately needed in order to comply with human rights and humanitarian principles.  We welcome the Council's mandate to the Secretariat to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the humanitarian situation in Resolution 1302. We are hopeful that the Secretariat will, in fact, be able to complete this assessment by November 26 of this year.  We are glad to note the Council's approval of accelerated procedures for contract approval in five sectors. At the same time we draw attention to the fact that """"holds"""" by Council members on pending contracts are still a serious problem. We note that more than a quarter of the holds, in dollar value, are in the electricity sector, which is critical to the repair of the country's public health infrastructure.  We regret that no progress seems to have been made in the discussions underway to build a """"cash component"""" into the humanitarian program in the government-controlled areas. We urge speedy agreement on and implementation of local procurement and disbursement of cash revenues for recurrent expenses. The 30 March 1999 report of the Council's own """"humanitarian panel,"""" as well as reports of U.N. organisations in the field such as UNICEF, have stressed the vital need for such a component, and Resolution 1284 (1999) approves its use.  The deterioration in Iraq's civilian infrastructure is so far reaching that it can only be reversed with extensive investment and development efforts. When comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq were extended under Resolution 687 (1991), the expectation of the Security Council and other parties was that sanctions would be in place for a relatively short time. Whatever the extent of Iraqi non-compliance with the provisions of that resolution, the Council must recognise that the sanctions have contributed in a major way to persistent life-threatening conditions in the country, and that short-term emergency assistance is no longer appropriate to the scale of this humanitarian crisis.  A number of United Nations bodies, including the Security Council and General Assembly, have acknowledged the critical need to devise sanctions that are targeted, effective, and credible. Most recently, the 19 July report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council and the General Assembly on children and armed conflict (A/55/163-S/2000/712, section F) stressed the need to protect children from the impact of sanctions. Referring to the """"immediate and long-term costs [of sanctions] to children, including the collapse of health and education infrastructures, reduced economic opportunities, increased child labor in informal sectors and increased infant morbidity and mortality"""", the report went on to note in particular """"the suffering of Iraqi children.""""  It is essential to apply these insights, conclusions, and recommendations without further delay to the case of Iraq, where the continued imposition of comprehensive economic sanctions is undermining the basic rights of children and the civilian population generally. We call upon Security Council member states in the strongest terms to take the further steps that are necessary to protect and advance these fundamental rights of civilians and to address forthrightly the unacceptable discrepancy between the emerging general principles of sanctions policy and the application of sanctions in the case of Iraq.  Mindful of the enormous responsibilities which stand before you, we are,  Yours sincerely, /S/ James Paul Executive Director Global Policy Forum  /S/ Hanny Megally Executive Director Middle East and North Africa Division Human Rights Watch  /S/ John Rempel Liaison to the United Nations Mennonite Central Committee  /S/ Tracy Moavero International Office Co-ordinator Peace Action Education Fund  /S/ David Jackman Quaker United Nations Representative Quaker United Nations Office  /S/ Carolyn Miller Head of Programmes Save the Children UK","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","United Nations"

""""This latest move to quash criticism testifies to the degraded state of civil liberties in Tunisia today,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"In his speech last Friday, President Ben Ali confirmed his government's intolerance of Tunisians who seek to exercise their most basic civil rights -- while at the same time proclaiming his dedication to democratic principles.""""  In early June, after the return of his passport, Dr. Marzouki requested a two-week leave of absence from the university. This was refused, even though, according to Dr. Marzouki, the term was finished, exams had been graded, and he had several months of unused leave. He then secured a medical recommendation that he take time off for health reasons. He left for France in early June and returned to Tunisia on July 5.  On July 27, Dr. Marzouki was summoned to appear before the disciplinary council of the ministry of health to answer charges that the medical recommendation was fraudulent and that he had thus violated administrative procedures by traveling without permission. His lawyer attended in his place, but his request for a postponement of the hearing was refused. On July 28, President Ben Ali, speaking to cadres of his ruling RCD party, threatened to prosecute unnamed citizens whose criticisms of Tunisia while abroad """"amount[ed] to treason."""" On July 29, Dr. Marzouki received a hand-delivered one-sentence notice from the Ministry of Health stating """"This is to inform you that, on the basis of your referral to the disciplinary committee on 27 July 2000, you have been permanently dismissed from your job.""""  In a statement faxed to news agencies on July 31, the Ministry of Health stated that """"[a]n official inquiry has yielded the evidence that Dr. Marzouki has attempted to mislead the authorities by submitting a bogus medical certificate to justify his illicit absence.""""  """"The authorities returned Marzouki's passport in response to international pressure,"""" said Megally, """"but they were determined that he would pay an unacceptably high price if he tried to use it. The penalty of permanent dismissal is completely disproportionate and shows the extent to which the government uses Tunisian universities to enforce its repressive policies.""""  Dr. Marzouki told Human Rights Watch that he intends to appeal his dismissal.  Dr. Marzouki, a former president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights (LTDH), is presently the spokesperson for the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT). In reprisal for his human rights activism, the government closed down the Center for Community Medicine, which he had founded, in 1993, and subsequently prohibited him from carrying out medical research. He was jailed for four months in 1994 after he declared himself an opposition candidate to President Ben Ali in that year's presidential elections. Following threats to himself and his family, his wife and two daughters moved to Europe. In June 1999, Dr. Marzouki was abducted by plainclothes security officials and held incommunicado for several days. Until the beginning of June, he had been without a passport and unable to travel abroad for professional purposes or to visit his family. His home telephone and fax lines were regularly cut.  In response to the Tunisian government's efforts to suppress the Tunisian League for Human Rights and other independent civic organizations, in December 1998 Dr. Marzouki and other veteran human rights activists announced the formation of the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia. The Ministry of the Interior has refused to grant the CNLT legal status as a nongovernmental organization, but the organization has nevertheless continued to issue critical bulletins and reports documenting government repression and denial of fundamental civil liberties. He and other prominent CNLT members have faced repeated judicial inquiries on spurious charges of """"defaming the public order"""" and """"spreading false information.""""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/02/egypt-harassment-academics","Egypt- Harassment of Academics","Egypt: Harassment of Academics","","08/02/2000","In a letter released today, Human Rights Watch's Academic Freedom Committee condemned Egypt's ongoing closure of a leading democratization think tank. """"Egypt should immediately reopen the Center,"""" said Hanny Megally, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division. """"This type of harassment is intended to deter other academics from pursuing research and will hurt the free exchange of ideas crucial to a healthy society in advance of an important electoral period.""""  Although authorities have failed to specify any exact charges against them, several researchers from the Center have remained in custody for over a month. The Academic Freedom Committee urged Egypt's Prime Minister, Dr. Atef Ebeid, """"to state its commitment to protecting and promoting academic freedom in Egypt by either immediately reopening the Ibn Khaldun Center and releasing its staff and associates, or by promptly affording them the opportunity to defend themselves against formal charges in a court of law.""""  The Committee expressed its concern that the Center's closure indicates increasingly strict limits on academic freedom in Egypt in anticipation of the upcoming parliamentary elections. Further, the researchers' detention comes on the heels of another recent incident in which the Egyptian government imposed administrative sanctions on thirty-six school teachers who attended workshops on civil education.  The full text of the Academic Freedom Committee's letter to Dr. Ebeid is below.  Prime Minister Dr. Atef Mohamed Ebeid Office of the Prime Minister Maglis al-Sha'ab Street Cairo, Egypt  Your Excellency,  We write this open letter on behalf of the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch to protest the ongoing detention of Prof. Saad El-Din Ibrahim and other staff members and researchers of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies (""""the Center""""), and to urge their immediate release and the reopening of the Center.  Although the authorities have failed to specify the exact charges against them, Prof. Ibrahim and several of his colleagues have remained in custody for nearly a month. Indeed, the State Security Prosecution recently extended their detention for another fifteen-day period. We are particularly alarmed by reports that Ms. Nadia Abd al-Nour, the Center's financial director, was subjected to an intimidating interrogation session during which she was removed from her cell at the women's section of al-Qanater prison and transferred late at night to the men's cell block where security forces questioned her in violation of proper judicial process. The Center itself remains closed and its files and computers have been confiscated by security personnel. We believe that the Center's continued closure and the violations of due process for its staff will severely harm the environment for independent research and academic freedom in Egypt.  The persecution of Dr. Ibrahim and his colleagues seems to stem from the Center's role as a monitor of the upcoming parliamentary elections. The Center is internationally renowned for the study of applied social sciences in Egypt and the Arab world and publishes Civil Society, a monthly newsletter that is an important source of information and analysis for scholars. Dr. Ibrahim is widely known for his work on democratization as the chair of the Sociology Department at the American University in Cairo and as a former Secretary General of the Arab Organization for Human Rights and the Arab Thought Forum. At least three other detainees also seem to have been targeted for their research activity: Mr. Khaled Fayyad, the Center's coordinator for political education and electoral rights, and Mr. Ayman Jabal and Mr. Usama Hammed, researchers. None have been formally charged with any crimes.  Given the lack of any formal charges against the staff and associates of the Center, their prolonged detention appears to be an attempt to deter the Center from its academic mission of studying democratic reform and the strengthening of civil society. Our concern for the Center's closure is heightened because it follows a marked worsening of the situation of educators and academics in Egypt. We earlier stated our concerns in this regard to you in our letter of May 9 about the imposition of administrative sanctions on several teachers who had participated in training sessions on civic education and democratization. As we stated in that letter, there can be no meaningful citizenship and democracy without the ability of individuals to seek and impart information and ideas about their own society. Independent academic activity, such as that undertaken by the Ibn Khaldun Center, is crucial for fostering this ability.  When Egypt acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on January 14, 1982, it made a commitment to guarantee all individuals the """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds."""" The closure of the Center and the ongoing detention of its staff violate this fundamental right. Furthermore, the ongoing imprisonment of Prof. Ibrahim, Ms. Abd al-Nour, Mr. Fayyad, Mr. Jabal, Mr. Hammed and the other staff and associates of the Ibn Khaldun Center violates their right to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention. Their harassment will likely deter other academics from freely pursuing their research for fear of suffering the same treatment.  A vibrant civil society and the free exchange of views and ideas are essential for any healthy society and especially for a country preparing to enter an important electoral period. Therefore we respectfully urge your government to state its commitment to protecting and promoting academic freedom in Egypt by either immediately reopening the Ibn Khaldun Center and releasing its staff and associates, or by promptly affording them the opportunity to defend themselves against formal charges in a court of law.

Nearly 10 years after the breakup of the Soviet empire, most citizens of former East Bloc countries enjoy the freedoms inscribed in the Helsinki Final Act. The most glaring exception: the residents of the five Central Asian republics--""""the Stans""""--which suffer under authoritarian regimes that are arguably worse than the old Soviet Union. The United States should be doing much more to counteract the worsening authoritarian trend. These are states without politics, where former communist leaders have clung to power by silencing, jailing or exiling the political opposition groups that flowered in the early 1990s. Elections in each have grown steadily more farcical over the course of the decade: Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov's state-sponsored rival in the January presidential ballot admitted casting his own vote for the incumbent, """"in order to save democracy."""" Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akaev is disqualifying his potential opponents in the vote this October by orchestrating trumped-up criminal charges against them--a tactic that President Nursultan Nazarbaev of Kazakhstan has also used repeatedly. And President Saparmurad Niazov of Turkmenistan, who calls himself Turkmenbashi--""""head of the Turkmen""""--has dispensed with the need for presidential elections entirely by having himself declared president for life. The state of civil rights in Central Asia is little better. Police in all five countries extract bribes and confessions through systematic torture, while in Tajikistan, armed criminal gangs linked to the government terrorize the population unchecked. Free expression is unheard of, and each state has thwarted the growth of civil society to varying degrees. Religious freedom, too, continues to suffer: Most of the countries have enacted laws on religion more stringent than that of the old Soviet Union. In Turkmenistan, faiths other than Russian Orthodoxy and mainstream Sunni Islam are criminalized. And in Uzbekistan, thousands of observant Muslims who avoid the state-controlled mosques have been sentenced to long prison terms for """"anti-state activity."""" Limited market """"reforms"""" in each country have amounted to little more than the license for those in power to loot state assets, as the recent U.S. Justice Department investigation of accounts linked to President Nazarbaev of Kazakhstan makes clear. The International Monetary Fund recently stated that $600 million to $800 million annually is spirited out of Uzbekistan, a country with supposedly strict foreign exchange controls. Twenty-five years after Helsinki, human rights activists in Central Asia encounter repression as harsh as any Czech or Polish dissident ever faced. But while the West lionized anti-communist agitators, it pays little attention to the Central Asian men and women who are exiled, jailed and tortured. The United States has cozied up to Central Asia's authoritarian rulers, eager to secure access to oil and gas, and to outmaneuver Russia as the regional heavyweight. Washington may issue perfunctory criticism of the Central Asian states' human rights records, but the money keeps flowing nonetheless. The Clinton administration has been unwilling to stand by its obligations under U.S. law to restrict assistance to some of these countries as gross violators of human rights. This has involved some shameful whitewashing. To maintain the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the administration certified Uzbekistan as """"committed to human rights""""--even though the Uzbek government imprisons people for up to 20 years for distributing Islamic leaflets. These repressive policies, supposedly designed to undermine the politicization of Islam, have in fact contributed to it. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is the heir to the Helsinki process. After the Cold War, the OSCE was expressly mandated to help guide the states of Central Asia through a democratic transition. In fact, the OSCE has resisted throwing its weight behind criticisms of serious violations of human rights. It is not living up to the spirit of Helsinki. U.S. policy since the end of the Cold War has focused obsessively on safeguarding the """"independence"""" of the Central Asian states from Moscow. But let's remember why that independence from the Soviet Union was so ardently sought. Moscow ruled the republics with an iron hand and denied people basic human rights. Now the people of Central Asia have merely traded one iron hand for another. They've got nothing to celebrate on this 25th anniversary.

The answer lies with the United Nations Security Council, which is meeting this week to consider how to set up a war crimes tribunal for this ravaged African country.   Having tried and failed to buy peace on the cheap, the council now faces a defining moment. How it responds will speak volumes about its capacity to meet the difficult challenge of abusive civil wars, particularly in Africa.   The last time that the U.N. had a chance to wrest Sierra Leone from its nightmare, it failed miserably. In January 1999, Freetown, the capital, was under siege by a barbarous group of thugs known as the Revolutionary United Front. The RUF lived off the country's rich diamond fields and terrorized the population with its signature atrocity of chopping off arms and hands of men, women and often children.   The government clung to power with the help of a Nigerian-led West African force known as Ecomog. But Nigeria threatened to withdraw its troops, in part because the U.N., the U.S., and other Western nations refused to help cover its expenses, which were said to come to $1 million a day. (By the time the U.S. did offer funds, the Nigerians were battle-weary and nearly broke. Many Nigerian soldiers were only fed because ordinary Sierra Leone citizens took them into their homes.)   With the Nigerians threatening to exit, the U.S. had to act. Desperate to avoid having to deploy his own troops, U.S. President Bill Clinton sent an envoy -- Jesse Jackson. Backed by Britain and a group of West African states, Mr. Jackson brokered a surrender to the RUF in the guise of a """"peace accord.""""   This July 1999 accord, signed in the Togolese capital of Lome, granted amnesty to the RUF for all of its atrocities, named its leader, Foday Sankoh, Sierra Leone's vice president, and awarded him the ministry that controls the diamond fields. When this settlement was greeted by protests of revulsion, the U.N., at the last minute, inserted a provision denying international, as opposed to national, recognition of the amnesty. But this fig leaf failed to stimulate any action to prosecute the RUF for its many crimes against humanity. The lesson was clear: the RUF would pay no price -- indeed, would be rewarded -- for its ruthlessness.   Embarrassing Capture It took the RUF little time to learn this lesson. Its attacks continued, and no one did anything to stop them. Then, in May 2000, as U.N. peacekeepers drawn exclusively from developing countries replaced Nigeria's forces, the RUF took several hundred U.N. troops hostage. The badly equipped, poorly led U.N. force put up little resistance. Its embarrassing capture raised troubling questions about the U.N.'s capacity and willingness to secure peace amidst Africa's civil wars.   Crack British paratroopers came to the rescue and re-established a sort of equilibrium. The capital was secured. The U.N. hostages were freed. But it was a false dawn. Most of the British forces have now withdrawn, and violence against civilians has stepped up again.   The question remains: will the U.N. do any better this time? That depends on whether the U.N. Security Council is willing to make the necessary commitment of troops and funds.   There is broad consensus in the Security Council that the response must include a stronger military presence and a reinforced arms and diamonds embargo. This should mean that U.N. troops are given the arms, equipment, and mandate to protect civilians, starting in Freetown and extending as quickly as possible to the rest of the country. Much as Western leaders do not want to hear it, that will probably require troops from the industrialized world -- and not only from Britain.   The existing arms embargo must also be monitored and rigorously enforced -- again with qualified troops patrolling borders and airfields. A newly imposed embargo on sales of diamonds from rebel-held territory must also be strictly enforced by troops and other means. These steps will help stop the deadly diamonds-for-arms trade, mostly through neighboring Liberia, that fuels the rebel rampage.   The Security Council seems also finally to agree in principle on the need to bring to justice those who have been responsible for the worst human rights abuses in Sierra Leone. The mechanism is likely to be a special court combining Sierra Leonean and international jurists. Still, major differences remain about the exact powers of the court -- the scope of its jurisdiction, the extent of international participation, and the degree of respect to give the """"Lome amnesty."""" The resolution of these issues will dramatically affect the court's ability to establish the rule of law and deter further atrocities.   The first dispute is over whom the court will prosecute. Certainly the worst offenders have been Mr. Sankoh and his brutal RUF. But other militia in the country have also committed atrocities against civilians and must be brought to justice. These include former members of the Sierra Leone Army, a group known as the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and the civilian defense forces militia, the most powerful of which is the Kamajors. But these groups are currently allied with the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and provide an important part of its defense. The Security Council, hoping to subcontract Sierra Leone's defense at least in part to these murderous allies, has been reluctant to pursue their crimes. That is dangerously short-sighted and wrong.   To begin with, an internationally sponsored court will have little credibility if its prosecutions are limited to current government enemies. That would compromise the basic principle that justice should be applied to everyone within a court's jurisdiction. Instead, the Security Council should insist on a court that is empowered to prosecute anyone in Sierra Leone who directs or oversees specified offenses, such as war crimes or crimes against humanity, regardless of their current political allegiance.   Moreover, quite apart from its legitimacy, such a broadly empowered court would advance peace by helping to deter atrocities by all militia, even current government allies. Sierra Leone has too long a history of shifting alliances and murderous double-crosses to trust that the RUF comprises the sole threat to the security of the Sierra Leonean people. Johnny Koroma, the head of the AFRC militia, led a May 1997 coup against President Kabbah's elected government, while the AFRC and others committed appalling abuses in the January 1999 offensive against Freetown in which thousands lost their lives. Only a court that is capable of prosecuting the worst human rights offenders regardless of their current loyalties can prevent the murderous back-stabbing and about-faces that make up so much of Sierra Leone's recent and sad history.   Second, despite the commendable desire to help build the Sierra Leonean justice system, the U.N.-sponsored court should contain a majority of international jurists. It is understandable that the international community wants to create a tribunal that builds on, and thus helps to strengthen, the Sierra Leonean justice system. Such a hybrid system may leave a more workable legacy within the country, and the informality of a mixed tribunal may allow it to be created more quickly than a purely U.N.-run, bureaucracy-laden institution.   Largely Decimated But the fact remains that the Sierra Leonean justice system has been largely decimated. A primary international role is essential to resist predictably intense pressure on government-appointed judges and prosecutors to overlook atrocities by militia that are currently allied with the government. Indeed, a court that is seen as subject to influence by the Sierra Leonean government would create a perverse new incentive to continue fighting for power, as a means of securing the prosecutorial levers that might guarantee impunity from prosecution.   Finally, the court must be empowered to ignore the Lome amnesty, which purported to pardon atrocities committed before July 1999, when many of the worst human rights crimes were committed. The amnesty was an affront to international law and the Sierra Leonean people that never should have been granted in the first place. Moreover, to force a prosecutor to ignore these earlier crimes would compel him to fight for justice with one hand tied behind his back -- particularly in Sierra Leone, where collecting evidence is so dangerous.   The Security Council has been reluctant to abandon the Lome amnesty because of hope that life might still be breathed into the Lome peace accord -- that peace might still be bought on the cheap. But that pipe dream is no reason to perpetuate the dangerous lesson of Lome that the U.N. would rather ignore the atrocities of the past than make the commitment of troops and resources to secure peace. Half-hearted shortcuts will no longer do.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations, Peace and Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/08/01/deteriorating-conditions-burmese-refugees-malaysia","Deteriorating Conditions for Burmese Refugees in Malaysia","Deteriorating Conditions for Burmese Refugees in Malaysia","","08/01/2000","Malaysia's treatment of thousands of Burmese refugees is bad and getting worse, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today. After fleeing systematic discrimination, forced labor, and other abuses in Burma, ethnic Rohingya in Malaysia face a whole new set of abuses in Malaysia. These include beatings, extortion, and arbitrary detention. The refugees are forced to live in poverty and constant fear of expulsion from the country.  """"Malaysia is treating the Rohingya in a shameful manner,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The country has treated refugees better in the past. It owes them better treatment in the future.""""  The 78-page report, """"Living in Limbo: Burmese Rohingyas in Malaysia,"""" details the treatment of Rohingya exiles in Malaysia. Denied legal recognition as refugees, Rohingya children are often not permitted to attend school, and many are denied health care. They are also at constant risk of arrest. Malaysian government officials detain and deport even those persons the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has recognized as refugees.  In Malaysia's immigration detention camps, out of the eye of domestic and international monitors, detainees have been robbed and beaten. Former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch claimed that food and medical care is grossly inadequate in some detention centers, and that some detainees had died as a result. Children have been detained with unrelated adults, separated from their families, and deported alone to the Thai border. From the moment of their arrest to their expulsion, the Rohingya are vulnerable to demands for bribes by government officials.  Malaysia's treatment of the Rohingya is part of a larger failure to protect refugees, no matter where they come from. Malaysia has no asylum system, and treats refugees as illegal immigrants. In the report, Human Rights Watch calls on donor nations and friends of Malaysia to press the government to recognize the rights of refugees, to stop all deportions of individuals who face persecution in their home countries, and to bring its practices into line with minimum standards governing treatment of refugees.  The Rohingyas, most of whom come from Arakan state in western Burma and have family roots there going back generations, are often denied full citizenship rights by the Burmese government. Unlike the bulk of Burma's population, the Rohingya are Muslim rather than Buddhist. Denial of citizenship means Rohingya are not free to travel outside or within the country, are refused government jobs, and have restricted educational opportunities. They also are more likely than other groups to be subjected to abuse such as forced labor and arbitrary confiscation of property. In the new report, Human Rights Watch calls on the Burmese government to repeal discriminatory laws, to reform its citizenship laws, and to recognize the Rohingya as full citizens.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has an office in Malaysia and has been able to secure protection for some Rohingya by registering them or granting them refugee status. UNHCR's efforts to date, however, have also fallen short. Out of nearly 1,600 applications by Rohingya for refugee status in 1999, only forty-three were granted, suggesting that UNHCR is systematically underestimating the dangers Rohingya face if forced back to Burma. UNHCR also has been unable to stem the abuses suffered by Rohingya in detention and, in many cases, their forced expulsion across the border.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), Malaysia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/07/30/lebanon-letter-president-emile-lahoud","Lebanon- Letter to President Emile Lahoud","Lebanon: Letter to President Emile Lahoud","","07/30/2000","Human Rights Watch is writing with recommendations about the administration of justice for individuals implicated under Lebanese and international law for various acts during the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.  The Military Court Trials The trials that began in the military court on June 5 do not appear to be aimed at identifying and prosecuting Lebanese who committed the most serious offenses under international human rights and humanitarian law. Rather, the rapid pace at which the tribunal has been conducting the trials leaves little doubt that the goal is to prosecute and punish as quickly as possible, in summary proceedings, those who were taken into custody after the Israeli withdrawal. This diverse group includes former SLA combatants of various ranks, civilians who traveled to or worked in Israel or for the Israeli civil administration in south Lebanon, and individuals who provided information to Israeli intelligence operatives.  The court has been convening in lengthy sessions that typically commence at ten in the morning and end at about nine in the evening. The judges only have time to deliberate on cases between the daily recess in the afternoon, and after the trials conclude in the evening, with judgments handed down before or after midnight. The number of defendants has varied at each session. On June 23, for example, the court tried eighty-three defendants, whose sentences ranged from one week to five years imprisonment, in addition to banning many of them from returning to their communities for periods ranging from one year to seven years after release from prison. Nineteen were tried on July 9, while on July 14 the number increased to seventy.  A Human Rights Watch representative who attended five sessions of the military court in June observed that the time allotted to each defendant's trial ranged from a minimum of two minutes to a maximum of fifteen minutes, with the length determined by the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the charges. The presiding judge asked most defendants similar questions and would refer to information in their files that had been collected by military intelligence investigators while defendants were held incommunicado and had no access to lawyers. Civilians who visited Israel were asked when and why they traveled there, and, if relevant, were questioned further about the type of jobs they held and the dates of employment. Former employees of the civil administration were asked to describe their jobs, salary, length of service, and supervisors, and were also queried about their contacts with Israeli officers and information that they provided about individuals or suspicious movements to SLA or Israeli officers. Former militiamen were questioned about circumstances of their recruitment, dates of service, and salary, and were asked to describe where they served, the weapons they carried, and military operations in which they participated. They were also asked to provide the names of their immediate commanders and the soldiers who served with them, and describe information that they provided to SLA or Israeli officers about individuals or suspicious movements.  We observed that defense lawyers were not familiar with the case files, which they received the day before the proceedings. Some lawyers told us that the files did not necessarily include the complete record of their clients' interrogations and may have been abbreviated summaries. Although the court was willing to grant lawyers' requests for an adjournment of several weeks in order to study the files and prepare a proper legal defense, in most cases the lawyers did not ask for more time. They appeared resigned to the fact that the court was issuing formulaic judgments and sentences in the overwhelming majority of cases, and that more personalized defenses would have no effect on the court's rulings.  Following the questions of the presiding judge, there was rarely cross-examination of defendants by the military prosecutors or the defense lawyers. We also noted that lawyers typically opted for broad, standardized defenses rather than tailoring statements to the individual facts and evidence of the cases of their clients.  The abbreviated proceedings and speed that have been the main features of these trials since June 5 -- which have gone largely unchallenged by defense lawyers -- leaves the defendants without the rights ensured under article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Lebanon has ratified. These include the right """"to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing"""" (article 14/3/b) and the right """"to examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him"""" (article 14/3/e).  The military court has ignored the claims of some defendants that they were tortured or mistreated while in custody. According to the Foundation for Human and Humanitarian Rights in Lebanon (FHHRL), a nongovernmental organization that is monitoring the trials, these include: Hussein Zayn al-Abidin (June 21 trial); Zakaria Fadlallah Jum'a (June 26 trial); and Hanna Karim al-Alam (July 3 trial). FHHRL reported that al-Alam """"claimed that he was tortured and pointed out to the court the pus and blood-stained bandages around his leg,"""" and said that medical care was not provided for five days.  A last concern is that there is no independent judicial oversight of the military court. The U.N. Human Rights Committee noted this in April 1997, when it expressed concern about """"the lack of supervision over the military court's procedures and verdicts by the ordinary courts.""""  Given these major shortcomings, Human Rights Watch recommends that those convicted in the military court be afforded the opportunity to seek a retrial before an independent and impartial civilian court with full due process guarantees, including effective legal representation and court procedures that allow time for the presentation of evidence and witnesses. Anyone convicted in a retrial also must be afforded the right to have the judgment and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal in accordance with Lebanese law.  Formation of a Commission of Inquiry The structure and scope of the ongoing trials in the military court do not provide a venue for eyewitnesses to or victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law to be heard. Human Rights Watch therefore urges the government to conduct thorough, independent and transparent investigations in order to identify Lebanese and Israelis suspected of committing such crimes during the occupation of south Lebanon. Particularly with respect to the gravity of alleged offenses that may constitute war crimes, the process used to identify suspects must be above reproach. For this reason we recommend that the government assign this responsibility to an independent commission of inquiry, especially in light of the substantial flaws noted above with respect to the military justice system.  Since the Israeli withdrawal, investigators from Lebanese military intelligence and investigating judges from the military court have questioned former SLA militiamen in advance of their trials. This process undoubtedly has yielded information about the command and control structure of the militia, and its direct and indirect links to Israeli military and intelligences forces. The files may also include testimony about Lebanese and Israeli perpetrators of crimes such as torture at Khiam detention center and local SLA security offices, expulsion of individuals and entire families from the zone, and forced conscription of men and children into the militia.  This information is likely to be tainted, however, because it was obtained while the detainees were held incommunicado and some of them reportedly were subjected to physical abuse. The complete interrogation and investigation files should nevertheless be provided to the commission of inquiry for the purpose of identifying eyewitnesses and others who may have knowledge of specific acts that violate international law. The commission should hear the testimony again under conditions that are not coercive and conform to international standards of witness deposition. From this starting point, evidence can be sought in a systematic manner.  The inquiry should not be restricted to information provided by former militiamen and others who have been or will be tried in the military court. It should extend to individual victims who can describe specific incidents or identify Lebanese and Israeli perpetrators. Research that Human Rights Watch has undertaken in south Lebanon indicates that residents there are able and willing to provide detailed and persuasive testimony about the perpetrators and circumstances of torture, forced conscription, and expulsion. Last month, residents of one village provided information about six former SLA militiamen who tortured or ordered the torture of civilians in their custody.  Suspects in Lebanon who are identified in the investigations of the commission of inquiry should not face the military judicial system but should be tried in civilian courts with all due process guarantees.  Suspects in Israel and Other Countries Some suspects may include former SLA officers who were not active in the militia at the time of the withdrawal but left Lebanon and secured legal residence abroad in past years. Others may be among the thousands who fled Lebanon for Israel during the Israeli military withdrawal in May. It is widely expected that most of those who fled will be settled in Israel or leave for third countries. The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported on June 2 that about 1,000 will leave Israel """"in coming months to be given political asylum abroad"""" and that """"countries in Europe and in North and South America have agreed to accept former [SLA] men and their families on humanitarian grounds."""" The newspaper also reported that """"Israel will finance resettling the refugees abroad,"""" and said that the effort is being coordinated by the Defense Directorate for Aid, a division of the Shin Bet, one of the Israeli intelligence agencies that was active in former occupied zone. According to a report in the Jerusalem Post on July 17, among the countries that may consider asylum for former militiamen are Canada, Chile, France, Germany, and the United States.  Under international law, every person has the right to seek asylum. The only exception involves persons who are known or suspected to have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. It is the responsibility of the Lebanese government to ensure that the international community is informed of the individuals known or suspected to have committed war crimes during the occupation of southern Lebanon.  Thorough, independent, and transparent investigations by the commission of inquiry would enable judicial authorities in the countries where former miliamen are currently living, or where they are seeking political asylum, to identify and search for such persons. If the Lebanese government wishes to request the return of these individuals to Lebanon for prosecution, it should publicly pledge that they will not be held in incommunicado detention and at risk of torture, that they will be tried fairly in civilian courts, and that they will not face the death penalty. If states are unable or unwilling to return suspects to Lebanon, they should be brought to justice in their country of current residence, which is required under international law.  The commission should also disseminate its findings with respect to Israelis implicated in war crimes in south Lebanon, including descriptions of specific acts and incidents where perpetrators are not known and additional investigation in Israel is required. This would enable Israeli human rights lawyers and nongovernmental organizations to initiate their own efforts to pursue justice.  ***  We would welcome the opportunity to discuss these important matters with appropriate government officials in Beirut.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/07/27/corporate-social-responsibility","Corporate Social Responsibility","Corporate Social Responsibility","","07/27/2000","Having attended the opening session of the UN Global Compact, I am writing to suggest some ways to strengthen this effort and enhance its chance of improving corporate responsibility.  In our view, three obstacles threaten to impede the Compact's effectiveness: the lack of legally enforceable standards, the lack of a monitoring and enforcement  mechanism, and a lack of clarity about the meaning of the standards themselves. Human Rights Watch believes that the Global Compact represents a positive but limited first step. It could encourage corporations to act responsibly, but only if it is implemented effectively. In our view, three obstacles threaten to impede the Compact's effectiveness: the lack of legally enforceable standards, the lack of a monitoring and enforcement mechanism, and a lack of clarity about the meaning of the standards themselves. As you have noted, the Global Compact is a voluntary set of principles. It applies only to those corporations that choose to join the Compact, and even then, it does not bind them. We thus hope that the Compact is seen not as an end in itself but as a first step toward promoting a binding legal regime for corporate conduct, and that this regime is backed by an effective enforcement mechanism. Developing such binding standards and enforcement mechanisms would be consistent with a role that the UN traditionally has played in other areas. Moreover, as we saw in the case of corruption, there is a competitive dynamic that discourages some corporations from adopting socially responsible standards unless they are convinced that their competitors will do so as well. Much as the OECD did in the case of corruption, the UN can break through this competitive dynamic by using the multilateral forum provided by the Compact to develop a binding, multilateral legal regime for human rights, labor rights and the environment. We hope, under your leadership, that the UN will begin this process soon. Contrary to the assertion of some, it is not enough to suggest that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will assume this monitoring and enforcement function. Human Rights Watch has devoted substantial resources to promoting corporate respect for human rights, but our efforts are just a drop in the bucket. Neither we nor other NGOs begin to have sufficient resources to assume an enforcement role that should be the province of governments and the UN. In conjunction with the Global Compact, the UN released guidelines to """"facilitate … cooperation between the United Nations and the business community in a manner that ensures the integrity and independence"""" of the UN. While the guidelines prohibit partnerships with corporations that are """"complicit"""" in human rights violations, they do not define complicity. Do they address the complicity of doing business in a country that does not allow labor unions, or that legislates discrimination against women, or that uses abusive security forces to defend corporate property? We believe they should. But without defining the meaning of complicity, we fear that the guidelines could be applied arbitrarily and subjectively. To avoid tarnishing itself through partnerships with corporations that pay lip-service to the Compact but are nonetheless complicit in violations of its standards, clear, firm, and principled definitions of complicity should be developed promptly. To guard against the Compact becoming a forum for hypocrisy, the UN should also develop a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating corporate compliance. In the absence of such a mechanism, there is a troubling possibility that the guidelines could be misinterpreted, misapplied, or ignored. That would result in corporations being given what they might claim is a """"UN Seal of Approval"""" without having taken meaningful steps to implement the Compact's standards. We hope the UN will address this clear problem as soon as possible. In the process, we hope the UN will also actively highlight best practices among corporations as a tool to hasten the development of socially responsible corporate behavior. Finally, we encourage the UN to apply the Compact's guidelines to the UN's procurement and contracting activities. By living up to the Compact's principles in its procurement decisions, even in a limited manner, the UN could provide a powerful incentive for corporate responsibility and substantially strengthen the impact of the Compact on corporate behavior. Each year the UN issues some 135,000 contracts and procurement orders worth approximately $3 billion. The average contract is worth about $20,000, but about 2 percent of UN contracts are worth $1 million or more. Even if the UN were to extend its guidelines only to those contracts in excess of $1 million, it would provide a strong inducement for corporations to maintain high standards.  As the Global Compact continues to evolve, we hope that these steps will be taken to enhance its effectiveness. A Global Compact augmented by clear, legally binding standards that are monitored, enforced, and backed by the UN's procurement power would be extremely valuable.","Global","Economic Justice and Rights, United Nations"

""""This is a positive step, and we hope it is the beginning of a process that will finally empty Syrian jails of those unjustly imprisoned,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government should also immediately make public the names of those released.""""  It was not known if three Syrian human rights activists were among those being freed. Nizar Nayouf, Afif Muzhir, and Muhamed Ali Habib are serving long prison sentences imposed in 1992, following unfair trials in the state security court. The three men were active in a fledging human rights network in Syria known as the Committees for the Defense of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria (CDF). Nayouf was sentenced to ten years, and Muzhir and Habib to nine years. Nayouf, who is held in Mezze military prison, is known to be in poor health. Over the last several years Human Rights Watch and other international organizations have campaigned for his release on humanitarian grounds.  Freedom of expression and association have been severely restricted in Syria, and thousands were imprisoned in the last two decades for the peaceable exercise of these rights, many for membership in unauthorized political organizations. Syria has no law permitting the legal establishment of political parties, which forced opposition groups to operate clandestinely.  Presidential amnesties have steadily reduced the number of Syrian political prisoners to the current level of approximately 1,500 to 1,600, many of them arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured, and unfairly or secretly tried. In addition, there are possibly hundreds or more prisoners of Lebanese, Palestinian and other nationalities who were """"disappeared"""" in Lebanon and are known or believed to be in Syrian custody.  """"The government should continue to identify all persons imprisoned for nonviolent political offenses and release them immediately,"""" Megally added.  Human Rights Watch also recommended that the government take immediate steps to facilitate the resumption of normal lives by former prisoners. It said that the practice of arbitrarily denying passports should come to an end, and that the deprivation of civil rights that accompanied sentences handed down by the state security court should be rescinded. The practical effect of the rights ban, which under Syrian law begins from the day of sentencing to ten years after the expiration of the sentence, is that such individuals cannot vote, run for office, serve in the councils of syndicates, or work in the public sector.","Middle East/North Africa, Syria",""

The industry has been embarrassed by revelations about how some brutal rebel forces in Africa use gems to sustain their fighting. The United Nations has slapped diamond embargoes on rebel-held areas of Angola and Sierra Leone in the hopes of taming those civil wars. Diamonds are suddenly the issue of the moment. They're on the agenda at the G-8 meeting of big powers in Japan, and diamond giant De Beers announced recently that it no longer will sell """"conflict diamonds."""" The fact that public concern over serious human rights abuse can provoke upheaval in a multibillion-dollar industry is heartening indeed. But diamonds don't kill people, guns do. In the current enthusiasm for diamond embargoes, the long-standing arms embargoes on Angola and Sierra Leone largely are being ignored. If the world really wanted to stop the carnage in those countries, it would start by enforcing these arms embargoes. At Human Rights Watch, we have no evidence that the diamond embargo on Angola has made any appreciable dent in the revenue or ability to fight off the UNITA rebel force. Diamonds are easy to smuggle, and when mixed with stones of varying origins, they're almost impossible to identify under the standards required by a court of law. Once polished, their origin is undetectable. For all its flaws, an international certificate scheme for diamonds is a good place to start. But more important is to ensure that abusive forces never get weapons in the first place. To begin enforcing arms embargoes will require radically different behavior on the part of the U.N. and its member states. First, monitors must be deployed in any country under embargo to check suspicious shipments at border crossings, roads and airstrips. These monitors need to change location unpredictably to take smugglers by surprise. Second, a serious and well-funded inquiry must expose the sources of the weapons being smuggled--and the complicit companies and governments. For Angola, the U.N. deputized a commission led by Canadian Ambassador Robert R. Fowler to undertake such a probe. Its report, issued in April, had shortcomings, but it was a big step in the right direction. A similar commission authorized for Sierra Leone will need strong leadership and financial backing. Sierra Leone has been under an arms embargo since 1997, and neighboring Liberia, through which most of the rebels' diamonds and weapons flow, since 1992. These embargoes are a joke. In early June, there were press reports of two truckloads of weapons crossing from Liberia into Sierra Leone, as well as another shipment of a rocket launcher. Poking around on borders and identifying malefactors is essentially undiplomatic activity and not something the U.N. has been eager to undertake. Yet it must. The U.N. needs a permanent arms embargo unit with real investigative capacity and the mandate to keep hammering at governments that try to cover up their complicity. But not all the blame for lax enforcement can be laid at the door of the U.N. Individual governments also are at fault. Diamond embargoes are more attractive to them partly because the busy work of checking certificates can be done at home. Arms embargoes require sending outsiders into obscure countries to do dangerous work. To make a U.N. embargo binding on private companies and individuals, governments must pass """"implementing legislation"""" that incorporates it into domestic law. On the very day after the U.N. Security Council approved the diamond embargo on Sierra Leone, several countries immediately passed such legislation. Yet only a tiny handful of countries has put the Sierra Leone arms embargo into domestic law. The diamond trade and the arms trade are closely linked. The current debate over diamonds could help get to the heart of this dirty business, but not if it's used as a low-cost, low-risk publicity stunt to avoid talking about the real problem.","Africa, Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/07/20/mesa-de-dialogo","Mesa de Dialogo","Mesa de Dialogo","","07/20/2000","(Santiago) - Human Rights Watch welcomes the agreement reached on June 13 in the talks between human rights attorneys, religious leaders, members of civil society and representatives of the armed forces and the uniformed police, known as the Mesa de Dialogo. We are also pleased to note that on June 21, Congress, acting by an overwhelming majority, passed legislation enacting the agreement. The agreement offers hope that hundreds of Chilean families may know the fate of relatives who """"disappeared"""" following the 1973 military coup, after decades in which this information has been concealed by those responsible for their abduction, torture, and murder. However, it is now up to the armed forces and the police to comply with their agreement to provide the fullest information possible on the whereabouts or fate of the """"disappeared"""" within the stipulated six-month period. The value of the agreement depends on the armed forces keeping their word.  Those who collect or receive this information, both in the armed forces, the police and the churches, will be protected by professional secrecy. This means that they may not be bound to reveal their sources to the courts, and indeed are obliged to keep their identity secret. At the end of the six-month period the information will be provided to President Ricardo Lagos, who will ask the Supreme Court to appoint special judges to locate, exhume and identify the bodies and establish the date and cause of death.  While the law bars those who receive information from divulging their sources, it does not punish those who conceal information or refuse to cooperate with the courts. Participants in the Mesa de Dialogo discussed but were unable to reach a consensus on this point. This serious omission may be rectified in the future, however, as it was agreed that President Lagos may, after reviewing progress in implementing the agreement in six months' time, introduce """"complementary measures"""" if he thinks them necessary.  The norm of secrecy is intended to encourage those who have information to provide it without fear of self-incrimination. It does not restrict the action of the courts. The preamble to the implementing law passed on June 21 says explicitly that it is up to the courts to decide whether, or when, to apply Chile's amnesty law, which covers crimes committed between 1973 and 1978. While the dominant view in the judiciary is that the amnesty is applicable once the fact of death and the identity of those alleged responsible have been established, some judges have ruled the amnesty inapplicable since under international law crimes against humanity are not subject to amnesties or statutes of limitation. Given the scale and severity of the abuses committed under Pinochet, Human Rights Watch agrees with the latter view.  Nor does the amnesty law in any way allow the armed forces or the police to ignore the agreement's requirements. Since the amnesty law forms no part of the agreement, the armed forces or the police would be violating the terms of the agreement if they were to withhold information as a means of protesting court decisions adverse to their members or former members.  In what is perhaps the most important statement in the agreement, the armed forces and the police acknowledged """"the responsibility of agents of organizations of the State"""" for grave human rights violations during the military regime. Human Rights Watch welcomes this as the armed forces' first acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities committed under Pinochet's dictatorship. It is still not a perfect acknowledgement of responsibility, however. Notably, the language of the statement does not do justice to the fact, clearly established by the Rettig Commission in 1991, that the human rights violations were systematic and carried out as a matter of state policy. Moreover, the statement can be easily construed to mean that the agents who committed the abuses did not enjoy official support, whereas, in fact, the full resources of the state were used to cover up or legitimize crimes against humanity. In addition, the statement should have included a specific reference to the gravest abuses committed, such as """"disappearances,"""" extrajudicial executions, and torture.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

A test will be whether it uses the summit to address reform in China and Russia's war in Chechnya.   Neither topic will be easy, but progress could lay the groundwork for future efforts. It could also demonstrate Japan's willingness to take on tough questions involving promotion of democracy and human rights.   Japan has been more visibly active recently in its foreign diplomacy. Last year it exerted high-level pressure on the Indonesian government during the East Timor crisis. It has urged dialogue between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, and used its aid policy to press the Sri Lankan government to end abuses in the conflict with Tamil minority guerrillas.   But is Tokyo willing to use its diplomatic and economic clout with some of its most important neighbors and trading partners to promote broader international principles?   Japan is committed to encouraging greater economic openness and reform in China. It has strongly supported Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization. But it has been reluctant to openly criticize Beijing on its human rights record, despite the marked deterioration in conditions in China. A bilateral human rights dialogue between Japan and China under way since 1997 has yet to have tangible results.   At the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in April, Japan refused to co-sponsor a mildly worded resolution on China put forward by the United States, although it did vote against a ''no action'' measure by Beijing to keep the resolution off the agenda. Once again, China escaped international condemnation.   There is an urgent need for a multilateral approach to bring China's legal system and human rights practices into conformity with United Nations standards. The Chinese Communist Party's efforts to protect its monopoly on power continue to limit reforms and are a recipe for future political instability.   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and President Bill Clinton should use the opportunity of the Okinawa meeting to call on Beijing to take final action on two important UN human rights treaties China has signed but not yet ratified. The Group of Seven could also offer direct assistance to help reform China's labor laws, dismantle its ''re-education through labor'' system and build a modern, transparent legal system.   On the issue of Russia's abuses in Chechnya, the Okinawa meeting provides a particularly useful forum, with President Vladimir Putin participating in the political discussions. Japan is clearly interested in supporting reform in Russia. It has given emergency assistance to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist displaced persons fleeing Chechnya.   It should go further, urging Mr. Putin to fully comply with the recommendations of the UN Commission on Human Rights, and ensuring that this appeal is included in the Okinawa final statement.   The United Nations called on Moscow to carry out independent investigations and prosecutions in connection with atrocities committed in Chechnya, and allow unhindered access to Chechnya by UN officials.   The Okinawa meeting could give Japan a real boost in its international profile as a major partner shaping Group of Seven policy.

On Tuesday, July 17, 2000, eyewitnesses saw plain-clothes officers raid the home of Bahodir Hasanov and take him into custody for the fourth time in the past year. Days later, authorities still have failed to notify Hasanov's family of his detention and refused to give persons close to Hasanov any information about his whereabouts. One of Hasanov's acquaintances told Human Rights Watch that a National Security Service (SNB) representative responded to a query by saying, """"Find him yourself.""""  During previous detentions, police brutally beat Bahodir Hasanov; they also severely abused his father and brother, both of whom are in prison. Human Rights Watch fears that Bahodir is in danger of further torture and other mistreatment in detention. """"The first days in police custody are the most dangerous for someone held incommunicado,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The international community has to act quickly. They have to tell the Uzbek government to reveal Hasanov's whereabouts and allow him access to a lawyer and his family.""""  Authorities first detained Bahodir Hasanov in February 1999, when they planted bullets in his home and beat him to force him to confess they were his. According to a highly reliable source close to the case, they pushed him to the ground, kicked him, and pulled his head up by the hair, yelling """"Say it, 몀ujahid,' how many times were you in Chechnya?"""" 멝ujahid' is a term for an Islamic fighter.  Police held him incommunicado for four days at the station and threatened to kill him. Hasanov refused to incriminate himself and was released without being charged. But in September 1999, officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs detained Hasanov at his office at the Alliance Francaise, where he is an instructor in French. During interrogation, they punched him in the face and stomach and kicked him in the kidneys. Officers threatened to arrest and rape his wife, and to put his children in an orphanage if he refused to sign a statement incriminating one of his brothers. Authorities held Hasanov for 17 days on a trumped-up administrative charge뾵ithout notifying his family of his whereabouts뾞nd then released him. Two months later, in November 1999, police detained him again, failed to inform his family of his whereabouts, and then released him.  The Hasanov family, whose members are pious Muslims, is one of many targeted in the government's campaign of punishing families for the alleged misdeeds of their members. The campaign was launched in 1999, when Minister of Internal Affairs Zokiron Almatov announced that fathers would pay for the """"sins""""of their sons. Hasanov's younger brother Ismail, 27, and his 70-year-old father are both in prison on charges that are clearly motivated by their religious practices.  On November 18, police arrested Bahodir Hasanov's father on charges of possessing leaflets printed by the banned Islamic organization Hizb ut-Tahrir; eyewitnesses say police themselves planted the leaflets. During interrogation, according to sources close to the case, the elder Hasanov heard screams coming from the next room. Officers took Hasanov to the room, where he reportedly saw his younger son, Ismail, strung up by his ankles, being dropped on his head and beaten by police. Police told the elderly man that they could do anything they wanted with his son, even kill him, and no one would know. Ismail Hasanov's father agreed to sign a confession to put an end to the torture. Police later brought Ismail before his father, who had also been beaten. They threatened to continue to beat the elder Hasanov unless Ismail signed a confession, which he did.  But authorities did not release the elder Hasanov. On February 16, 2000, the Tashkent Regional Court convicted the 70-year-old man to three years in prison on charges of anti-constitutional activity, based solely on the leaflets supposedly found in his house. The elder Hasanov, a pious Muslim with no connections to Hizb ut-Tahrir, denied possession of the leaflets and insisted police conducted the search without a warrant and that they fabricated evidence. He even pointed out in the courtroom the officer who had put the leaflets in his home. According to those present at the trial, the judge paid no heed.  In Karshi prison, authorities allegedly treated Hasanov severely; they beat him and other prisoners convicted of anti-constitutional activities, labeling them """"enemies of the people."""" His three-year sentence was extended by six months on charges that he violated internal prison rules by not shaving his beard, a symbol of piety, and not removing his skullcap while passing a guard. Ismail Hasanov was accused of Islamic extremism and convicted in August 1999 of anti-state activities. Authorities included Ismail Hasanov in a new case against those suspected of affiliation with an alleged terrorist incident in the Yangiabad area of Uzbekistan, which took place in November 1999, when Hasanov was already in prison. Nonetheless, he was charged with having learned karate and studied Islam since 1997 with one of the alleged terrorists who died at the scene, and sentenced to 25 years in prison on terrorism charges. Human Rights Watch monitored his trial; no material evidence incriminating Hasanov was brought forth at trial or in the indictment. Hasanov denied involved in any kind of violence or anti-state activity.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

In the past six weeks, police have beaten opposition activists and members of Otpor (Resistance), an anti-government group mostly comprised of university students. Police have also refused to investigate attacks on opposition activists by plainclothes thugs believed to be working for the Serbian government.  Previously, police harassment of students and opposition activists was limited mostly to detention and interrogation.  """"The use of force brings the harassment of government critics in Serbia to a new and very dangerous level,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Since June, opposition activists face not only detention but also physical violence.""""  In May and June, the police detained and interrogated five hundred Otpor activists. This summer's beatings took place in police stations or in city streets, where government critics were placing anti-governments posters or simply wearing T-shirts with symbols of Otpor—a clenched fist—or opposition parties.  Since early spring 2000, the Serbian government has routinely referred to Otpor as a """"fascist"""" and """"terrorist"""" organization. The Federal Justice Ministry refused on June 9 to register the group into the registry of associations, public and political organizations.  The uncorroborated allegations of terrorism against Otpor are widely seen as an attempt by the government to suppress the increasingly popular group. Otpor has repeatedly demanded free elections in Serbia and carried out street actions ridiculing the government's policies. Numerous university professors, human rights activists, artists, church representatives, and members of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts have publicly supported the group or become its members.  Based on interviews with some of the beaten Otpor members and reports by Serbian independent media and non-governmental organizations, Human Rights Watch has .compiled a list of recent cases in which the Serbian government used violence or failed to investigate violence against those who were peacefully expressing their discontent with the state:  On June 9, four members of the Democratic Party (DS) in Zajecar were beaten at the local police station, where they were detained after putting up DS posters in town;  On June 10, in Barajevo, a group of DS activists were distributing brochures and leaflets in the streets when they were attacked by a group of individuals coming out of the office of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). DS members identified one attacker by name and reported the case to the police. The police refused to act upon the charge and blamed DS for """"insulting the president"""" in the leaflet;  On June 25, a policeman in the police station in Leskovac beat Bratislav Stankovic, while shouting that he had """"had enough of you democrats."""" Stankovic was arrested while riding a bicycle with an Otpor badge on his shirt;  On July 7, in Lapovo, the police beat student Nikola Lukic (19) in the police station. Lukic told the press that he was beaten from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. He was detained after the police searched his car and found an Otpor T-shirt and three badges with a clenched fist, the group's symbol;  On the same day, Otpor issued a press release stating that during a three-hour interrogation, a member of the State Security Service in Subotica physically attacked Otpor activist Marinko Varnjas, an asthmatic. Upon release, Varnjas had an asthma attack and had to seek medical attention;  On July 9, in Belgrade, a police inspector kicked Otpor member Tanja Zivanovic (18), during an interrogation of sixteen Otpor activists in the police station. The group was arrested while playing a soccer game and demanding resignation of the Yugoslav soccer team coach, as a metaphor for demanding the resignation of president Slobodan Milosevic;  On July 13, in Zemun, an inspector in the police station slapped Otpor activist Aleksandar Spasic when he refused to answer one of his questions during a four-hour long interrogation. Spasic had been arrested after a search of his house, where police seized Otpor material;  On July 15, a group of unidentified men in Sabac beat invalids Marko Vukovic and Marin Barjaktarevic, members of DS, inflicting serious injuries. Vukovic and Barjaktarevic were walking with their crutches and wearing T-shirts with the DS symbol when they were spotted by a group who were putting up SPS posters. The men used the crutches to beat the invalids, until the crutches broke. Vukovic's ribs were fractured as a consequence, and Barjaktarevic had internal injuries. The men claim that a police patrol quickly appeared but refused to pursue the attackers.  On July 17, in Kikinda, a policeman hit Otpor activists Srdjan Glisic twice on the head, while detaining him and his colleague Dijana Suboticki. The arrest took place while Glisic and Suboticki were putting up posters with the message: """"Resistance, because I love Serbia;""""  On July 18, in Sabac, police beat youth Otpor activist S.M., allegedly because he laughed while the police were putting him into a police car.

The former South African president is leading a new round of the Burundi peace talks, opening tomorrow. Burundian rebel groups, who are of critical importance to any efforts to end the six-year civil war, have said they will attend the talks only if the regroupment camps are closed.  The 35-page report, """"Emptying the Hills,"""" says that the Burundian government forced as many as 350,000 civilians into the camps. Although Burundi president Pierre Buyoya promised Mandela to close the camps by July 31, some tens of thousands of people are still living in them.  The report also details abuses of the National Liberation Forces (Forces Nationales pour la Lib?ation, FNL), a rebel group fighting the Burundian government.  Beginning in September 1999, Burundian soldiers forced civilians to leave their homes and to build temporary shelters of sticks, banana leaves, and plastic sheeting at designated sites, which often lacked water and sanitary facilities. Entire families have lived for months in the cramped one-room structures. Prohibited from going regularly to cultivate the fields upon which they depend for their livelihood, camp residents were forced to depend on international food donations which were often insufficient.  """"Burundian authorities said they put people in the camps to protect them,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"But people are more likely to die in the camps, from hunger and disease, than they are in their own villages.""""  Being sequestered in the camps did not protect civilians from the civil war, which was the government's stated purpose. The Human Rights Watch report said that when soldiers and rebels have fought in and around the camps, residents could not flee the fighting and some were shot and killed..Soldiers have tortured and killed suspected rebels found in the camps and have raped women residents, according to the report. They have looted the homes that camp residents were forced to abandon, even removing the metal roofs for resale in the capital, Bujumbura. They have also regularly required camp residents to haul water and wood for them and have used children as spies, porters, and helpers in pillaging operations.  The report also condemns violations of international humanitarian law by the FNL. """"The rebels have used the civilian camps as bases for attacking nearby military posts,"""" said Takirambudde. """"This exposes civilians to risk of injury and death and violates the rules of war."""" According to the report, the FNL have ambushed and killed civilians traveling in vehicles on roads near the capital and have killed others who refused to support their cause.  They have also abducted and raped women and have recruited children to serve in their forces, all violations of international humanitarian law. """"If the FNL is going to be a real partner in the negotiations, it must make its combatants obey international humanitarian law,"""" said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch called on international actors with influence in Burundi to step up pressure on the Burundian government to close all the camps before the July 31 deadline and to not resume forcibly displacing civilians, even if rebel activity increases during a period of heightened tensions surrounding the negotiations.

In particular, Human Rights Watch will focus here on four principle areas of concern. These are: 1. The reservations and """"interpretations"""" entered by Kuwait when ratifying the ICCPR. These, we believe, significantly undermine enjoyment of rights established in, and are not compatible with, the Covenant. 2. The exclusion of women from participation in public service and public affairs, including denial of the right to vote and stand for public office. 3. Restrictions on exercise of the right of freedom of expression. 4. The situation of the Bidun, who are not discussed in the state report, but whose right to residency and civil rights, including children's right to acquire nationality, remain a key issue of contention within the country.  I. Reservations Incompatible with the Object and Purpose of the Covenant Kuwait has entered three reservations(1) to the terms of the Covenant in an effort to justify the continued application of national laws that discriminate on the basis of sex or religion. The effect of these reservations and Kuwait national law on substantive rights is discussed in subsequent sections. Human Rights Watch considers all three reservations to be incompatible with the object and purpose of the Covenant, as discussed in the Human Rights Committee's General Comment 24. Kuwait's """"interpretive declaration"""" regarding the prohibitions of discrimination contained in Article 2 (1) and Article 3 states: Although the Government of Kuwait endorses the worthy principles embodied in these two articles as consistent with the provisions of the Kuwait Constitution in general and of its article 29 in particular, the rights to which the articles refer must be exercised within the limits set by Kuwaiti law. This reservation directly contradicts the Committee's position that it is unacceptable for states to enter """"a reservation to the obligation to respect and ensure the rights [of the Covenant], and to do so on a nondiscriminatory basis (Article 2(1)).""""(2) It also falls short of the Committee's requirement that """"reservations must be specific and transparent,"""" and """"should not systematically reduce the obligations undertaken only to those presently existing in less demanding standards of domestic law,"""" or """"seek to remove an autonomous meaning to Covenant obligations, by pronouncing them to be identical, or to be accepted only in so far as they are identical, with existing provisions of domestic law.""""(3) Kuwait's """"interpretive declaration"""" regarding Article 23 (family rights) and reservation to Article 25 (b) (voting rights) also attempt to improperly restrict its implementation of the rights in these articles where they contradict highly discriminatory existing national legislation. The reservation states that """"The provisions of this paragraph conflict with the Kuwaiti electoral law, which restricts the right to stand and vote in elections to males,"""" while the declaration states that """"the matters addressed by Article 23 are governed by personal-status law, which is based on Islamic law. Where the provision of that article conflict with Kuwaiti law, Kuwait will apply its national law."""" Kuwait's Personal Status Law 51/1984 discriminates on the basis of gender and religion,(4) while Kuwait laws on elections and nationality limit suffrage to a subset of male citizens.(5)    II. Violations Of Rights to Participate in Public Service and Public Affairs, and the Right to Vote And Be Elected Article 1 of National Assembly Members' Election Law 35/1962 restricts voting rights to male citizens over twenty of years of age. Article 6 of Nationality Law 15/1959 further limits rights naturalized citizens, who may not vote in a parliamentary election within thirty years of their naturalization, and who may not run for parliament or be appointed to a parliamentary body. Kuwaiti law also places restrictions on the right to association that seriously limit opportunities for participation in public affairs. Kuwaiti law provides no provisions for political parties, and has blocked efforts to form parties, in violation of Article 22 of the Covenant.(6) Furthermore, although Kuwait asserts that the activities of clubs and cultural societies """"constitute an important channel for the expression of opinion,""""(7) Kuwaiti law prohibits all clubs and associations from engaging in political activities.(8) The Human Rights Committee has stated that """"the right to form and join organizations and associations concerned with political and public affairs is an essential adjunct to the rights protected by Article 25."""" (9) In addition to these general restrictions, the rights of women wishing to participate in public affairs are further limited by Kuwait's prohibition of women voting or running for public office. Kuwait has entered a reservation to Article 23(B) of the Covenant, on the grounds that """"the provisions of this paragraph conflict with the Kuwaiti electoral law, which restricts the right to stand and vote in elections to males."""" Human Rights Watch believes this reservation is incompatible with Article 2(1) of the Covenant. In addition, we are concerned that this denial of voting rights severely undermines women's ability to """"take part in the conduct of public affairs by exerting influence through public debate and dialogue with their representatives or through their capacity to organize themselves,""""(10) a right and opportunity guaranteed every citizen in Article 25(a). Notwithstanding its statements to the contrary,(11) Kuwait also unreasonably limits women's access to public service in violation of Article 25(c) of the Covenant. For example, Kuwait's Judiciary Service Code at several points specifies that judges to be male, and in practice all judicial appointments are male.(12) Kuwait's denial of women's voting rights and limitations on access to public service also violate the Covenant's requirement in Article 26 that domestic legislation prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effect protection against discrimination. This violation is exacerbated by a provision in the Judiciary Service Code that states that """"courts may not consider sovereign actions of state,"""" which Kuwait has interpreted to include matters related to voting and nationality. (13) Recent efforts to challenge the ban on voting have been rejected in both political and judicial fora. In 1999 the National Assembly twice voted down legislation granting women the right to vote and stand for election. Cases brought by women who had attempted to register as voters during the February 2000 registration season have been either rejected outright(14) or suspended pending a decision by the Constitutional Court decisions on whether to hear arguments challenging the constitutionality of the National Assembly Members' Election Law.(15) As of July 11, 2000 the Constitutional Court had rejected requests to hear four such cases on the basis that the lower courts were premature in referring the cases. A fifth case, brought by a male activist, is expected to be heard when the Constitutional Court reconvenes in September 2000.  III. Undue Restrictions of the Right to Freedom Of Expression Kuwait's Constitution guarantees """"freedom of opinion and of scientific research,"""" but restricts the individual's """"right to express and propagate his opinion"""" to those actions taken """"in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified by law.""""(16) In practice, this has been used to stifle legitimate expression, particularly expression perceived as relating to religion, morality, or heads of government. Printing and Publications Law Restrictions on Expression Kuwait's National Assembly currently is debating amendments to Printing and Publications Law 3/1961.(17) Press accounts suggest that the amendments will restrict government powers to close newspapers administratively but leave untouched other provisions which have been used to restrict peaceful expression. These include several vaguely worded articles criminalizing expression deemed to offend public morality, disturb peaceful relations between Kuwait and other countries, foment dissent, or criticize God or the person of the Amir, even when it has not been shown to have had a negative effect on national security, public order, health, or morals. Section I of the law defines a publication as any """"piece of writing or drawing or musical piece or photograph or any other of the means of expression if it is able to be circulated.""""(18) The """"sale or distribution in any place of publications is not permitted except with a permit from the Printing and Publications Office.""""(19) Violations are punishable by a fine up to KD200 (US$650) and confiscation of the publication, except in cases where the publication """"includes anything that opposes the national interest or serves a foreign country or entity, or violates the political or social system in Kuwait"""" where the law provides for a punishment of up to six months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to KD200.(20) The language of Section III of the law, """"The Matters Whose Publication is Prohibited,"""" is similarly vague and open to abuse.(21) Article 23 prohibits publications that violate """"by allusion, slander, sarcasm, or disparagement God or the prophets or the companions of the prophet Mohammad""""; """"subject the person of the Amir to criticism""""; or """"attribute statements to the Amir without obtaining special written permission from the Printing and Publications Office."""" Article 27 prohibits publication of anything that """"incites committing a crime or foments hatred or spreads dissension among members of society."""" Article 24 prohibits not only """"publication of news about secret official communications,"""" but also """"publication of treaties and agreements undertaken by Kuwait prior to their publication in the Official Gazette except by special permission from the Printing and Publications Office. Also prohibited is the publication of anything touching on heads of state, or disturbing relations between Kuwait and Arab or friendly countries."""" Article 25 prohibits publishing """"news that affects the value of the national currency, or disturbs ideas on the economy. Also prohibited is publishing news of bankruptcies of businesspeople, commercial stores, currency traders, or currency exchanges, without a except by special permission from the relevant court."""" Article 26 prohibits any """"publication that violates public morality or persons' dignity or personal freedom, as well as any publication that reveals a secret that damages a person's reputation or wealth or his business name, and the publication of any thing intended to threaten him or force him to pay money or provide a benefit to another or prevent him from working."""" In cases where the materials prohibited in Articles 23-27 appeared in a newspaper, magazine or other periodical, the editor and writer are subject to imprisonment for up to six months and fines up to 1000 rupees for the first offense and up to one year in prison and 2000 rupees for a second offense. In cases where the editor or writer have previous convictions under these articles, the court can order up to one year imprisonment and a 2000 rupees fine, suspend the publication for up to one year and confiscate the issue in question, and revoke the publication's permit. (22) Publications risk judicial suspension and revocation of their permits for a wide variety of transgressions under Articles 29-31, which are subject to expansive interpretations and potentially violative applications. These range from """"incitement to overturn the ruling system in the country"""" to expression of """"opinions that include sarcasm, contempt, or belittling of a religion or a religious school of thought.""""(23) Finally, Article 37 allows the head of the Printing and Publications Office to ban imported publications in order to """"protect public order or morals or the sanctity of religions."""" Penal Code Provisions Restrictions on Expression The provisions restricting expression in the Kuwaiti Penal Code 16/1960 are similar to those in the Printing and Publications Law but provide for harsher penalties. Unlike the Printing and Publications Law requirement that prosecutions under Section III be brought within three months of publication, there is no statute of limitations for these Penal Code offenses, and separate phrases or images in the same work can be subject to multiple prosecutions. For example, Article 111 of the Penal Code punishes by up to one year of imprisonment and a one thousand rupees fine """"anyone who distributes, by any one of the public means specified in Article 101(24), opinions that include sarcasm, contempt, or belittling of a religion or a religious school of thought, whether by defamation of its belief system or its traditions or its rituals or its instructions."""" Article 204 sets a punishment up to three years' imprisonment and an up to KD3,000 (US$9,780) fine not only for """"anyone who publicly incites in a public place immoral acts and prostitution,"""" but also for anyone who """"prints or sells or distributes or exhibits pictures or drawings or forms or anything immoral."""" Although this article also states that """"there is no crime [committed] if statements were uttered or books or drawings or pictures published according to the accepted rules of science or art as that is the basis of participation in scientific and artistic advancement,"""" this provision has been ignored by the courts. See Appendix 1 for examples of recent prosecutions under these provisions of the Penal Code and the Printing and Publications Law.    IV. Discrimination Based on Origin and Status: The Bidun In its General Comment 15, the Human Rights Committee has said, """"the general rule is that each one of the rights of the Covenant must be guaranteed without discrimination between citizens and aliens. Aliens receive the benefit of the general requirement of non-discrimination in respect of the rights guaranteed in the Covenant, as provided for in Article 2 thereof.""""(25) The Committee has further stated that the term """"his own country"""" in Article 12 (4) """"embraces, at the very least, an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien,"""" and may include """"categories of long-term residents, including but not limited to stateless persons arbitrarily deprived of the right to acquire the nationality of the country of such residence.""""(26) There is a strong presumption that Kuwait is the """"own country"""" of most of the individuals referred to by the government of Kuwait as Bidun, and that Kuwait's systematic and persistent discrimination against them in a range of matters including the right to leave and enter their own country, and the right to register births and marriages, is in violation of the Covenant Kuwait as the Bidun's """"own country"""" There are approximately 120,000 Bidun resident in Kuwait. (27) An estimated 240,000 are living outside the country, many of whom would wish to return to Kuwait but have not been permitted to do so.(28) The term Bidun is short for the Arabic phrase """"without nationality"""" (bidun jinsiya), (29) and in Kuwait refers to longtime residents of Kuwait who would be eligible for Kuwaiti nationality by naturalization under the terms of Nationality Law 15/1959(30) but who have not been granted it. This group includes: 1. Individuals descended from nomadic groups whose ancestral lands are within the borders of present day Kuwait but who were unable to claim automatic citizenship under the Nationality Law because they could not prove continuous settled presence in Kuwait from 1920. 2. Individuals who could have registered as citizens under the Nationality Law and earlier citizenship regulations but neglected to do so. 3. Individuals who attempted to claim citizenship under the Nationality Law and earlier citizenship regulations and whose applications were accepted but never acted upon. 4. Individuals who migrated to Kuwait from nearby countries to work and over time lost effective links to and effective nationality in their country of origin, as well as children of such migrants who failed to establish nationality in their parents' country of origin. 5. Children of Bidun parents, including the children of Kuwaiti mothers and Bidun fathers. Until the mid-1980s the Kuwaiti government treated Bidun as lawful residents of Kuwait whose claims to citizenship were being considered, a status that distinguished them not only from other foreign residents but also from other groups of stateless residents, such as Palestinians from Gaza.(31) They were issued with documents identifying them as Bidun, and with the exception of voting rights they received all the benefits of full citizens, including subsidized housing, education, and health services. Bidun made up the vast majority of the rank and file of all branches of the police and military, and were eligible for temporary passports under Article 17 of the Passport Law of 1959. Intermarriage among Bidun and Kuwaiti citizens is common, and because of the vagaries of the implementation of the Nationality Law it is not unusual for a single family to have members with different citizenship statuses: automatic citizenship, citizenship by naturalization, and Bidun. Based on existence of these genuine, effective links to Kuwait, there is a strong presumption that most if not all of the Bidun, inside or outside Kuwait, will meet the test of """"special ties to or claims in relation to a given country"""" that make Kuwait their """"own country"""" with regard to the rights specified in Articles 12(2) and 12(4) of the Covenant. Arbitrary and Discriminatory Policies The Kuwaiti government subjects Bidun to a broad range of arbitrary and discriminatory policies, discussed below. Of particular note are policies regarding travel, entry, and registration of marriage and birth, which improperly restrict rights guaranteed in Articles 12, 23, 24, and 26 of the Covenant. Arbitrary Withdrawal of Rights and Benefits In 1985 the government began applying provisions of Alien Residence Law 17/1959 to the Bidun and issued a series of regulations stripping the Bidun of almost all their previous rights and benefits. In 1986 the government severely restricted Bidun's eligibility for travel documents; fired government employees not employed by the army or the police who could not produce passports, and instructed private employers to do the same. Restrictions increased in the aftermath of the 1990-1991 Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. . Bidun who fled to Iraq to escape the air war found themselves stranded there when Kuwait refused to allow the reentry of all but a few.(32) Bidun government employees were dismissed en masse, and only a small portion were later rehired. Bidun not employed by the government face tremendous difficulties in registering births, marriages, divorces, and deaths because they lack the required identification and are typically required to go through lengthy security checks before the Ministry of Interior will issue a letter of no objection.(33) More recently, in October 1999 the Ministry of Interior began a nine month program during which Bidun who signed affidavits admitting a foreign nationality and renouncing claims to Kuwait nationality could apply for a five year residency permit and other benefits.(34) After the program ended on June 27, 2000 the Ministry announced it would begin turning over files of Bidun who had not """"regularized their situation"""" to the Prosecution Office and seek deportation of individuals convicted of violations of the Nationality Law or the Alien Residence Law.(35) Prosecutions began on July 8, 2000.(36) Under Article 16 of the Alien Residence Law, non-Kuwaiti nationals can be deported if they have """"no recognizable source of livelihood,"""" if a court orders them deported after sentencing, or """"if the Minister of Interior believes that the deportation is mandated by public interest, public security, or public morals.""""   Issues of Particular Concern Kuwait's arbitrary refusal to allow the re-entry of many Bidun to Kuwait after 1991, and subsequent deportations of Bidun who claim Kuwait as their """"own country"""" are incompatible with Article 12(4) of the Covenant. In addition, the Human Rights Committee has stated that """"the right to leave a country must include the right to obtain the necessary travel documents.""""(37) Insofar as the Bidun lack an effective nationality, the responsibility to issue these documents has fallen on the government of Kuwait. Kuwait's severe and arbitrary restrictions on the circumstances for which it will grant Bidun travel documents, and the limited periods for which they are valid, are incompatible with Article 12(2) of the Covenant, and Kuwait has not provided any information to show that these restrictions are necessary for and proportional to the purposes specified in Article 12(3). Kuwait's failure to provide a legal mechanism for Bidun to register marriages undermines the enjoyment of the right to marry and found a family in Article 23(2) of the Covenant. Kuwait's failure to automatically issue birth certificates for Bidun children, as required by Article 24 (2) of the Covenant, create similar problems for families. Under the terms of Nationality Law 15/1959 only male Kuwaiti citizens have a right to pass on nationality to their children, and foreign and Bidun males are not eligible to apply for nationality based on marriage, in contradiction of the Covenant's requirement in Article 23(4) that states ensure equality of rights and responsibility of spouses. In addition, provisions that discriminate in granting nationality against children born to Bidun parents, and against children born to Bidun fathers and Kuwaiti mothers violate the right to acquire a nationality in Article 24 (3). The Human Rights Committee has said that """"States are required, both internally and in cooperation with other States, to ensure that every child has a nationality when he is born. In this connection, no discrimination with regard to the acquisition of nationality should be admissible under internal law as between legitimate children and children born out of wedlock or of stateless parents or based on the nationality status of one or both parents.""""(38)  V. Recommendations Human Rights Watch calls on the Human Rights Committee to: · Urge the government of Kuwait to withdraw its reservations and declarations regarding Articles 2(1), 3, 23, and 25(B) on the grounds that their incompatibility with the object and purpose of the Covenant makes them unacceptable. · Request Kuwait submit additional information on discriminatory legislation and practices limiting the enjoyment of the rights of the Covenant, with special attention given to discrimination based on sex, religion, national or social origin, and status. · Urge the government of Kuwait to take immediate steps to amend its domestic legislation to respect and ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant, without distinction of any kind. · Express its concern regarding Kuwaiti laws and practices which limit women's free enjoyment of the rights guaranteed in the Covenant, and urge the government of Kuwait to immediately amend those provisions of its Election Law, Judiciary Service Code, Nationality Law, and Personal Status Law which discriminate against women. · Express its concern regarding Kuwaiti laws and practices which unduly restrict legitimate expression, and urge the government of Kuwait to immediately amend its Penal Code and Printing and Publications Law to be consistent with the rights of the Covenant. · Express its concern regarding Kuwait's treatment of its Bidun population, and urge the government of Kuwait to refrain from discriminating against individuals under their jurisdiction on the basis of their being Bidun; to take immediate steps to ensure the full enjoyment of rights guaranteed in Articles 23, 24, and 26; the ensure to all individuals who can show genuine and effective links to Kuwait the full enjoyment of their rights under Articles 12(2) and 12(4). Appendix 1 Examples of Recent Prosecutions Expression Under Printing and Publications Law and the Penal Code Provisions Restricting Free Expression The provisions of the Penal Code and Printing and Publications Law are frequently used to prosecute journalistic writings deemed to insult the Amir of Kuwait, Islam or Islamic morality, and non-journalistic expression perceived to challenge a conservative interpretation of Islamic orthodoxy and morality. The vagueness in the law provides judges with a broad range for interpretation, and provisions in the Penal Code exempting scientific and artistic works are regularly ignored. The following are recent examples of such prosecutions. The Cases of Dr. `Aliya Shu`ayb, Laila al-`Othman, and Yahiya al-Rubay`an On March 26, 2000 the Misdemeanors Appeals Court found prize-winning novelist and short story writer Laila al-`Othman and publisher Yahiya al-Rubay`an to have violated Article 204 of the Penal Code and fined them KD1000 (US$3260) each for distributing al-`Othman's novel, al-Rahiil (The Departure). The court also found al-Rubay`an and Kuwait University philosophy professor Dr. `Aliya Shu`ayb guilty Printing and Publication Law violations for distributing Shu`ayb's collection of poetry, Anakib Tarthi Jarhan (Spiders Bemoan a Wound), without a permit and fined them each KD100 (US$326). Both books were ordered banned, although al-Rahiil had been published legally in Kuwait since 1984. Anakib Tarthi Jarhan had been in circulation since 1993. The March ruling overturned a January 22, 2000 Misdemeanors Court ruling sentencing Dr. `Aliya Shu`ayb, Yahiya al-Rubay`an and Laila al-`Othman, to two months in prison for writings that the court said """"included expressions that violate God, and indecent and shameless expressions,"""" but upheld the lower court's ruling that al-`Othman's book was immoral. The ruling did not specify what those expressions were but the writers and their lawyers noted that during questioning prosecutors focussed on a description of an apple in feminine terms in Dr. Shu`ayb's collection of poetry; a description of the """"lustful"""" coming together of sea waves in al-`Othman's novel; and a passage in the novel where a male character, in an expression of the depths of his despair, tells his roommates they can rape him. Dr. Shu`ayb has alleged that the charges against her were brought in retaliation for her academic studies on sexuality and lesbianism among students at Kuwait University.(39) The Case of Dr. Ahmad al-Baghdadi On October 4, 1999 the Misdemeanor Appeals Court sentenced Dr. Ahmad al-Baghdadi, chair of Kuwait University's Political Science Department and an expert in Islamic law and history, to one month of imprisonment for disseminating ideas that """"contained an extreme insult to and great defamation of the Prophet of God (Praise Be Upon Him)."""" The ruling overturned earlier court rulings sentencing Dr. al-Baghdadi to six months in prison for writing an article in a student newspaper that violated Article 111 of the Penal Code.(40) The article, entitled """"An Opportunity to Solve the Oppression of Backwardness"""" had appeared in the July 1996 issue of al-Sho`ula, a Kuwait University student newspaper. Dr. al-Baghdadi noted in the article that """"The Prophet (Praise Be Upon Him) failed in forcing Islam upon the society of Mecca for a period of thirteen years, whereas Islam entered the hearts of the Companions from the people of Yathrib or Medina before the arrival of the Prophet (PBUH) in Yithrib.""""(41) He also noted a historical continuity between the politicization of Islam beginning in the wars of apostasy down to the modern Islamist groups, expressed disapproval of legislation to prohibit co-education at the university, and called on students to oppose the Islamic tendencies. The initial charges against Dr. al-Baghdadi were based on complaints by individuals associated with a conservative Islamic movement, who said the Dr. al-Baghdadi had """"opposed the religious tendencies in the University and called upon the students to oppose the religious tendencies and that if they didn't they would be considered backwards and [Dr. al-Baghdadi] opposed the matter of forcing Islam on society and said that the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) had failed in forcing Islam on the society in Mecca for a period of thirteen years.""""(42) In each of the cases, the courts found Dr. al-Baghdadi's description of the Prophet Mohammad's proselytizing in Mecca as a failure to be decisive evidence of a violation of Article 111. As the Misdemeanors Appeals Court wrote, """"the Court views that what the defendant wrote in the article referred to had contained an extreme insult and great defamation to the bases of the Islamic creed, [lacking] the reverence and respect due from each Muslim to the Prophet of this [Islamic] community and its faithful messenger, [who is] the seal of the prophets and its messengers (PBUH), thus it is not proper that he uses reproaches which are used against humankind, or that he uses a description insults the dignity of the Prophet of the Lord of the Two Worlds, as the writer of this article had insulted morality with the messenger of God (PBUH) as he made from religion a cause of corruption of worship."""" Dr. al-Baghdadi, who was hospitalized during his imprisonment, received an Amiri pardon after serving fourteen days of his one month sentence - that is to say, one day before he would have forfeited his right to return to his university position on the grounds that he was absent without permission. Recent Actions against News Outlets Action taken against media outlets and journalists typically involve charges of insulting religion, morality, or the person of the Amir: · On February 14, 2000 the Council of Ministers revoked the permit of the daily newspaper al-Siyassa and suspended publication of the daily newspaper al-Watan for two years after they reported on an Amiri decree raising salaries of members of the military and security forces. The government denied that it had issued the decree, which had been faxed anonymously to the newspapers. After strong opposition by members of parliament who opposed the illegal intervention by the Council of Ministers, the government issued an Amiri decree revoking the Council of Minister's actions against the newspapers. · On October 18, 1999 the Council of Ministers suspended publication of the daily newspaper al-Siyassa for five days after the paper ran a front-page story quoting conservative Islamist figure Hamad al-Ali. Al-Ali's comments, which indirectly criticized Kuwait's Amir Shaykh Jaber al-Ahmad Al Sabah for issuing an Amiri decree granting women the right to vote, had been widely reported in other Kuwaiti news outlet but al-Siyassa was the only paper to display the story prominently. · On June 19, 1999 Kuwait's Ministry of Information closed the Kuwait office of Qatari satellite TV station al-Jazeera and revoked the permits of its staff in response to a live broadcast of a program on women's rights. During the broadcast a caller who identified himself as an Iraqi national criticized the Amir. The ban was lifted on July 31 after negotiations with the station. · On May 3, 1999 a court ordered al-Hadath magazine closed for one month and fined its editor Madi al-Khamees and columnist Saad al-Enezi KD50 (US$160) each for publishing an article that contained """"indecent phrases and words."""" · In January 1999 an appeals court overturned a weeklong suspension of the daily newspaper al-Qabas and six-month prison sentences against Egyptian cartoonist Ibrahim Marzooq and al-Qabas' then-editor, Mohammad al-Saqr. The two had been charged with insulting Islam after the newspaper ran a January 1998 cartoon showing God evicting Adam and Eve from Eden for failing to pay rent. The appeals court fined Marzooq and al-Saqr KD50 (US$160) each after Kuwait's Constitutional Court had refused to hear their petition challenging the constitutionality of the Printing and Publications Law.  1 Although Kuwait terms two of the reservations """"interpretive declarations,"""" the Human Rights Committee has previously noted that """"if a statement, irrespective of its name or title, purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of a treaty in its application to the State, it constitutes a reservation."""" General Comment 24, Fifty-Second Session, 1994, para. 3.  2 General Comment 24 para. 9.  3 General Comment 24, para. 19.  4 For example, Article 18 prohibits apostates from Islam from marrying; prohibits marriage between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim; and prohibits marriage between a Muslim man and a woman who is not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish.  5 See the discussion of voting rights, below.  6 See Kuwait's Initial Report, para. 261.  7 Ibid., para. 241.  8 Ibid., 249.  9 General Comment 25, The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service, Fifty-seventh Session, 1996, para. 26.  10 General Comment 25, para. 8.  11 See Kuwait's Initial Report, paras. 325 and 328.  12Article 19 of Judiciary Service Code 23/1990 does not explicitly require judges to be male, but subsequent articles on swearing in of judges and on appointment of chief justices and other positions in the court of cassation, appeals court, and court of first instance specify male judges.  13 Ibid., Article 2.  14 Four such cases were rejected on May 29, 2000. See for example Dr. Badria `Abdullah Mohammad Hadi al-`Awadi v. Deputy Minister of Interior, 165/2000 Administrative Department 1, where the court ruled frivolous Dr. al-`Awadi's argument that Article 1 of the National Assembly Members' Election Law was unconstitutional and rejected her argument that the registrar's refusal to register her was an negative act judicable in the administrative courts.  15 See for example the ruling on May 29, 2000 in Rola `Abdullah `Ali Hajiya Dashti v. Deputy Minister of Interior, 242/2000 Administrative Department 5.  16 Article 36, Constitution of the State of Kuwait  17 On June 10, 2000 the chairperson of the National Assembly's Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee announced that his committee had returned a draft of the legislation to the government for further amendments, and expected to receive a final version in approximately one month. """"The Legislative Branch gives the Government a One Month Deadline to Submit to it the Final Text of the Publications and Printing Law before its Promulgation"""". Al-Watan Newspaper, Kuwait, June 11, 2000 (Arabic).  18 Printing and Publications Law, Article 4.  19 Ibid., Article 7.  20 Ibid., Article 8.  21 Section III includes Articles 23 to 34.  22 Ibid., Article 28.  23 Ibid,, Articles 29-31.  24 Article 101 specifies """"speech, shouting, writing, drawing, pictures, or any other means of the means of expressing an idea.""""  25 General Comment 15, The Position of Aliens under the Covenant, Twenty-Seventh Session, 1986, para. 2.  26 General Comment 27, Freedom of Movement, Sixty-Seventh Session, 1999, para. 20.  27 Official figures for the Bidun population are difficult to obtain. According to Kuwait's official news agency, Minister of Interior Shaykh Mohammad al-Khaled Al Sabah told reporters that as of February 2000 the Ministry's Executive Committee on Illegal Residents' Affairs (also known as the Bidun Committee) had 121,216 registered individuals. """"The Legal Deadline for Settling Affairs of the Bidun Ends Next Tuesday,"""" Kuwait News Agency, June 25, 2000 (Arabic)  28 Estimate of population living abroad based on official estimates of a Bidun population of 260,000 at the time of the 1990 Iraqi invasion, with a conservative 3.5 per cent growth rate per annum.  29 In the 1980s the government also began using the term """"of undetermined nationality"""" (ghayr muhaddad al-jinsiya) to refer to this group, and since 1993 it has also used the term """"illegal residents"""" (muqimun bisura ghayr qanuniya). Despite the new official terminology, in meetings with Human Rights Watch in April 2000 officials from the Ministry of Interior continued to refer to this group as Bidun and distinguish between Bidun and other """"illegal residents"""" like visa overstayers.  30 Article 3 allows naturalization of the child of a Kuwaiti mother and an unknown father; Article 4 allows naturalization of residents present in Kuwait for at least twenty consecutive years (fifteen years in the case of Arabs from Arab countries), subject to other conditions; Article 5 allows naturalization of persons who rendered valuable services, children of Kuwaiti mothers and fathers who are POWs, dead, or have irrevocably divorced the mothers, and Arabs from Arab countries present in Kuwait prior to 1965 who have maintained their residence, as well as non-Arabs present since before 1930, all subject to other conditions; Article 7(bis) allows naturalization of adult children and grandchildren of naturalized fathers, subject to other conditions; and Article 8 allows naturalization of foreign women married to Kuwait men. Naturalization is at the discretion of the Minister of Interior, and only a small number of Bidun eligible to apply for nationality have received it.    31 For example, the number of Bidun was included in the total number of Kuwaiti citizens in the Ministry of Planning's Annual Statistical Abstract until 1988, when it was transferred to the alien population.  32 Although most of Kuwait's citizens left the country via Saudi Arabia during the war, Saudi Arabia rarely allowed Bidun entry and Iraqi authorities required them to surrender passports if they wished to cross to Saudi Arabia.

Civilians would receive five year residency permits and would not be required to have a Kuwaiti sponsor, and civilians and military personnel would 1) receive an amnesty from prosecution for violations of the Foreigners Residence Law (military and civilians); 2) be excused from the conditions in the Foreigners Residence Law for accompanying family members; 3) be allowed to continue in government or private jobs; 4) be allowed to continue to receive subsidized health care; and 5) pay only nominal residency permit fees.

However, we continue to believe that dialogue and exchange programs alone are insufficient, and we are deeply concerned that the China-E.U. bilateral dialogue has become largely a rhetorical shell, lacking in accountability, transparency, and clear benchmarks for progress. The E.U has acknowledged the lack of substantive progress on human rights while the dialogue has been underway, and has objected to the serious regression in recent months on some key human rights issues, such as freedom of association and religion.   Proposal Agreement to engage in a human rights dialogue should not foreclose other unilateral or multilateral initiatives in support of human rights in China. For this reason, we have been disappointed at the E.U.'s unwillingness to support action at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. In a serious dialogue and exchange of views, there will inevitably be fundamental disagreements. These cannot and should not be papered over or downplayed.  We propose that in order to make the China-E.U. dialogue useful in advancing a human rights agenda, the European Union take the following steps before agreeing to continue the talks with Beijing:  1) define in advance of the next round of dialogue meetings the human rights issues of most concern to the E.U. and make these public;  2) announce clear benchmarks for measuring progress and how these will be evaluated; e.g., through E.U. or U.N. delegations visiting China to make first hand observations, through NGO contacts, in reports and hearings before national parliaments in E.U. member states, or some other method. The E.U. should also commit to preparing an annual progress report to be issued in time for December debate by the European Parliament;  3) publish in advance a timetable for reaching the stated benchmarks, recognizing that there will be different time frames for different issues. The Chinese government should be urged to immediately refrain from making use of repressive laws. China could also fairly quickly provide statistics on death sentences or the names of all those serving time for """"counterrevolutionary"""" offenses and their places of detention, but reforming security laws to bring them into conformity with international standards would clearly take longer. 4) agree that the progress report and the European Parliament debate will form the basis for the E.U.'s position on whether to sponsor a resolution on China's human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva the following March, and agree that the E.U. will make that position publicly known in the month prior to the debate.  Human Rights Watch further proposes that the European Union place the following five priority issues on the China-E.U. dialogue agenda. However, rather than trying to comprehensively cover all of them in one large and unwieldy semi-annual dialogue, we suggest the creation of five smaller working groups, one on each issue, that would meet regularly with their Chinese counterparts in the appropriate ministries. These working groups should meet frequently and should have the capacity to meet quickly if a crisis situation occurs. They should be oriented towards making meaningful progress, not just exchanging views, and should be charged with recommending detailed step-by-step procedures for arriving at benchmarks. They should be required to submit reports to all E.U. member states, the European Council, and the European Commission in time for review and internal discussion before the next full semi-annual dialogue meeting.  It would also be useful to include in some working group sessions M.P.'s and M.E.P.'s and delegates from China's National People's Congress, as well as jurists, legal and labor rights experts, and diplomats from both the E.U. and China, in order to broaden the discussion and widen its possible impact.  We also suggest that the semi-annual China-E.U. human rights dialogue be conducted as stock-taking meetings based on input from the five thematic working groups, with high-level E.U. troika participation including the European commissioner in charge of foreign affairs. Priority issues Prompt ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The dialogue process should identify obstacles to ratification and aim to develop a program of legal assistance to deal with conflicts between existing Chinese law and the principles enshrined within the aforementioned documents. Reservations, if any, should be kept to a minimum.  Elimination of the death penalty. As a first step, we propose an immediate moratorium on executions. If there are technical objections to immediate abolition, further steps to that end should include a speedy process to achieve a significant reduction. Arrangements for access by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child to Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the boy recognized in 1995 by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama. He and his family """"disappeared"""" in May 1995 just after his sixth birthday. In December 1995, Chinese authorities recognized another child as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama and have insisted that monks and nuns recognize him on pain of expulsion from their monasteries. China's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child took effect in 1992. Review by a special commission of judges of the sentences of all those imprisoned for so-called counterrevolutionary crimes. Those who were sentenced under these laws should be released if they were convicted for conduct that is no longer criminal, if the review shows that the trials were biased or flawed, or if the suspects were not afforded minimum international fair trial guarantees. The process should be both credible and transparent. The revision of the Chinese Criminal Law, which went into effect on October 1, 1997, eliminated the crime of counterrevolution. However, an unknown number sentenced under the old law are still imprisoned. Chinese authorities stopped providing the relevant statistics in 1997, but it is estimated some 650 prisoners fall into the counterrevolutionary category. The names of some 200 sentenced in connection with events in May and June 1989 are known. A first step should be a complete listing of all those still incarcerated for counterrevolutionary crimes. The list should include name, home residence, alleged crime, length of sentence, court rendering verdict, and place of imprisonment. Abolition of all forms of administrative detention so that justice is delivered only by fully independent tribunals acting in an impartial manner. We recommend as a first step that the dialogue partners set up a committee of experts to review the """"reeducation through labor"""" (laodong jiaoyang) process whereby a committee is empowered to administratively sentence Chinese citizens to a labor camp or farm for up to three years, renewable for a fourth. The administrative detention process is arbitrary and often dependent on statements of Public Security Bureau (police) officials uncorroborated by independent evidence and with no opportunity for the accused to present a defense. In some cases, """"sentences,"""" are announced within a day of the initial detention. (See attached memorandum.)","Asia, China and Tibet",""

In the latest such incident, police officers in Philadelphia are being accused of beating a suspect, Thomas Jones, after a high-speed car chase. A videotape of the beating suggests that the police used excessive force in subduing Jones. """"When police officers are chasing after suspects at high speeds, it can get their adrenaline running,"""" said Allyson Collins, an expert on U.S. police abuse at Human Rights Watch. """"But that doesn't excuse abusive behavior. The police need special training to know how to check themselves after a chase."""" Collins said that post-chase incidents of brutality are too common. The 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles occurred after a car chase. In 1995, a police officer in Boston who was mistaken for a suspect was chased, and then beaten and abandoned at the scene. In 1996, police pursued undocumented Mexican migrants riding in a truck in Riverside County, California, and then beat some of the truck's occupants -- an incident that was also captured on videotape. Other post-chase cases in Atlanta, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., are documented in the July 1998 Human Rights Watch report on police abuse, Shielded from Justice. Several officers in the Philadelphia videotape were clearly attempting to stop other officers from hitting and kicking Jones. Those officers deserve recognition for behaving in a professional manner, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch expressed concern that police used a chokehold to take Jones to a transport vehicle after he was apprehended, although chokeholds are not permitted under Philadelphia police department rules. Human Rights Watch said that any officers found responsible for using excessive force should be disciplined appropriately, or prosecuted criminally if their conduct violated the law. It also urged the U.S. Justice Department, which has launched its own investigation into the incident, to step in and prosecute any officers who may have violated federal civil rights statutes.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

""""Egypt's international obligations require it to respect the rights of detainees which include to be informed promptly and in detail of the charges against them"""", the organizations said today. """"The charges brought against Saad El-Din Ibrahim and Nadia 'Abd al-Nur are so lacking in detail that they do not allow the defence to challenge the lawfulness of the detention order.""""  On 12 July and 13 July 2000, State Security Prosecution examined the charges against Saad El- Din Ibrahim and Nadia 'Abd al-Nur in separate sessions each lasting for several hours, and decided to renew the detention order.  The authorities failed to define these charges in relation to Egyptian law. Defence lawyers present at their first appearances before the State Security Prosecution on 1 July 2000 reported that charges focussed on several accusations, including receiving foreign funding without permission of the authorities, falsification of election documents and dissemination of false information harmful to Egypt.  Charges of receiving foreign funding without authorization are based on Military Decree No 4/1992 which carries a minimum of seven years' imprisonment. However, the prosecution has failed to indicate clearly and for all charges under what provisions of the Egyptian law they are being prosecuted.  In connection with the investigations against Saad al-Din Ibrahim and Nadia 'Abd al-Nur several other people have also been arrested and remain in detention. They include staff members of the Ibn Khaldun Center and Warda 'Ali Bahi, a staff member of Hay'at Da'am al-Nakhibat (Women Voters' Support Center), an NGO cooperating with the Ibn Khaldun Center.  The international human rights organizations called upon the Egyptian government: - to disclose information on the factual and legal basis for the charges against Saad al-Din Ibrahim and Nadia 'Abd al-Nur and all the others detained in connection with the case - to ensure that human rights defenders in Egypt can work in an environment without interference and harassment in accordance with the spirit of the UN Human Rights Defenders Declaration of 1998  Background According to Article 14 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Egypt is a member state, a detained person shall be """"informed promptly and in detail (...) of the nature and cause of the charge against him""""  According to the Egyptian Criminal Procedure Code, the prosecution can decide to extend the pre-trial detention period to up to six months, the maximum period after which a decision has to be taken on whether to proceed to trial. The Egyptian authorities frequently detain alleged political opponents for extended periods of pre-trial detention, in violation of international law. Over the past few months dozens of alleged Muslim Brothers have been detained under broad charges, such as """"membership of an illegal organization"""". In early July 2000 the total number of detained as alleged Muslim Brothers was reported to be more than 200.  Restrictive regulations on activities of NGOs have been used by the Egyptian authorities to harass and muzzle human rights defenders in Egypt. In February 2000 the Egyptian General Prosecution Office announced the referral to the (Emergency) Supreme State Security Court (ESSSC) of the case of Hafiz Abu Sa'ada, Secretary General of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights. He was charged with receiving funding without approval from the authorities, under a Military Decree No 4/1992 which carries a minimum of seven years imprisonment. Hafiz Abu Sa'ada, who was abroad when the referral was made public, subsequently received oral assurances from the authorities that his case would not be pursued and he returned to Egypt on 10 March 2000.

The attacks took place during the months of May and June in the towns of Makeni, Magburaka and Kambia and have resulted at least 27 civilian deaths and some 50 wounded civilians, as well as the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians. Human Rights Watch called on the Sierra Leone government and its British military advisors to ensure that government forces respect international humanitarian law and take the necessary precautions to protect civilians.     """"It is unacceptable for the Sierra Leone government to start dropping bombs on a crowded market place in the hope of hitting a small number of rebels,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The pro-government forces in Sierra Leone need to do more to minimize the impact of their military actions on the civilian population.""""     Displaced civilians from Makeni, located some 120 miles north-east of Freetown, and Magburaka, located fifteen miles southeast of Makeni, have described several air attacks on public places, including crowded markets. The actions of the helicopter caused a massive civilian exodus which emptied entire towns and villages. Aid workers and credible sources said the number of Sierra Leoneans seeking refuge in nearby Guinea doubled from 100 to 200 per day in mid-June following attacks around the Northern town of Kambia. Witnesses maintain the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) sustained few casualties in the raids.     In Makeni, the Government MI-24 gunship on May 31 dropped leaflets warning the RUF of a future air attack but attacked the center of town just minutes later. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that between seven and nine people were killed when a government helicopter attacked the central lorry park with bombs and gunfire. The victims included a pregnant woman; a twenty-nine-year-old pharmacist called Umar Bongo; Alhadji Jallo, aged thirty-three; and Ibrahim Conte. Some had rushed to collect the leaflets which had just been dropped.     It is possible that there may have been a legitimate military target near the market place shortly before the attack. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they saw senior RUF commanders as well as RUF vehicles, including one with a mounted anti-aircraft gun, in the vicinity of the market place just before the bombing.     Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions prohibits attacks targeting civilians and requires that armed forces take precautions to limit the dangers of attacks to civilian populations. ‘Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilians population' are prohibited. Military actions should be guided by the principle of proportionality; the attacker should refrain from launching an attack if the expected civilian casualties would outweigh the importance of the military target.     Forty-year-old Zainab from Makeni described seeing the bodies of four men and three women after the helicopter gunship attacked the crowded lorry park in the center of town on May 31. """"The bodies were torn apart, I could see that one of the women was pregnant. These bombs never hit [RUF] soldiers because they know by now how to hide from it. It only kills civilians. The rebels run to surrounding villages and hide, they mix with civilians.""""     Khalil, a thirty-one-year old vendor, described the May 31 attack in Makeni and related how rebels later forced him to bury the civilian dead, """"Close to where I was staying a house was hit. I went out and just near the house were the bodies of two young boys between the ages of twelve to sixteen. I then went out to the lorry park and saw the dead body of a man who used to sell tires at the Makeni market. Then about fifteen rebels approached me and a few others and ordered us to bury the dead. When we arrived at the graveyard after carrying two bodies, I saw four others bodies of civilians lying there waiting to be buried.""""     Seventeen-year-old Sahr was selling mangos when the gunship attacked Magburaka on June 7: """"The bombs and the leaflets came at just about the same time. I fled into a neighboring house to seek shelter. The bombardment seemed to last for about thirty minutes and when it was finished I went back to the market to take a look. I saw nine dead bodies; men and women and one child, a baby. I saw about eight injured people as well.""""     As the military effort in Sierra Leone is being advised, trained, and in some cases directed by British military forces on the ground, Human Rights Watch urged Britain to take a proactive role in ensuring that international humanitarian law is respected by the pro-government forces. In particular, parties of the conflict must distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and take the necessary precautions to protect civilians from attack.     Human Rights Watch also strongly condemned the continuing practice of both pro-government and rebel forces to extort """"taxes"""" from fleeing civilian populations. All witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported that they had been forces to pay a """"tax"""" to pro-government Civil Defense Forces (CDF) before entering the town of Mile 91, and civilians who fled through RUF-held territory described how they were forced to hand over personal belongings and money at RUF-controlled territory.     """"It is unconscionable that pro-government and rebel forces are stealing the last possessions from frightened, fleeing people,"""" said Takirambudde.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/07/10/human-rights-and-aids-crisis-debate-over-resources","Human Rights and the AIDS Crisis- The Debate Over Resources","Human Rights and the AIDS Crisis:  The Debate Over Resources","","07/10/2000","For well over a decade, the human-rights perspective has contributed to the evolving public-health understanding of how to address AIDS. We owe a particular debt of gratitude to the late Jonathan Mann, whom it was my privilege to know. He, more than anyone, highlighted the synergistic relationship between health and human rights.  He helped us understand that respect for the rights of people who are infected or at risk of infection by HIV is essential for preventing and treating the disease. If we risk discrimination, coercion, or breach of confidentiality, we are less likely to be tested, to seek treatment, or to learn how to avoid infecting ourselves or others. He also showed us that combating discrimination and social marginalization can help fight the vulnerability that handicaps many people, particularly women and girls, in their efforts to avoid infection.  Today, however, a new public-health challenge has come to the fore in the fight against AIDS. The issue is less what should be done to prevent or treat HIV infection than where we will find the enormous resources we need. Who should pay the cost of combating AIDS? In particular, does the industrialized world have an obligation to help the people of the developing world, and if so, what precisely is owed? Should obligations arising out of the AIDS pandemic differ from obligations arising out of other public-health crises or from the general need for basic health care?  None of these life-and-death questions admits easy answers. But international human-rights standards can help point a useful direction. The relevant standards are not the ones of civil and political rights – the issues of discrimination and individual freedom that so far have played the largest role in fashioning a response to AIDS. Rather, the pertinent standards are found in the less familiar terrain of economic and social rights.  The leading human rights treaty in this area is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Other human rights treaties are also relevant, but today I will limit my discussion to the Covenant. Adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1966, the Covenant has been ratified by 142 governments. I should note that, unfortunately, our host country, South Africa, as well as my own country, the United States, have signed the Covenant but not yet ratified it, evidently for fear of being bound by it.  The Covenant requires governments to respect the right to the basic necessities of human life – the right to such things as work, education, food, clothing, and housing. The most important right for our purposes is Article 12, which proclaims the right of everyone to enjoy """"the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."""" Among other steps, this right requires governments to prevent, treat and control diseases, and to assure medical care and attention to everyone in the event of illness.  As you can see, if this right were fully respected, we would be well on our way to solving the AIDS crisis. Treatment would be available to everyone, and effective prevention strategies could be widely implemented. Yet, obviously, we are far from that moment. Indeed, when it comes to AIDS, it seems almost a cruel joke even to assert the right to health because governments seem to accord it so little weight.  Why is this? Why do rights-based arguments seem so ineffective in convincing governments to provide the resources needed to fight AIDS? The difficulty is best illustrated by contrast with a more classic rights-based appeal – say, a demand to stop torture. Even in countries that practice torture, torture is shameful. By exposing a government's use of torture, we can shame the government to curtail this inhumane practice. So why can't similar public shaming be used to force governments to devote the resources needed to fight AIDS? It can, but the process is not nearly as straightforward. Let me explain why, and how we might proceed.  The difficulty with invoking economic and social rights is that the duty to respect them is far more qualified than the duty to respect civil and political rights. Governments are expected to uphold civil and political rights immediately. Moreover, responsibility for doing so is assigned almost exclusively to the national government of the country in question; there is no opportunity to pass the burden on to others. By contrast, the economic and social rights treaty allows its rights to be fulfilled gradually, over time. Each government is asked only to """"take steps"""" to secure these rights, and to do so only """"to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively [their] full realization."""" Moreover, the treaty assigns responsibility for compliance more broadly – not only to the immediate national government, but also to the international community as a whole, through the duty to provide """"international assistance.""""  This gradualism and shared responsibility make it much more difficult to shame a particular national government for its poor state of health care – or, for that matter, its inadequate education or housing. Governments can deflect criticism by blaming others. There is no easy way to move beyond this finger-pointing. Or, governments can simply assert that their current contributions, stingy as they might be, are all they owe to meet the AIDS challenge. Again, there are no clear benchmarks by which to rebut these claims.  So how, given these qualified, divided responsibilities, might we enforce economic and social rights? Or, more specifically for our purposes, how might we uphold a right to adequate AIDS health care? How do we move beyond the finger-pointing and evasions to hold particular governments responsible?","Global","Health, United Nations, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

""""Clinton's Landmine Legacy,"""" the new 42-page report from Human Rights Watch released today, details U.S. policy and practice on antipersonnel mines and recommends a dozen steps the president should take before leaving office.  The U.S. has said it will not join the Mine Ban Treaty until 2006, and then only if it has identified and fielded an alternative to the weapon. To date, 137 countries have joined the global ban on antipersonnel mines. """"President Clinton personally helped make the landmine crisis an issue of great international concern,"""" said Stephen Goose, program director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of walking away from an issue we know he cares about deeply, President Clinton should submit the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate."""" Goose urged Clinton to take executive actions to begin implementing a comprehensive ban, rather than waiting for the Senate to act.  The new Human Rights Watch report reveals for the first time that the U.S. has antipersonnel mines stockpiled in Qatar, which has already joined the treaty. The U.S. is also apparently planning to add to the stockpile in the near future. Goose praised the Clinton administration for making more resources available for humanitarian mine action programs. But he said that the United States is in some respects moving away from a mine ban as President Clinton nears the end of his administration. Perhaps most disturbing, the Pentagon is developing so-called alternatives to antipersonnel mines that would in fact be illegal under the Mine Ban Treaty.  Some elements of President Clinton's landmine legacy: --the U.S. is not among the 137 nations, including all of NATO except Turkey, that have signed the Mine Ban Treaty. Instead, the U.S. is keeping company with China, Russia, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Burma and Cuba; --the U.S. still insists on the right to use antipersonnel mines in joint military operations with NATO and other military allies that are party to the Mine Ban Treaty, which would put them at legal risk; --the U.S. is one of just sixteen antipersonnel mine-producing nations left in the world; -- the U.S. has the third or fourth largest stockpile of antipersonnel mines in the world, totaling more than 12 million; -- the U.S. still maintains antipersonnel mine stockpiles in a number of countries that are party to the Mine Ban Treaty, including Germany, Japan, Norway, Qatar and the U.K.; -- the Pentagon has plans to spend more than $820 million to develop alternatives to antipersonnel mines, but it is still very uncertain if the search will be successful at all, and it is increasingly clear that it will not be completed by 2006; -- sometime in fiscal year 2001, the U.S. is to make a decision about producing, at a cost of $150 million, a new mine system called RADAM that contains antipersonnel mines and would be prohibited under the Mine Ban Treaty; -- some in the Pentagon want to replace dumb (non-self-destructing) mines with a munition containing a """"battlefield override""""feature; this feature would revert the munition to dumb, indiscriminate status, and thus would be prohibited under the ban treaty. A production decision is expected in fiscal year 2002; -- the Air Force apparently has new plans to begin stockpiling Gator antipersonnel mines in Qatar, a party to the Mine Ban Treaty;  -- the Air Force has plans to upgrade the dispensers carrying Gator antipersonnel mines in 2005, even though the stated objective is to have alternatives to Gator in place in 2006.

Human Rights Watch has not yet had a response to its letter of July 2 asking Egypt's Prosecutor General for immediate clarification of the charges and evidence against Dr Ibrahim and two others then being held in preventive detention. They reportedly face charges of forgery relating to the forthcoming parliamentary elections, and Dr Ibrahim is further accused of unauthorized fundraising and accepting foreign funds with the intent of damaging Egypt's reputation domestically and internationally. The center was preparing a training video and planning to monitor the elections scheduled for November. """"Arresting activists and conducting late night raids on independent organizations is what is damaging Egypt's reputation,"""" said Hanny Megally, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division. """"These attacks are clearly intended to intimidate and hamper the work of independent non-governmental groups in the run-up to the elections."""" Such closures violate the basic right to freedom of association, which Egypt is committed to uphold, and are contrary to the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by consensus by the General Assembly in December 1998.

Dr Ibrahim and at least three others (Tamer Nabil, Ahmad Ata, and Tareq Hassan), are currently being held in al-Torah Prison. Nadia Abd al-Nour, a Sudanese national and finance director of the Ibn Khaldun Centre, is being held at the Women's Prison in Qanater. She had begun a hunger strike following her arrest on June 30 in protest against her conditions of detention and denial of access to family members. She was subsequently transferred to another part of the prison and allowed a visit from her brother, ending her hunger strike. Dr Ibrahim was allowed a visit by his wife. No information is available on the situation of the other detainees.

""""This is the most important human rights case in Senegal's history and we are behaving like a banana republic,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"Sacking and promoting judges in the middle of a sensitive case are shenanigans unworthy of Senegal's democracy."""" """"We will appeal this wrongheaded ruling,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations which initiated the criminal action against Habré in January. """"Today's decision and the bizarre maneuvers surrounding it are a slap in the face to Habré's victims who sought justice in Senegal."""" On Monday, it was announced the Superior Council of the Magistracy (Conseil superieur de la magistrature), presided by Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade and his minister of justice, had removed Judge Demba Kandji, who in February had indicted Habre, from his post as investigating judge. Just as Habré was regarded as an """"African Pinochet,"""" Kandji was Senegal's equivalent of Spanish judge Baltasar Garze, and his transfer was seen as a way for the government to block Kandji's continuing probe. It was also disclosed that Indicting Chamber President Cheikh Tidiane Diakhaté who delivered today's dismissal ruling, had been promoted to the State Council (Conseil d'Etat) while his court was deliberating the matter. The judicial transfers were ordered in an unscheduled meeting Friday of the Superior Council of the Magistracy. In today's decision, the three-judge Indicting Chamber ruled that Senegal had no jurisdiction to pursue charges that Habre was guilty of massive torture during his 1982-1990 rule in Chad because the crimes were not committed in Senegal. Human rights organizations said that the decision flouted Senegal's obligation under the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, to prosecute alleged torturers who enter its territory. Under the Senegalese constitution, international treaties, once ratified, override Senegal's legal code. Activists charged that since Wade's election in March, the Senegalese government has been trying to undermine the case. On January 28, under the previous government of President Abdou Diouf, assistant state prosecutor Abdulaye Gaye had given his formal approval to the prosecution of Habre. In May, however, assistant state prosecutor, Francois Diouf, called for the dismissal of the charges. President Wade appointed Habré's lawyer, Madické Niang, as a special legal advisor. On May 25, however, the Senegalese Bar Association ruled that Niang could not continue to appear before the courts while serving with Wade. Wade responded by naming Niang as a paid judicial consultant to the government, which the activists described as a """"subterfuge."""" """"The Senegalese government has made a complete about-face on this case,"""" said Brody of Human Rights Watch. """"It needs to explain to the world what is going on here."""" Today's decision also follows an intense lobbying and media campaign by Habré, who has reportedly spent lavishly in an effort to have the case dropped. The ruling was initially set for June 15 but was postponed until June 20 and then postponed again until today. """"The court could have applied the Senegalese constitution and the Torture Convention,"""" said Tine of RADDHO """"Instead it bowed to political pressure. It's a disgrace. But we are not giving up."""" The victims will now appeal the decision to the Cour de Cassation, Senegal's court of final appeal. In the meantime, however, the restrictions on Habré's movements could be dropped and he might be free to flee the country. On February 3, Judge Kandji, the chief investigating judge of the Dakar Regional Court, indicted Habré as an accomplice to torture, and restricted his movement to his Dakar neighborhoods. It was the first time that a former African head of state had been indicted for atrocities by the courts of another country. Kandji was planning to visit Chad to collect more evidence. Sixty Chadian victims are acting as private plaintiffs in the case as well as one Frenchwoman whose Chadian husband was killed by Habré's regime and the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), which represents 792 victims of Habré's brutality. In February, Habré's lawyers moved to have the case dismissed, arguing that Senegalese courts had no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Chad and that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. Chadian groups also reacted harshly to today's ruling. """"This is a dark day for Chad and for Africa,"""" said Delphine Djiraibe, President of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (ATPDH). """"But facts are stubborn things and the evidence of Habré's crimes is finally being presented to the courts and to the world. Hissene Habré has not seen the last of his victims."""" A 1992 Chad truth commission report accused Habre and his government of 40,000 political murders and systematic acts of torture and brutality. The truth commission president, Mahamat Hassan Abakar, presented his findings in May to Judge Kandji. Habré, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habré's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1986) Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habré was deposed in December 1990 by current president Idriss Deby, and has lived in Senegal since.","Africa, Chad",""

Only Israel and Turkey fully supported the U.S. text.     The delegates did agree to include a new provision aimed at keeping Washington engaged in talks on the court.

The repression intensified during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (March to June 1999), and has risen still after the war ended.  Second, since relations between the FR Yugoslavia and Western countries have deteriorated in the wake of the NATO war, Yugoslav authorities are now indifferent to Western criticism, including criticism for human rights abuses. The limited restraint in the harassment of domestic critics which the authorities displayed in the 1990s has now all but disappeared.  Human rights violations in Serbia have been so abundant lately that I can only enumerate the main types of violations in the opening statement. It would literally take hours to say more about each type and to dwell on the cases by point. 1. Repression of free speech  An important target of the government's repression is free expression and public debate. In the wake of NATO war, criminal and misdemeanor proceedings have been initiated against opposition politicians and ordinary citizens who have publicly or even privately criticized the authorities. Some cases resulted in convictions. Appeals in these cases are still pending, but the very fact that trials have taken place has a significant deterrent effect. Ordinary people, traditionally used to criticizing the authorities before their friends or colleagues, now face a genuine risk of prosecution for """"insulting the president"""" if they criticize Slobodan Milosevic in the presence of two or more people The Law on Public Information, adopted in October 1998, has had an even more chilling effect. The law authorizes misdemeanor judges to impose high fines on media found to have published """"libelous"""" statements or reports. Misdemeanor judges are appointed by the government and can be easily removed if they behave independently in politically """"sensitive"""" cases. As a result, judges identify libel only if petitioners are members of the three ruling parties in Serbia -- the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), presided over by Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav Left (JUL), led by Milosevic's wife Mira Markovic, and the extremely nationalistic Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Seselj. In some 70 cases in almost two years, officials belonging to these parties, or their supporters, have recovered damages from independent newspapers and electronic media for alleged assaults on their """"human dignity,"""" """"honor,"""" and their """"right to a private life."""" The fines paid by the media have been extraordinary high by Yugoslav standards and clearly aimed at crippling the media financially and curtailing free expression. In those blatant instances of libel in which opposition leaders have sued the pro-government media, misdemeanor courts resorted to various procedural pretexts to set aside the charges. In only very few cases were the government-controlled media punished, and even then the fines were much lower than those ordered to be paid by the independent media. As of January 2000, Serbian and Montenegrin independent media had been punished for violations of the media law on thirty-one occasions, and the average fine had been 420,000 dinars; pro-government newspapers were fined six times, with the fine averaging 143,000 dinars. The trend has only worsened since.  The government has always been in full control of the main national media -- the Radio-Television Serbia (RTS), but it has failed to establish an absolute monopoly in the area of public information. This is because in most large towns in Serbia, the authorities do not control the newspapers, TV, and radio stations founded by local assemblies, which since 1996 have been controlled by the opposition. There are also three major national newspapers -- Danas, Blic, and Glas Javnosti -- whose editorial policy is independent.  But the government since 1998 has been trying to establish full control, chiefly by refusing to issue licenses to the electronic media and by imposing enormous fines on newspapers charged with violations of the Law on Public Information. Two of the most important outlets, TV Studio B and Radio B-92 (later renamed into B2-92), were taken over by the authorities in May this year. Five more local radio and TV stations were closed down in May alone. Most of the independent media, however, have managed to survive so far, due to the persistence, invention, and courage of independent journalists, who are helped by financial support from abroad.  NGO activists, intellectuals, and journalists communicating with foreign colleagues have been prosecuted, or indirectly threatened with prosecution, for """"espionage."""" Two such cases occurred during the NATO bombardment, and one more was initiated just yesterday in Nis, where a journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, stands trial. He is charged with espionage and dissemination of false information because of articles he published in an English Internet magazine at the beginning of this year. The articles deal with crimes committed against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo during the NATO war and with the tensions in ethnically mixed parts of Serbia where the Yugoslav Army and police have been deployed after pulling out from Kosovo. In autumn 1999, peaceful demonstrations organized by the opposition or by university students met a violent police response. The riot police in Belgrade also beat peaceful protesters in May 2000, when thousands took to the streets reacting to the closure of TV Studio B and Radio B2-92. In some instances, the authorities engaged civilian thugs to disperse the protests.  Authorities have also resorted to other means to prevent opposition views from reaching a broad audience. During live broadcasts of parliamentary debates on RTS, speeches by opposition MPs are voiced over by the announcer. In the months preceding the takeover of Studio B, which is controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, the government disrupted the signal when news programs would air in the evening. Essential transmission equipment from a Studio B's transponder unit was stolen in January.  2. Attacks on Otpor and other opposition activists The main novelty in the government's strategies is police beatings of opposition activists and members of Otpor (Resistance), an anti-government group mostly comprised of university students. The police have also refused to investigate attacks on opposition activists by plainclothes thugs. In June and July ten such cases have been registered by Human Rights Watch, Serbian NGOs, and the independent media. The beatings took place in police stations or on city streets, where government critics were placing anti-governments posters or simply wearing T-shirts with symbols of Otpor—a clenched fist—or opposition parties. In one case, a police inspector kicked an 18-year girl during an interrogation of sixteen Otpor activists in the police station. The group was arrested while playing a soccer game and demanding the resignation of the Yugoslav soccer team coach, as a metaphor for demanding the resignation of president Milosevic. Also, a group of unidentified men in the town of Sabac seriously injured two people on crutches who are members of the opposition Democratic party, after beating them with their crutches; the victims, whose only fault was to wear T-shirts with the symbol of the party, claim that a police patrol quickly appeared but refused to pursue the attackers.  In May and June, the police detained and interrogated 500 Otpor activists and banned the group, accusing it of being a terrorist organization, an absurd charge. Otpor seeks peaceful political change through free and fair elections, and its activities consist of street actions aimed at ridiculing the government's policies. Numerous university professors, human rights activists, artists, church representatives, and members of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts have publicly supported the group or become its members. With one exception, Otpor activists have not been convicted or even tried for any violation of law, least of all for terrorism. The exception regards an ongoing trial in Pozarevac, the home town of Slobodan Milosevic and his wife, where an Otpor activist is being charged with attempted assassination of a member of the Yugoslav Left. Serbian human rights groups and independent media assess that the trial is politically motivated. Because of pressure exerted by authorities in Belgrade, the prosecutor and the investigating judge in the case resigned, unwilling to compromise their judicial independence and integrity.  3. Judicial system in Serbia The Milosevic government has sealed its authoritarianism through manipulating the courts. It exerts strong pressure on judges who appear impartial and professional, and benefits from those judges and prosecutors who require no prodding for their pro-government bias.  Prominent advocates of judicial independence in Serbia, including former judges of Serbia's Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, claim that a majority of judges in Serbia are still professionals whose only guide is justice and truth. The structure of the judicial system, however, enables the minority intimidated by, or loyal to, the executive branch to shape the performance of the judiciary in a decisive way. Presidents of the courts in Serbia are elected by the government-dominated Serbian parliament. These presidents then have an important role in running the court, since they can assign politically sensitive cases to """"reliable judges."""" Since juries strictly follow instructions by judges, decisions in political trials reflect the will of the government. Numerous trials of ethnic Albanians, arrested during the NATO war and then transferred to prisons in Serbia, were conducted in absolute disregard of fair trial requirements: as a rule, the indictees were convicted even though the prosecution did not produce any evidence to prove the case. A similar pattern emerged in several trials against political opponents in Serbia. The Supreme Court (which in Serbia does not rule on the constitutionality of a case: a separate Constitutional Court is vested with that power) has been more resistant to political influence, but most of the controversial cases decided by the lower courts since the NATO war have not yet reached the Supreme Court, and it remains to be seen how the court will act.  In December 1999 and July this year, the authorities carried out outright purges of the judiciary. The victims were two judges of the Supreme Court of Serbia, one judge of the Constitutional Court, and 17 judges of district, municipal, and commercial courts. All were removed by the Serbian parliament even though the Supreme Court had not pronounced upon the proposed removals, as required by law.  4. The political atmosphere in Serbia and the effectiveness of the political opposition As intimated at the beginning of this presentation, the steady decline of support for Slobodan Milosevic and his government is the probable principal cause of the increased harassment of government critics in Serbia. To illustrate the point, I attached below a review of opinion polls taken since October last year. All polls have shown a clear advantage in favor of the opposition -- if it is united. Five out of six agencies have found that the advantage neared the proportion of 2:1 (the sixth agency finds that the proportion is 1.2 : 1). The results are alarming to the government, and, as it seems, surprising even to the opposition and international observers, who have grown used to electoral victories for Milosevic and his allies since 1990.  The Serbian opposition is notoriously divided. The main obstacle to its efforts to achieve a change of government has been the rivalry between its leaders, notably between Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), and Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party. Currently, the critical difference within the opposition relates to the issue of whether the opposition should participate in the forthcoming federal and municipal elections. SPO advocates a boycott of the elections, whereas other parties think the opposition should participate. Interestingly, in the last elections in Serbia -- Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections in 1997 -- the SPO was the only opposition group which took part, thus neutralizing the effect of the boycott by the rest of the opposition. The SPO argues that in 1997 the conditions were more favorable for free and fair elections than they are today. Other opposition parties favor participation for two reasons. First, they say, while in 1997 a boycott would have damaged Milosevic's standing abroad, this time it would not, as Milosevic is no longer interested in the international response. Second, they believe there is simply no alternative to elections. Street protests and other forms of activities have proven insufficient to force Milosevic either to step down or to create conditions conducive to free and fair elections. The best the opposition can do, in this view, is to participate, as long as its capacity to control the electoral process -- and the vote-counting in particular -- is not so severely restricted as to render the participation meaningless. Finally, in the opinion polls the forces supporting Milosevic seem to lag so far behind that the opposition seems to be willing to tolerate the imperfection of the electoral process.  5. U.S. Policy  In the ensuing months we shall probably see more attempts by the authorities to prevent any meaningful elections from taking place, as such elections are likely to produce a defeat. Human rights violations, in that context, are almost certain to continue and intensify.  Direct leverage by the United States on the events in Serbia is close to nil, but the United States government can do things to help pro-democracy forces in Serbia. It can, for example, engage Russia in a dialogue on democratization and respect for human rights in Serbia.  In legislation, the U.S. should resist conditioning the lifting of sanctions on Serbia's membership in international institutions on the achievement of a lasting settlement in Kosovo. One can envisage a situation in which a democratic government in place in Belgrade might be unable to find a common language with the Kosovo Albanians, should the latter choose to pursue a maximalist position. In this kind of scenario, subjecting FRY to sanctions would be misguided. Instead, any conditionality should follow the spirit of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, which states that FRY should be required to show dedication to the process leading to an agreement on a settlement.  Finally, the U.S. government can pro-actively and directly encourage the development of democracy in Serbia in three ways. It can take steps to reduce the impact of sanctions on municipalities in Serbia in which nongovernmental organizations and independent media operate free of pressure from the local authorities. It can increase funding for training programs, technical development, and human rights awareness for the nongovernmental sector. And it can increase support for the nongovernmental sector and the independent media through such programs as exchanges and study tours.

Huang, who had maintained an Internet website exposing human rights abuses in China, has been detained since June 3, 2000, in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.  Because Huang Qi has not yet been put on trial, foreign companies have a rare opportunity to help bring about his release, Human Rights Watch said. """"The Internet is supposed to help bring freedom to China,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"But that's more likely to happen if foreign companies object to the punishment of Internet users trying to advance freedom."""" Human Rights Watch emphasized that China's attempts to control access to the Internet through politically-motivated regulations and detentions blatantly violate users' free expression rights. The Chinese government has blocked the websites of newspapers and dissident websites based abroad. Companies that fail to screen messages and to prevent users from posting certain kinds of information on the web could also be blocked. Internet users, including companies intending to use the Internet, are required by law to register with the police. While Internet and mobile technology are merging, foreign telecommunications and software companies are investing heavily in the development of China's Internet.  """"Internet companies are helping to provide Chinese people with an important new means of communication, enhancing their access to the free flow of information, and this is to be welcomed,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"But they should not turn a blind eye to users who are being censored, harassed, and arrested."""" On June 3, local police detained Huang Qi and his wife, Zeng Li. She was released after three days, but said that police told her Huang was being charged with """"subversion,"""" a charge which could result in his being imprisoned for life. Huang's website (www.6-4tianwang.com) existed for a year and grew out of an electronic billboard for missing persons. The website developed into a discussion forum where people reported human rights abuses neglected or ignored by the official Chinese press. On the eve of the eleventh anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, users posted increasingly critical messages, including an account by a mother who accused police of having beaten her son to death during the crackdown. Visitors to Huang Qi's web page were able to follow his own detention as it took place. At 5:05 p.m. on June 3, Huang, who operated under the name """"Nan Bo,"""" posted a message saying: """"Goodbye everyone. The Public Security Department summoned me for interrogation."""" Two minutes later, he reported: """"Four people of the Chengdu Public Security (bureau) came to summon me for interrogation. I told them to produce a written summons. I estimate that they will bring it in ten minutes."""" At 5:15 p.m., he posted his last message, """"The road is still long. Thank you everybody. Thanks to all who make an effort on behalf of democracy in China. They have come. Goodbye."""" Since commercial establishment of the Internet in China in 1994, the number of Internet users has grown to ten million, according to a recent report in the China Daily. Chinese authorities have issued an increasing number of rules and regulations to control its content. Regulations issued in January 2000, forbid users from """"exposing state secrets,"""" a charge that has often been used in the past to imprison dissidents and critics of the government. China's practice and laws classify an enormous range of information as """"state secrets,"""" including innocuous information already in the public domain. The secrecy laws have often been manipulated to imprison citizens who spread critical ideas and information outside of established channels. Internet users charged with violating China's strict security laws can face sentences of up to life in prison, depending on the specific provisions of the penal code under which they are charged. Websites found to publish offending material, if operated from within China, can be shut down at will by public security officials. Meanwhile, Qi Yanchen, one of the founders of the China Development Union, a non-governmental organization which was banned in December 1998, is awaiting verdict after a four-and-a-half-hour trial on June 2, 2000, in the eastern Chinese city of Cangzhou, Hebei province. Qi was detained for putting parts of his book, """"The Collapse of China,"""" on the Internet. Under a pen name, he also posted articles on the web about the spiritual Falun Gong movement, branded as an """"evil cult"""" and banned in July 1999, and about the China Democracy Party, banned in late 1998. He has been charged with subverting state power. Falun Gong practitioners have also been imprisoned in part for their use of the Internet to protest the suppression of Falun Gong or to spread the movement's beliefs.  Lin Hai, a software entrepreneur in Shanghai who provided an overseas electronic newsletter with 30,000 email addresses was sentenced to two years in jail on March 1998. He was charged with attempts to overthrow state power. Lin is belived to be the first person in China to be sentenced in connection with the Internet. He was released on September 23, 1999, six months early, after widespread international attention to his case.","Asia, China and Tibet","Free Speech"

The organization documented that at least five of the men, all civilians, were transported to a secret detention facility, where they were blindfolded and interrogated. These five have since been released, after being held incommunicado for up to one week. Families of other abductees have had no information about the whereabouts of their relatives. Human Rights Watch also learned that the brother of one kidnapped man is being sought, reportedly by Hizballah, and is afraid to return to Aitaroun. """"Citizens in south Lebanon should not have to live in fear of any group that takes the law into its own hands,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  Kidnapping is a criminal offense, and those who commit such crimes should be identified and brought to justice. Human Rights Watch urged the Lebanese government to condemn the kidnappings publicly and investigate the cases.  In some cases, the interrogators focused on the personal histories of the abductees, including the nature of their relationships with specific security officials from the South Lebanon Army (SLA), the Israeli-financed militia that rapidly collapsed in the wake of Israel's military withdrawal last month. For example, Human Rights Watch learned that interrogators sought to determine why one Aitaroun resident had been summoned to the SLA's security office in the village during the occupation, and if another man had met with an Israeli officer.  In at least one case, the kidnappers took steps to stifle any information about the reasons for the abductions. One man who was released and declined to provide his name told Human Rights Watch that he was questioned for four or five hours but could not say more than that. """"They told us politely not to mention anything about the content of the interrogation,"""" he said.  In separate interviews, several local residents speculated that the men were abducted and questioned on the basis of intelligence files left behind in the SLA's security office in Aitaroun after the withdrawal. These views were substantiated by the comments of a man who was released after one week. He told Human Rights Watch that he was interrogated three times while blindfolded and that it seemed his interrogator was making statements and asking questions based on information he was reading from a file. The wife of another victim testified that she visited HIzballah's office in Aitaroun and was told this about her husband: """"Don't worry. He is with us. They treat them very well and they are not beaten."""" The woman said that she was also told that """"every person who had a file in Aitaroun's SLA security office will be asked some questions and will return.""""  """"Private justice is unacceptable in a civilized society,"""" said Megally. """"If Hizballah is indeed responsible for these abductions, it must release the victims immediately.""""  Residents were frightened by the manner in which the kidnappings took place, in the hours just before and after midnight, when most of the victims and their families were asleep.  From eyewitnesses accounts obtained by Human Rights Watch, it appears that the twenty men may have been abducted by separate groups of kidnappers. For example, in one case four armed men entered the house, did not conduct a search, but watched as the victim dressed. In another case, three armed men in civilian clothes arrived at the house but only one entered and instructed the victim to """"come with us for one hour."""" In a third case, five men in civilian clothes who said they were from Hizballah came to the house; only two entered and a third stood by the door, holding a rifle. This house was not searched, and the kidnappers said that they wanted the victim to go with them """"for five minutes.""""  Eyewitnesses provided additional details to Human Rights Watch about the kidnappings of three men still missing as of June 22:  Hussein Habib Khoreizat, 35, was taken from his home at about 11:30 at night on June 6. Men who identified themselves as Hizballah knocked at the door and demanded to be let in. Four entered the house and searched the rooms and closets, but did not remove anything. There were two cars outside the house. Hussein, dressed in pajama pants and a T-shirt, was then taken to one of the cars. The men said that he would be returned in five minutes. Since that time, his family has had no information on his whereabouts. Hussein reportedly did not serve in SLA, but one source said that SLA operatives had pressured him to serve as an informer. When he refused, they tore up the permit that allowed him to travel to Beirut from the occupied zone.  Mohammed Khoreizat, who is in his thirties, was abducted at about 11:45 p.m on June 6. Men who identified themselves as Hizballah knocked at the door and rang the doorbell, asking if Mohammed was home. They searched the house but did not confiscate anything. Mohammed was allowed to change out of his sleeping clothes and went with the men, who said that he would be back in five minutes. The family inquired about Mohammed with the security arm of Hizballah and the Lebanese army, who said they knew nothing about his case. Human Rights Watch could not ascertain if Mohammed had links of some kind to the SLA, but the militia attempted to forcibly conscript his brother Hasan in 1993. Hasan fled, and as a consequence his father was detained for three days in the SLA's security office in Aitaroun.  Shawki Sheikh Hussein, 25, was abducted from his home at approximately 2:45 on the morning of June 7. According to eyewitnesses, the family was awakened by knocking at the door. Four men entered the house while another two waited outside. The men, who were wearing military clothing and dark sunglasses, identified themselves as Hizballah. They asked for Shawki, and then searched the house. Two cars were outside the house and two other cars were on the road. Shawki was led to one of the cars and a sack was placed over his head. Since the kidnapping, the Lebanese army post in nearby Tibnin and the state security office in Bint Jbeil both reportedly said they have no information of his whereabouts. Two days after the abduction, several local policemen reportedly acknowledged that they knew about the case, but the next day the local police station said there was no information.  Shawki's brother Nabil was in the house at the time of the kidnapping. The next day, Hizballah reportedly came asking for Nabil, and returned several times, most recently on June 16. Nabil is afraid to return to Aitaroun.  It is unclear why Shawki was targeted. He completed compulsory military service in the Lebanese army, but prior to that, in 1994, the SLA forcibly conscripted him. His 67-year-old father described to Human Rights Watch how he was pushed to the ground and injured when he tried to prevent the militiamen from taking his son. Shawki's mother said she tried to follow the jeep and was also shoved and pushed to the ground. According to his parents, Shawki was held for one month at the SLA training center in Majeediyye and harshly beaten for refusing to wear the SLA military uniform. They said that he still has scars on his arms from cigarettes that were extinquished on his flesh. Shawki's brother Bilal was interrogated by the SLA for two hours in 1994, and then expelled from the occupied zone the next year, when he was eighteen years old. He completed compulsory service in the Lebanese army and did not return to Aitaroun until the Israeli withdrawal was completed in May. Since his brother's kidnapping, Bilal is also afraid to set foot in Aitaroun.  Human Rights Watch has documented SLA practices in the occupied zone that were in contravention of international humanitarian law, including forced recruitment of men and children into the militia, the expulsion of individuals and entire families, and torture of detainees held without charge in Khiam prison. Expulsions and torture are war crimes under the Geneva Conventions.","Middle East/North Africa, Lebanon",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/06/25/yes-world-court","Yes A World Court","Yes, A World Court","","06/25/2000","The debate over a permanent international criminal court is coming to a head. The Clinton administration is threatening to walk out of U.N. deliberations in New York unless its proposal to exempt U.S. citizens is accepted by June 30. Meanwhile, Sen. Jesse Helms and his Republican allies have introduced a bill threatening sanctions against governments that support the court. No one expects the United States to embrace the court anytime soon. Benign neglect is the most that can be hoped for. But the vehemence of U.S. objections is founded in part on important misconceptions. These are illustrated by Fred Hiatt's column """"Internationally: War Crimes Sanctimony"""" [op-ed, June 19]. By providing a forum to prosecute the authors of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court is designed to curtail the impunity that has fueled the worst atrocities of our time. Hiatt charges that the court will in fact have the opposite effect by discouraging military intervention to stop such crimes. The remote possibility that the court could prosecute American military personnel, he contends, might ensure that the United States """"never stages a humanitarian intervention again."""" Recent history refutes that claim. The Pentagon willingly participated in bombing campaigns over Serb depredations in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1999. Yet in each case, U.S. troops were subject to prosecution by the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal. Indeed, the tribunal arguably posed a greater threat to U.S. forces than the international criminal court, because any tribunal decision to prosecute would have superseded the views of U.S. authorities. The court, by contrast, must defer to conscientious investigations by national authorities, even if they decide against prosecution. Hiatt compares political supervision of the court unfavorably to that of the Yugoslav tribunal. The tribunal, he asserts, must be """"sensitive to political ramifications"""" of its actions because it was created by the U.N. Security Council. But the court, he claims, """"will operate with almost no external checks and balances."""" Here again he is mistaken. The Security Council's capacity to rein in a hypothetical runaway tribunal is limited by the veto power of the council's permanent members. China or Russia, as well as Britain and France, could single-handedly block U.S. efforts to curb an inappropriate tribunal prosecution. The prosecutor of the international criminal court, by contrast, can be dismissed for misconduct by a simple majority of the governments that ratify the court's treaty. Moreover, before the need for such a political check even arose, a defendant alleging inappropriate prosecution by the court would be entitled to review by up to three separate judicial panels. For an example of the caution that marks these international proceedings, consider the tribunal's treatment of NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. As Human Rights Watch documented in an extensive report, NATO's violations of international humanitarian law were responsible for roughly half the 500 civilian deaths caused by NATO bombs. Yet, after careful reasoning, the tribunal found no basis to charge war crimes. The best way to ensure similar caution by the international court is for the U.S. government to embrace it and play a central role in shaping its culture, as it did with the tribunal, rather than snub it. Many U.S. opponents of the international criminal court focus on its power to prosecute nationals of states that do not ratify its treaty. But that is no different from treaties on terrorism and drug trafficking that permit prosecution of offenders regardless of the views of their native states. Hiatt would prefer a court that is restricted to cases referred by the victim state or the Security Council. But victim states are often ruled by their abusers, who are not about to turn themselves in for prosecution. And the permanent members of the Security Council have been so preoccupied with protecting friends and allies that they have blocked the establishment of international tribunals for such worthy candidates as the Iraqi government or the Khmer Rouge. The broader jurisdiction of the international criminal court is needed. The court has more than adequate guarantees against the unwarranted prosecution of an American. But the U.S. government wants more: an ironclad guarantee against any prosecution of an American, whether warranted or not. Such an exemption would sabotage this landmark institution for combating the worst human rights crimes of our era. It would be antithetical to American ideals of justice and to the universality that is key to the court's legitimacy. It should not be sought or granted.","United States",""

But though Mexico has made important strides toward electoral fairness, it's important to realize that the country's human-rights record is not keeping pace. Without the institutions to support a solid democracy, especially a trustworthy justice system, Mexico's vaunted political transformation will fail to deliver on its promise of a better future. The sorry state of human rights in Mexico is no secret. Mexican and international human-rights groups routinely chronicle Mexico's serious human-rights shortcomings, as do the United Nations and Organization of American States. The litany of abuses makes for alarming reading: torture, extrajudicial killings, """"disappearances,"""" arbitrary arrest, labor-rights violations and more. Far from offering refuge from abuse, Mexico's courts are part of the problem, as even the U.S. Department of State noted in February: """"Corruption, inefficiency and disregard of the law are major problems. The wealthy and the powerful generally benefit from impunity."""" The results are disastrous, not only for real or alleged opponents of the government, but for accused criminals, everyday citizens unlucky enough to get swept into the criminal justice system and the large portion of the population particularly vulnerable to abuse, such as indigenous people and children. Elections alone will not remedy these problems. If all human-rights violations in Mexico resulted from central government dictates, perhaps a change of leadership would suffice to end widespread abuses there. But they don't. In fact, the decentralized nature of Mexico's political system exacerbates the problem, which goes far beyond the actions of a few bad cops and a few indulgent politicians. Police, soldiers, prosecutors, judges and the politically powerful are able to exercise arbitrary authority--nationally, regionally or locally. Mexico's federal system of government makes this widespread abuse even more difficult to control, with 31 separate state-level political, police and justice systems. Advances in human rights, therefore, will come about only if all branches of government get involved. - Mexico's executive should start by commissioning an honest appraisal of the human-rights situation, including a review of how and why official human-rights initiatives have not met their goals. - The Mexican Congress should review legal codes and precedent to effectively prohibit the use in court of evidence obtained through human-rights violations, including torture. - Judicial officials should overhaul the system of public defenders so defendants have an effective voice with which to denounce abuse. While the government has taken steps to address human-rights violations in recent years, its efforts have been too timid at best, and some of its policies have been just plain counterproductive. Unfortunately, Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, has not only failed to promote a human-rights agenda he has spoken out against basic rights. In an effort to court the get-tough-on-crime vote he said on the campaign trail last month, """"Let it be known that the law was made to protect the human rights of citizens, not criminals."""" And why not? A similar slogan worked last year for a successful PRI gubernatorial candidate. Such verbal swipes are taking place throughout the country. For his part, opposition candidate Vicente Fox, from the National Action Party, has not made human-rights improvements a campaign theme. However, he recently released an interesting reform proposal suggesting major structural changes to the justice system. For those proposed changes to be effective, though, Fox would have to pay a lot more attention to human-rights issues as president than he has as a candidate. U.S. policymakers should realize that human-rights problems undercut Mexican economic development and counter-narcotics efforts, among the chief policy goals of the United States. However, the government deserves credit for allowing the Federal Electoral Institute, an autonomous government agency, to oversee federal elections free from the influence of party officials. Substantive problems with the elections may yet surface, like how the IFE handles the hard-to-watch rural vote, and the way that authorities manage accusations of fraud if the election results hang in the balance. Nonetheless, the advances to date have been real. Free and fair elections without an improvement in human rights sells democracy short. The sclerotic Mexican political system has seemed so immutable for so long, all positive change is welcome. But Mexico can win the battle for clean elections and still lose the war for human rights.","Americas, United States, Mexico",""

Part of that agreement includes a plan to monitor the government's oil revenues. Why is this a human rights issue? In the past, the Angolan government has used oil revenues to finance covert arms purchases that undermined the spirit of the Lusaka Peace Accords. The arms are being used to continue a vicious civil war in which hundreds of thousands of civilians have lost their lives over the last decade and nearly 10 percent of the population (about 1 million people) were displaced by the renewed conflict.  These covert arms purchases bypassed the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and were routed instead through the state oil company (Sonangol) and the Office of the Presidency. For example, to fund some arms purchases during 1998, the government used approximately U.S.$870 million of funds that had been generated from signature bonus payments on oil exploration and offshore concession blocks. Human Rights Watch is also concerned about the use of oil revenues to purchase indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel landmines—even after the government signed the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997. The IMF's monitoring agreement represents a positive first step in establishing transparency and accountability within the government of Angola. However, the agreement is limited in its scope, and therefore requires certain follow up steps, including: * The full cooperation of all parties with relevant information about oil revenues, particularly the government and the oil companies operating in country, with the IMF-appointed monitors to ensure that the monitoring program is effective. * Public disclosure of the scope and scale of the monitoring agreement as well as the government and monitoring program reports detailing the use of oil revenues. * The negotiation of an agreement between the IMF and the Angolan government to fully audit any discrepancies between expected and real revenues, if such discrepancies emerge during the course of the monitoring agreement. Such agreements should ensure that oil revenues are not used to purchase indiscriminate weapons such as antipersonnel landmines.","Americas","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

Human Rights Watch criticized the legislation in letters on Wednesday to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg, and Knesset committee chairs Amnon Rubinstein and Dan Meridor. While sharing concern over the fate of Israelis missing in Lebanon, the organization said that there is no acceptable justification for committing war crimes.

Lower courts have since ordered the release of all but two of the hostages, Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani. A ruling on their case has been postponed until July 12, apparently to allow the introduction of yesterday's legislation.  """"Israel's highest courts have acknowledged that the Lebanese hostages are held illegally."""" said Hanny Megally, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"The Knesset should not attempt to sidestep the courts.""""  Israel kidnaped Lebanese nationals `Obeid and al-Dirani from Lebanon in 1989 and 1994, respectively. Israeli officials admit that the two are being held for future use in negotiations to gain the release of Israeli nationals gone missing in Lebanon. As such, their detention is both a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a violation of Israel's legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They should be immediately released.  Human Rights Watch also criticized the sweeping language of the legislation, which provides almost unlimited powers to the military to detain civilians arbitrarily and indefinitely. This raises serious concerns that the legislation could be used to detain persons based on their political beliefs, and not for any actual acts they have committed.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

Makhmudov, 57, was jailed in 1999 for supporting a banned opposition political party.  Makhmudov recently received a distinguished Hellman-Hammett award, which honors writers who have suffered political persecution.  In August 1999, the writer was sentenced together with five others to fourteen years in prison on trumped-up charges of participating in a """"criminal society"""" and using the mass media to publicly insult the President of Uzbekistan, among other charges. At his trial, Makhmudov stated openly that he had been tortured, and gave further detail about the abuses in a written appeal to international organizations. Torture and mistreatment is rampant in Uzbek prisons, but Makhmudov is believed to have been subjected to particularly harsh treatment in retribution for his candor.  Recent reports indicate that in May, Makhmudov—together with one of his co-defendants—was transferred to the notorious prison in the northern city of Jaslyk, known among Uzbek human rights activists as """"the place from which no one returns.""""  In Jaslyk, Makhmudov is said to be suffering from pain in his chest, sides, and back—where he has been beaten—and to have lost consciousness in prison several times. He is reported to face punitive treatment, including being forced to sit crouching for extended periods of time with his hands behind his head. He has received inadequate food and medical treatment.  The writer's work was suppressed during the Soviet period, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Uzbek government honored Makhmudov with the Cholpan Prize for his most famous novel, The Immortal Cliffs. The Cholpan Prize is an award named for a poet killed in Stalin's purges. Makhmudov soon fell out of favor with the authoritarian government of Uzbekistan, however, when he supported fellow writer Mohammed Solih's bid for the presidency in 1991. Solih heads the opposition political party """"Erk"""" (Freedom), which is now banned in Uzbekistan.  Makhmudov was first arrested in 1994 when his house was raided and police produced a firearm as evidence that he was guilty of terrorism. This charge was greeted with widespread disbelief and dropped. Next he was charged with embezzlement and sentenced to four years in prison. An international campaign was mounted on his behalf, and when no evidence was produced he was amnestied and released. In February 1999, after a series of car bombs exploded in Tashkent, plainclothes agents arrested Makhmudov on the street and held him incommunicado for three months. He """"reappeared"""" in May to face the charges that have currently landed him in prison.

""""The U.N. must set up a credible, even-handed, and well-funded court to bring to justice the perpetrators of atrocities in Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The international community must also cut off the supply of arms to the rebels and their illegal trade in diamonds which is fueling the war.""""   Since the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) took more than five hundred U.N. peacekeepers hostage and restarted offensive actions against the Sierra Leone government in early May, Human Rights Watch has documented a renewed surge in abuses by the RUF, including the first testimonies of amputations since the July 1999 Lomé peace accord, as well as numerous cases of rape, widespread looting, abductions, forced recruitment of child soldiers, and summary executions. Disturbingly, U.N. peacekeepers have on several occasions abandoned civilians to their fate without making any attempt to protect them from RUF attack.   The letter to the members of the U.N.

Human Rights Watch asks the Security Council to strengthen UNAMSIL's mandate requiring it to take all necessary measures to protect civilians within its areas of deployment.  Justice: Human Rights Watch believes that justice for Sierra Leone would be best served by the establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone. Whether this is the case or a tribunal is established under Sierra Leonean law, any tribunal must meet minimum standards of due process and fairness. In the attached memo, Human Rights Watch has advanced twelve principles that it believes are necessary for any credible and legitimate justice effort. Additionally, the process established must focus on human rights crimes committed by all sides of the conflict, and not only on the responsibility of RUF rebel leader Foday Sankoh. Diamonds and Arms: Human Rights Watch supports a U.N. mandatory ban on direct and indirect imports of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and the call for U.N. member states to adopt national measures implementing the diamond embargo and making violators subject to stiff penalty. Additionally, to effectively stem the flow of diamonds from and arms to rebel-held areas the U.N. must order an inquiry into illegal arms flows to the RUF rebels, modeled after the U.N. International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda), also known as UNICOI, and drawing on the recent experience of the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola, which has investigated sanctions-busting in Angola. We thank you for your kind attention to these important issues.  Sincerely,  Peter Takirambudde Executive Director, Africa Division Joanna Weschler U.N.

Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and for a short while appeared to threaten the capital, Freetown. Fighting between pro-government forces and the RUF has resumed, reigniting the civil war that began in 1991 and was supposedly ended in July 1999 with the conclusion of a peace accord in Lomé, Togo.   The U.N. Security Council should reconsider the situation in Sierra Leone in light of the changed circumstances on the ground. Human Rights Watch believes that it should have three priorities: ensuring the protection of civilians; providing for justice for human rights abuses; and cutting off the supply of weapons to the RUF.   Human Rights Watch, which has had a permanent research presence in Sierra Leone since April 1999, has documented a resurgence in abuses against civilians by the RUF since full-scale fighting resumed in early May; previously we had reported continuing abuses at a lesser scale since the peace accord. Recent abuses include the first testimonies of mutilations since the signing of the Lomé peace accord in July 1999, as well as rape, summary executions, abductions, widespread looting, and the recruitment of child soldiers (often from among those demobilized under the terms of the Lomé accord). Disturbingly, UNAMSIL troops have on several occasions reportedly abandoned civilians to their fate without making any attempt to protect them from RUF attack.   These reports underline the importance of protecting civilians as the first priority of the international and government forces operating in Sierra Leone. The aim of the international forces should be to create an ever-expanding zone in which civilian safety can be ensured and there is """"zero tolerance"""" of human rights abuse by any party to the conflict. For some time to come, Sierra Leoneans will necessarily count on the international community to provide security against the RUF and other abusive forces; international troops under UNAMSIL must have the mandate, the training, and the means to ensure this protection effectively.   The civil war has fed on a cycle of impunity by which the quickest route to power has been through the commission of atrocities for which there have been no consequences. The lesson of the breakdown of the Lomé accord is that repeated amnesties do not buy peace: those responsible for orchestrating the killings, rapes, mutilations, and abductions that have characterized the war must be brought to justice. The United Nations, a chief broker and """"moral guarantor"""" of the Lomé accord, and its member states, have a particular obligation to see that justice is finally done. Human Rights Watch believes.that the best route to justice for Sierra Leone would be the establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone (ICTSL) along the lines of the international tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Whatever process is established, it must be able to ensure trials of those responsible for the most serious abuses by all sides dating back to 1991, when the war began, and observe minimum standards of justice and fairness.   Although the Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Sierra Leone in 1997, and modified it in 1998 to apply to rebel forces only, it has not taken responsibility for the enforcement of this sanction or for the investigation of reported breaches. Human Rights Watch believes that it is essential that the Security Council specifically provide for measures to enforce the embargo, including the deployment of monitors along the border with Liberia, and that it undertake to investigate alleged violations thoroughly. Key to halting breaches of the embargo will be steps to control the flow of smuggled diamonds from Sierra Leone with which the RUF apparently has been able to purchase weapons.  Recommendations  Human Rights Watch urges the Security Council to take promptly the following steps:  Strengthen the mandate of the troops deployed under UNAMSIL to provide protection to civilians, and give the troops the means to do so. In particular UNAMSIL should be required to take all necessary measures to protect civilians within its areas of deployment, and to use its best efforts to expand the zone within which it is able to protect civilians. UNAMSIL should direct its attention most urgently to areas where there is clear evidence that RUF forces continue to commit serious abuses, such as Masiaka, Makeni, Port Loko, Lunsar and the Yelibuya peninsula. Strengthen the role of the civilian human rights unit of UNAMSIL. That unit should have the mandate and resources to: investigate and publicly report on human rights abuses by all sides to the conflict in Sierra Leone, including the RUF, pro-government forces, and UN troops; establish responsibility for abuses by identifying the direct perpetrators and those with command responsibility; inform the relevant disciplinary and judicial authorities of abuses, and press for accountability; and monitor and report on the efforts of the relevant authorities, domestic and international, to discipline or punish abuses. The unit's work should be well integrated into the larger UNAMSIL mission, and its findings and recommendations should be given due weight by UNAMSIL's military and political components. Require UNAMSIL to work with the Sierra Leonean government to put in place disciplinary and other procedures to prevent violations of international humanitarian law and other abuses by pro-government forces including the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the Civil Defense Forces. Confirm that the Security Council does not recognize the amnesty granted in the Lomé accord insofar as it purports to apply to international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, in line with the reservation attached to the accord by the Special Representative of the Secretary General at the time of its signing. Establish an effective and fair process to bring to justice those alleged to have committed crimes of this type, under procedures that meet minimum international standards of due process and fairness, as set out in detail below. Human Rights Watch believes that the most effective way to ensure such justice is by the establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone. The process established must focus on human rights crimes committed by all sides to the conflict, and not only on the responsibility of RUF leader Foday Sankoh. Reaffirm the commitment of the U.N. to the establishment in Sierra Leone of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a National Human Rights Commission, as provided for in the Lomé accord, but clarify that this is no substitute for a penal tribunal. Provide for the U.N. to give substantial assistance to the re-establishment of an independent and effective Sierra Leonean justice system, including the training of judges and administrative personnel. Impose a mandatory ban on direct and indirect imports of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to ensure that proceeds from this trade cannot be used by rebels to purchase weapons. This ban should apply to all diamond transactions not authorized by the government of Sierra Leone through an effective certification regime. The Security Council should explicitly call upon U.N. member states to adopt immediately national measures implementing the diamond embargo and making violators subject to stiff penalty, and furthermore should ensure that the embargo applies to all diamond transactions, including those arranged under previous contracts.  Order an inquiry into illegal arms flows to the RUF rebels, modeled after the U.N. International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda), also known as UNICOI, and drawing on the recent experience of the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola, which has investigated sanctions-busting in Angola. This inquiry should be specifically mandated to investigate the trade in arms and diamonds from and to rebel-held areas in Sierra Leone, including through visits to countries implicated in embargo violations. The inquiry should be conducted by a panel of experts selected for their investigative experience. Panel members should be provided with clear terms of reference, adequate resources, and full cooperation from governments, regional and international organizations, and international law enforcement officials. The preliminary results of the investigation should be made public at the earliest possible opportunity in order to identify the channels of supply, expose violators, and devise strategies to halt illicit arms flows.  Provide for the rigorous enforcement of the arms embargo imposed on the RUF, including by the deployment as soon as possible of well-equipped U.N. forces to monitor borders (especially with Liberia), roads, and airstrips bordering on rebel-controlled areas and halt any weapons shipments they detect.  Require the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone overseeing the arms embargo to take proactive steps to investigate possible breaches of the embargo and to make public its conclusions and recommendations in relation to those breaches. Create a new Arms Embargo Unit within the U.N. to monitor the implementation of international arms embargoes, in consultation with the U.N. sanctions committees. This unit, once established, would provide a permanent investigative capacity otherwise available only on an ad hoc basis through the creation of investigative panels.   Human Rights Watch calls on the member states of the U.N. to:  Provide effective financial and other support to the U.N. operation in Sierra Leone and independently for projects aimed at ending human rights abuses in the country, including the reconstruction of the Sierra Leonean justice system. Send investigators to Sierra Leone immediately, in consultation with the U.N. and the Sierra Leonean government, to collect evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both before and after the Lomé accord.  The Civil War in Sierra Leone  The Sierra Leonean civil war began in March 1991, when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) entered Sierra Leone from Liberia, launching a rebellion to overthrow the repressive and corrupt one-party rule of the All Peoples Congress (APC). Under the leadership of Foday Sankoh, a corporal in the Sierra Leone Army who had been imprisoned in 1971 for his alleged involvement in an attempted coup against the APC, the RUF was originally made up of a mixture of middle-class students with a populist platform, unemployed and alienated youths, and Liberian fighters from Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). The ideological component to the movement, however, was never clearly actualized, and the rebellion quickly developed into a campaign of violence whose principal aim appeared to be simply gaining access to the country's diamond and mineral wealth.   Since the outbreak of the war, the country has been marked by instability. In 1992, APC President Joseph Momoh was overthrown in a military coup by Captain Valentine Strasser, whose National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) ruled until it was itself overthrown in 1996, by his deputy, Brigadier Julius Maada Bio. Later in 1996, however, multi-party elections were held and won by Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, head of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), who pledged to bring about an end to the war. The RUF and Kabbah's government signed a peace agreement in November 1996, the Abidjan Accord, which called for a cease-fire, disarmament, demobilization, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The cease-fire, however, was broken in January 1997 when serious fighting broke out.   In May 1997, President Kabbah was overthrown in a coup led by army major Johnny Paul Koroma, heading the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). Koroma cited the government's failure to implement the peace agreement as the reason for the coup. Upon taking over, the AFRC suspended the constitution, banned political parties, and announced rule by military decree. It also ushered in a period of political repression characterized by arbitrary arrests and detention and widespread human rights abuses. President Kabbah and his government fled into exile in neighboring Guinea.   The AFRC had significant support within the Sierra Leonean Army (SLA), which had become disillusioned by President Kabbah's decision to cut back support for the military. The SLA accused Kabbah of putting greater confidence for the country's defense in and giving more economic resources to a network of civilian militias, known as the Civil Defense Forces (CDF), the largest and most powerful of which are the Kamajors. Formalizing an alliance between the army and the rebels based on joint opposition to President Kabbah and the SLPP, the AFRC invited the RUF to join them in the new government.   In August 1997, following the AFRC's announcement of a four-year program for elections and return to civilian rule, which represented a breakdown in negotiations for the return of Kabbah, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) put in place an almost total embargo against Sierra Leone. From March 1997, Foday Sankoh was held in custody in Abuja, Nigeria, after being detained as he entered the country, supposedly on firearms offenses. In October 1997, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution imposing mandatory sanctions on Sierra Leone, including an embargo on arms and oil imports.   In February 1998, the largely Nigerian ECOWAS peacekeeping forces known as ECOMOG, working together with Kamajor militia and claiming to act under a defense pact with the Sierra Leone government, launched an operation which drove the AFRC/RUF forces from Freetown. In March 1998, President Kabbah was reinstated as president and over the next several months ECOMOG forces were able to establish control over roughly two-thirds of the country, including all regional capitals. However, in a series of offensives in late 1998, the rebels managed to regain control of more than half of the country, including the diamond-rich Kono district and several other strategic towns and areas. From this position, the RUF, in alliance with the AFRC and dissident members of the SLA, launched a brutal attack on Freetown in January 1999. During the attack on Freetown, the combined rebel forces (RUF, AFRC, and dissident SLA) carried out massive abuses, including the amputation of the hands of hundreds of civilians, as well as widespread rape and summary killings.   Although the assault on Freetown was eventually repulsed, the Sierra Leonean government, faced additionally with the threat by Nigeria to withdraw its troops, had no choice but to reopen negotiations with the RUF. On 18 May, 1999, the Sierra Leonean government and RUF signed a cease-fire agreement, which came into effect on 24 May. Foday Sankoh was released from custody by the Nigerians and participated in negotiations. On July 7, 1999, a peace accord between the RUF and the Sierra Leone government was signed in Lomé, Togo, of which the government of Togo, ECOWAS, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the U.N., and the Commonwealth were described as """"moral guarantors."""" The accord provided for the RUF to be transformed into a political party and brought into government, with Foday Sankoh as vice-president and chair of a Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development. ECOMOG was to be withdrawn, and the Security Council was requested to amend the mandate of the civilian U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL), present in Sierra Leone since June 1998, and to authorize the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops to oversee a process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of rebel and government forces and reconstruction of national armed forces.   Only on October 22, 1999, did the Security Council finally adopt a resolution (1270) establishing UNAMSIL and authorizing a force of 6,000 military personnel, including 260 military observers. Two further resolutions followed in February and May 2000, amending the mandate of the force and increasing the authorized troop strength to 11,100 and then 13,000. Even once resolution 1270 was adopted, it took months for U.N. troops to arrive. By the end of April 2000, after the Nigerian government finally began to implement its longstanding decision to withdraw substantial numbers of its troops (though Nigerians still form a large component of UNAMSIL), the number of U.N. soldiers had reached only 8,700.   The implementation of the Lomé accord was marred by delays in nearly all of its key components, including disarmament. Serious human rights abuses continued. The RUF and other dissident elements within the AFRC and SLA never showed any serious commitment to the peace process. Human Rights Watch continued to document serious human rights abuses and regular violations of the Lomé accord. The RUF continued to abduct and train child soldiers during the peace process, suggesting that it was preparing for a return to hostilities. Because the RUF was in continued control of Sierra Leone's rich diamond areas under the Lomé accord, it had access to the necessary funds to maintain its war machine. However, the international community largely ignored the serious human rights abuses committed by RUF rebels during the peace process and their leaders' demonstrable lack of commitment to the Lomé accord.   In early May 2000, RUF rebels took hostage several hundred UNAMSIL peacekeeping troops, seizing their weapons and vehicles, and full-scale fighting resumed. When the fighting appeared to threaten Freetown, several hundred British soldiers were rapidly deployed to Sierra Leone, in the first instance to evacuate foreign nationals desiring to leave, but also to secure the airport, allow reinforcement of the U.N. contingent, and assist in the reorganization of the pro-government forces as an effective fighting force. The release of the hostages has been secured, with the assistance of the Liberian government. At their maximum there were more than 1,200 British troops in Sierra Leone, though the British government has already begun to withdraw most of them, and plans to leave only a few hundred, including a contingent to assist in the reorganization and training of the Sierra Leonean army. As of June 5, there were 11,350 UNAMSIL troops in the country, including 254 military observers, made up largely of Nigerians, Kenyans, Zambians, Ghanaians, Guineans, and Indians, under Indian command. On May 17, RUF leader Foday Sankoh was taken into custody, after going into hiding in Freetown for a week. He is currently held by the Sierra Leonean government at an undisclosed location.  Protection of Civilians  The U.N. and its member states have failed to demonstrate the commitment to the implementation of the Lomé peace accord that is implied by the U.N.'s acceptance of the position of """"moral guarantor"""" of the agreement. It took three-and-a-half months for the Security Council to adopt a resolution creating a peacekeeping force, and further months for the soldiers authorized under that resolution actually to arrive in Sierra Leone; only after the recent crisis did UNAMSIL's military contingent reach the level of 11,100 authorized in February. Moreover, the mandate eventually granted to the peacekeeping force is too limited for the conditions facing it, while the troops that have been deployed have failed to implement even that limited mandate.   The current resolution governing UNAMSIL establishes what has been described as a hybrid mandate, authorizing some use of force, but essentially holding to a classical peacekeeping (under Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter) rather than peace-enforcing role (Chapter VII). According to resolution 1289 of February 7, 2000, UNAMSIL is authorized, in addition to responsibilities relating to the facilitation of the free flow of people and humanitarian relief and the provision of security at various locations, """"to take the necessary action to ensure the freedom of movement and security of its personnel and, within its capabilities and areas of deployment, to afford protection to civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, taking into account the responsibilities of the Government of Sierra Leone.""""   UNAMSIL has failed to fulfil even this limited mandate to protect civilians. When UNAMSIL forces have come under RUF attack since the resumption of hostilities in early May, they have frequently chosen to make an immediate retreat rather than attempting to maintain their positions. When abandoning their positions in Lunsar and Hastings in early May, and Kabalah in early June, UNAMSIL troops took no steps to protect the civilian populations of these areas. Human Rights Watch research has established that the RUF have committed serious human rights abuses in areas briefly under RUF control, including rape of women and girls, summary executions, abductions, mutilations, widespread looting, and arson. Such abuses have taken place in Masiaka, Makeni, Lunsar, Port Loko, Yelibuya Peninsula and many smaller villages in the area of recent RUF activity. In light of the RUF's clearly demonstrated abusive record towards civilian populations, UNAMSIL command must take the possibility of RUF abuses against the civilian population into account when abandoning positions to the RUF: recent research demonstrates that civilians are indeed """"under imminent threat of physical violence"""" when RUF takes control of an area.   To make clear the obligation that U.N. soldiers have towards the population of Sierra Leone, Human Rights Watch believes that the mandate of UNAMSIL should be strengthened to require (not only authorize) its forces to take all necessary action to provide security to civilians within the areas of its deployment, and in addition to use its best efforts to expand the zone within which it is able to protect civilians.   But amending the mandate of UNAMSIL is not sufficient. The recent deployment of British troops indicated that what is needed in Sierra Leone is above all a well-equipped, well-trained force under decisive command willing to take a stand to challenge those who abuse human rights. The Security Council should call on other countries with sufficiently trained and equipped troops, under effective command, to make a contribution to the UNAMSIL forces.   In addition to ensuring the protection of civilians against RUF abuses, the U.N. must work with the Sierra Leonean government to put in place disciplinary and other procedures to prevent and punish violations of international humanitarian law and other abuses by pro-government forces, including international troops. This vigilance is especially necessary because many of those now fighting on the side of the government have a history of abuse, especially the members of the AFRC/ex-SLA, but also the CDF militias. Close attention should be paid to abuse of suspected RUF fighters, including summary executions of suspected RUF rebels, by pro-government forces. In this context, Human Rights Watch is disturbed at the emphasis that has been placed on reconstituting the Sierra Leonean army as the first priority of the international community. Given the Sierra Leonean army's history of serious abuses, its reconstitution must be in a accountable form. We question whether this is possible in the short term and under current political conditions.   The role of the civilian human rights unit of UNAMSIL should be strengthened to allow it to play an effective role monitoring the human rights conduct of all forces in Sierra Leone, including the RUF, pro-government forces, and UN forces present in Sierra Leone. To ensure that the civilian human rights unit has a deterrent effect on human rights abuses, the unit should have the necessary mandate and resources to investigate allegations of human rights abuses effectively and to establish responsibility for those abuses by identifying the individuals involved as well as command responsibility. Further, the civilian human rights component of UNAMSIL should have the mandate and capacity to press for accountability for abuses by sharing its findings and conclusions with the relevant disciplinary and judicial authorities, and by monitoring the disciplinary or judicial response of those authorities. The civilian human rights unit of UNAMSIL should make public on a regular and timely basis its findings and recommendations about human rights abuses in Sierra Leone and the response of the parties involved. The work of the civilian human rights unit of UNAMSIL needs to be well integrated into the larger UNAMSIL mission, and its findings and recommendations must be given the necessary weight by the political and military units of UNAMSIL.  Justice The Lomé Amnesty under International Law  Since the civil war began in 1991, warring factions used extreme violence against civilians with impunity. Members of the RUF, including their leader Foday Sankoh, not only escaped justice but were rewarded for a decade of unspeakable atrocities by being brought into government under the Lomé accord and granted a blanket amnesty for crimes committed during the war. Forces on the government side, including some from the former Sierra Leone Army and the AFRC who have fought on both sides at different times, have also escaped any consequences for human rights crimes. Article 9 of the Lomé agreement required the government of Sierra Leone to """"grant absolute and free pardon and reprieve to all combatants and collaborators in respect of anything done by them in pursuit of their objectives.""""   International law, however, does not accept amnesties for the most serious human rights abuses. Indeed, states have a duty to prosecute the perpetrators of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. For the last decade the United Nations, through different organs, has consistently rejected laws granting impunity for serious human rights crimes. The U.N. Security Council and other bodies have also underlined the need to prosecute those responsible for grave breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law.   The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General, present at the negotiations, attached a reservation to the Lomé agreement in line with these statements, which provided that: """"The United Nations interprets that the amnesty and pardon in article nine of this agreement shall not apply to international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law."""" The U.N. Commission on Human Rights noted this reservation and affirmed that: """"all persons who commit or authorize serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law at any time are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to bring those responsible to justice.""""   The Security Council failed to endorse explicitly the Lomé disclaimer or to reject the amnesty laws, although it has taken the position that the amnesty does not extend to post-Lomé abuses. In resolution 1289 of February 7, 2000 the Security Council noted only that """"the amnesty extended under the [Lomé] Peace Agreement does not extend to ... violations committed after the date of its signing."""" Going further, British Minister of State Peter Hain stated in testimony before the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on May 22, 2000, that the amnesty """"cannot apply to any members of the RUF, from Foday Sankoh downward, who have clearly torn up the agreement by reneging on the piece of paper they signed. Therefore, as was made perfectly clear in Lomé, they forfeit the amnesty which they were granted, rightly or wrongly, at that time.""""   The Security Council should reconfirm explicitly that the purported Lomé amnesty does not apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law regardless of when these crimes were committed.  Prosecutions in Sierra Leone  Where fundamental guarantees of justice and fairness can be met, Human Rights Watch believes that it is the primary responsibility of national courts to prosecute human rights crimes. In the case of Sierra Leone, however, the justice system has been so destroyed by a decade of war that we do not believe that trials would be able to meet fundamental guarantees of justice and fairness without substantial international assistance and involvement. Even with international assistance, the Sierra Leonean judiciary may not be capable of offering the fairness and transparency necessary to conduct trials of this sensitivity and complexity. The system is characterized by poorly trained and low-paid judicial staff and lack of resources, as well as the effects of the continuing instability and lack of security in the country. Sierra Leone retains the death penalty, which Human Rights Watch opposes under all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.   Moreover, given the strong sentiments of the Sierra Leonean public against the RUF and its leader Foday Sankoh in particular, it is uncertain whether the Sierra Leone judiciary would be able to withstand the public and political pressure for a speedy conviction of the rebel leader, regardless of evidence and proper procedure. Such a trial could easily be rejected by its detractors as a form of victors' justice. Finally, a trial for Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone would create significant incentives for the RUF to blackmail the Sierra Leone government into freeing or pardoning Sankoh, through the continued use of terror tactics against the population. Moving the trial to a more international setting would significantly increase the credibility of the process, guarantee a fair trial, and would limit the proceedings' potential for disruption.   Nevertheless, in the medium to long term, it is clear that the majority of crimes during the civil war will have to be judged in Sierra Leonean courts. Given the current limitations in personnel, resources and capacities of these courts, the international community should begin preparing the assistance that will be needed for them to function effectively and according to international standards, including preparing programs to assist in the training of new staff.   In order to bolster the capacity of the Sierra Leone judiciary, the international community should also work with the Sierra Leonean authorities to integrate foreign jurists, particularly from Commonwealth countries with similar systems, who could serve as judges, defense lawyers, and prosecutors in these trials. The common law basis of the Sierra Leone legal system and its similarity to many other Commonwealth jurisprudences would allow for the introduction of foreign jurists, defense lawyers, and prosecutors from other commonwealth countries with minimal disruption.  Trials in Other Countries  Under the international law principle of universal jurisdiction, the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes can be prosecuted in any country. The United Nations Convention against Torture, ratified by 118 countries, requires states to prosecute or extradite torturers who enter their territory. Former president of Chile Augusto Pinochet was the first former head of state to be indicted by another country for human rights crimes, Hissein Habré of Chad was the second, and many observers have called for Foday Sankoh to be tried under similar circumstances.   For Sierra Leone, however, the Pinochet precedent would be only a partial response to the need for justice. The responsibility for crimes against humanity and war crimes during Sierra Leone's brutal civil war extends beyond Foday Sankoh, and thus demands that investigations be conducted against those in leadership positions who ordered such crimes on all sides, including the RUF, the AFRC/ex-SLA, and the civilian militias or civil defense forces commonly referred to as Kamajors.  The Need for an International Tribunal   For these reasons, Human Rights Watch believes that best method to achieve justice would be for the Security Council to create an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone (ICTSL) with jurisdiction over all crimes against humanity, war crimes and others serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed at least since March 1991, when the RUF launched its rebellion.   Sierra Leonean NGOs have endorsed the idea of international justice. Noting that """"we are strongly convinced that the impunity enjoyed by the actors in this conflict is responsible for the continuous atrocities being committed,"""" the National Forum for Human Rights called for the establishment of an international war crimes tribunal. Forum of Conscience, a human rights organization, has joined in this call.   Because of the inevitable time required to establish an international criminal tribunal, Human Rights Watch urges the international community, in coordination with UNAMSIL and the Sierra Leone government, to send investigators to Sierra Leone immediately to collect evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both before and after the Lomé accord. Beginning this process of gathering evidence now is essential for maximizing the potential of the prospect of justice to deter further atrocities.   No matter what route to justice is established, the minimum benchmarks attached to this memorandum should be adhered to.  Arms and Diamonds   The United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Sierra Leone in 1997, and modified it in 1998 to apply only to non-governmental forces. The Security Council formally delegated to ECOMOG responsibility to enforce the U.N. arms embargo, but the regional force showed little capacity to halt illegal weapons inflows. When U.N. peacekeeping forces began taking over responsibility for the Sierra Leone mission in December 1999, their mandate did not include enforcement of the international arms embargo against the rebels through border monitoring and other measures, leaving no one with responsibility for this crucial task. The Security Council has also not provided for reported breaches of the embargoes to be properly investigated. The sanctions committee set up to monitor implementation of the 1997 embargo on Sierra Leone is not known to have carried out independent investigations, even though there has been some correspondence in individual cases of reported breaches.   Human Rights Watch has been concerned by persistent reports that RUF rebels have continued to import weapons via neighboring countries despite the embargo. These reports suggest that arms destined to the RUF routinely transit through neighboring Liberia, which is also subject to a mandatory U.N. arms embargo. Charles Taylor's NPFL and later Liberian government has long been accused of providing direct military support to the RUF, including training, personnel and considerable logistical support. The government of Burkina Faso under President Blaise Compaoré has also been implicated in the provision of weapons to the rebel forces. The RUF continues to have in place channels of supply through which it can readily import weapons.   The diamond trade has also been key to the conflict. Drawing its initial support at least in part from anger at the government's mismanagement and theft of diamond resources, the RUF's ability to purchase weapons depends to a large extent on its control of Sierra Leone's diamond-producing areas. This control continues today, and an estimated 85 percent of diamond production in Sierra Leone is believed to be smuggled out of the country, mainly through Liberia. While the Lomé agreement provided that the government shall """"exercise full control of the exploitation of gold, diamonds and other resources for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone,"""" it gave Sankoh the post of chairman of the Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development. U.N. attempts to enter the diamond areas may have been an element in the decision of the RUF to take UNAMSIL soldiers hostage.   Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the Security Council to take firm measures to ensure that the RUF is not able to replenish its military supplies and thus prepare itself for further violence and grave human rights abuses. At a minimum, the Security Council should provide for the rigorous enforcement of the arms embargo imposed on the RUF, including by the deployment as soon as possible of well-equipped U.N. forces to monitor borders (especially with Liberia), roads, and airstrips bordering on rebel-controlled areas and halt any weapons shipments they detect. The Security Council should also seek to halt diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone by imposing a ban on all diamond imports from Sierra Leone, other than those authorized by the Sierra Leonean government through an effective certification regime. In addition, the Security Council should order an ad hoc inquiry into illegal arms flows to the RUF rebels and the role of trade in diamonds in financing weapons purchases. Finally, it should create an arms embargo unit within the U.N. to ensure continual monitoring of the implementation of these sanctions.  Minimum Benchmarks for Sierra Leone Justice   Human Rights Watch believes that justice for Sierra Leone would be best served by an international tribunal. Whether this is the case or a tribunal is established under Sierra Leonean law, we consider the following to be the minimal acceptable principles for a credible and legitimate justice effort. We call on the Sierra Leonean government and the United Nations to commit themselves to these principles. We also call on the United Nations and other international actors to condition funding and international recognition for any trials in Sierra Leone upon acceptance and implementation of these principles. It is essential that the international community avoid giving legitimacy to trials that would not meet minimum international standards.  Legal Basis of the Proceedings. The tribunal or court's jurisdiction, competence, fair trial guarantees, rules of procedure, and evidence should be drawn from international standards including, where appropriate, precedents of the two existing ad hoc international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The Court must enjoy and be seen to enjoy full independence and to operate with impartiality. Organization of the Court. An effective justice effort would require sufficient judicial resources to allow for the timely disposition of trials, and provision for independent appellate review.  Personnel. It is essential for the credibility of the process that the judges, prosecutor, and staff be individuals of high moral character, impartiality, and integrity who possess experience in criminal and international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. Subject Matter Jurisdiction. The court should be given jurisdiction not only over crimes defined in the Sierra Leonean criminal code such as murder, battery, torture, kidnaping, and rape, but also over crimes subject to universal jurisdiction under international law, including crimes against humanity, war crimes and others serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed at least since March 1991, when the RUF launched a rebellion to overthrow the Sierra Leonean government. The definitions of these crimes should be drawn from the statute of the International Criminal Court and the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In the case of an international tribunal, it should have ongoing jurisdiction until the Security Council declares that the conflict no longer poses a threat to international security, as is the case with the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Protection of Witnesses and Personnel. Programs must be established for the protection of witnesses and the security of all other participants, including judges and lawyers as well as investigators and defendants and prisoners. This protection must be available from the earliest investigatory stage through post-trial measures. In particular, the court must be able to take security measures to protect witnesses and victims and their families from reprisals. Such measures must not prejudice the rights of suspects and accused. Fair Trial and Due Process. The court should ensure the highest international standards of fair trial and due process at all stages of the proceedings. Particularly given the collapse and consequent mistrust of official institutions in Sierra Leone, justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done. Therefore, the tribunal must be scrupulous in its respect of international standards including according to Articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Universal Declaration); and Articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Circumstances of Arrest and Conditions of Confinement. No one should be subject to arbitrary arrest and detention in contravention of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration and Article 9 of the ICCPR. All prisoners should be treated humanely in accordance with Article 10 of the ICCPR; the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment; and Articles 7 and 15 of the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Death Penalty. There should be no provision for the death penalty, which is an inherently cruel punishment under all circumstances. Pardons and Amnesties. Amnesties, which essentially erase the criminality of past acts from the record, should be barred. If exceptional circumstances arise in which the granting of an individual pardon is contemplated, the extreme seriousness of the offenses should be taken into account so as not to undermine the decisions of the courts and rob the whole effort of legitimacy. Financing. The international community should provide adequate financial support to ensure the effective and timely functioning of the justice effort. The international community should provide support for the reconstruction and capacity-building of the Sierra Leone justice system, including the training of judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and administrative support staff. Cooperation. The Sierra Leonean government, the United Nations, and its member states must agree to give their complete cooperation with the justice effort and comply with court resolutions and orders, such as opening files, ordering the arrest of suspects, ensuring full cooperation with all aspects of the investigation and the arrest of suspects, and allowing staff to appear before the court. Broad-based and Inclusive Justice. The process established must focus on the criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed by all sides to the conflict in Sierra Leone, and not only on the responsibility of RUF leader Foday Sankoh.","Africa, Sierra Leone",""

George W. Bush to halt the execution of Gary Graham, who was convicted of murder at the age of seventeen. He is slated to be executed on Thursday evening unless Gov. Bush intervenes. Human Rights Watch sent letters this week to Gov. Bush and the Texas parole board requesting a stay to ensure that Graham not be put to death for a crime he committed as an adolescent. The international monitoring group also noted that fundamental questions remain about the evidence in Graham's case and the fairness of his trial. Since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Texas has executed six juvenile offenders, more than any other state. Twenty-six juvenile offenders—a third of the national total—now sit on Texas's death row. This record makes Texas the worldwide leader in putting adolescent offenders to death. Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the only countries other than the United States known to execute juvenile offenders, in defiance of international standards. """"Death is an inhumane punishment, particularly for an adolescent offender,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Adolescents simply don't have an adult's experience, perspective, or judgment."""" Graham's conviction and execution would raise serious concerns even if he were not a juvenile offender. He was convicted on the identification of a lone eyewitness who testified that she saw him for less than a second. In the judgment of some experts, the eyewitness may have been influenced by a suggestive police lineup. Two other eyewitnesses came forward after Sankofa's trial to say that he did not commit the murder for which he was sentenced to death. His defense attorney never challenged the flawed lineup and failed to call a single witness in his defense. That attorney has since been disciplined at least four times by the Texas bar and was once jailed for contempt after he repeatedly mishandled a criminal case. When such issues have not been raised at trial, appeals courts generally cannot consider them. In Graham's case, a federal court noted that he had presented """"significant evidentiary support"""" for his claim of innocence. But no court has ever investigated those claims fully. At a minimum, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles should review this evidence before it rules on Graham's clemency petition. Governor Bush has publicly stated that he would reconsider a jury verdict if the jury never heard critical evidence of innocence.

Bush requesting a stay to ensure that Graham not be put to death for a crime he committed as an adolescent. The international monitoring group also noted that fundamental questions remain about the evidence in Graham's case and the fairness of his trial.  Mr. Sankofa was convicted and sentenced to death at age seventeen. Unless you grant him a stay of execution, he will be put to death on June 22. Consonant with the overwhelming worldwide view that the death penalty should not be imposed for crimes committed by those under the age of eighteen, you should ensure that Mr. Sankofa is not executed for a crime for which he was convicted when he was a juvenile. If the State of Texas carries out his death sentence, it will solidify its status as the worldwide leader in this abhorrent practice and reinforce the United States' position as a violator of this basic principle of international justice. Texas has executed six juvenile offenders since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Including Mr. Sankofa, twenty-six more—over a third of the national total—sit on Texas' death row. This record places the state at the forefront of a select group that includes Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the only countries other than the United States that are known to put juvenile offenders to death. Death is an inhumane punishment, particularly for an adolescent offender. The reality is that children and adolescents are different from adults. They lack an adult's experience, perspective, judgment, maturity, and restraint. In recognition of these fundamental differences between children and adults, article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights forbids the imposition of capital punishment on those who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the crime for which they were convicted. Although the United States purports to reserve the right to impose capital punishment on juvenile offenders, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, charged with interpreting the Covenant, has concluded that the U.S. reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and has asked the United States to withdraw it..Even if Mr. Sankofa had not been a juvenile offender, his execution would raise serious concerns in light of his mistreatment by the Texas criminal justice system. Reviewing Mr. Sankofa's case in 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted that he had presented """"significant evidentiary support"""" for his claim of actual innocence. Although the court dismissed his petition for habeas corpus on the technical ground that he had not exhausted state remedies, it noted, """"There is a large body of relevant evidence that has not been presented to the state court."""" To date, no state court has ever examined this evidence. You should direct the Board to review this evidence as part of its investigation of Mr. Sankofa's case. You should also urge the Board to consider the quality of legal representation Mr. Sankofa received at his trial. Mr. Sankofa was convicted on the testimony of a lone eyewitness. His lead attorney failed to call a single witness in his defense, effectively preventing him from presenting evidence that may have corroborated his claim of innocence. The attorney has since been disciplined at least four times for professional misconduct in other cases; after he repeatedly mishandled one criminal case, a judge jailed him for contempt. Under these circumstances, the fundamental fairness of Mr. Sankofa's trial is called into doubt. Finally, you should ask the Board to consider the striking racial disparities with which the death penalty is applied in Texas and elsewhere in the United States as it evaluates Mr. Sankofa's clemency application. Although whites make up 75 percent of the population of Texas, they represent only 36 percent of those on death row. An African-American defendant convicted of murdering a white victim in Texas is six times more likely to receive a death sentence than a white defendant convicted of murdering a black victim. Such discriminatory impact has the effect of restricting individuals' rights based on race, in violation of article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. You have stated publicly that you would consider reviewing a jury verdict in a case where the jury had not heard critical evidence. In Mr. Sankofa's case, you are offered the opportunity to stay true to your word on this point. We ask that you grant Mr. Sankofa a stay of execution and order the Board to conduct a thorough investigation of his case.

The international rights group found that child farmworkers often work twelve- and fourteen-hour days, and risk pesticide poisoning, heat illness, injuries and life-long disabilities. The vast majority of child farmworkers are Latino. The laws governing minors working in agriculture are much less stringent than those for other sectors of the economy, Human Rights Watch said, allowing children to work at younger ages, for longer hours, and under more hazardous conditions than children in other jobs. """"Farm work is the most dangerous work open to children in this country,"""" said Lois Whitman, Executive Director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"U.S. laws should be changed to protect the health, safety, and education of all children."""" The 1938 federal law governing this type of labor specifically exempts farmworker youth from the minimum age and maximum hour requirements protecting other children. At the state level, eighteen states have no minimum age for farmwork, while in some other states the minimum age is as low as nine or ten. The report, """"Fingers to the Bone: United States Failure to Protect Child Farmworkers,"""" focuses on children aged thirteen to sixteen. Some of these young workers told Human Rights Watch that they work as many as seventy or eighty hours a week. Often, their workdays begin before dawn. Drawing on scores of interviews with child farmworkers and farmworker advocates, """"Fingers to the Bone"""" concludes that: Juvenile farmworkers are routinely exposed to dangerous pesticides, suffering rashes, headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Long-term consequences of pesticide poisoning include cancer, brain damage, and learning and memory problems. Many young farmworkers are forced to work without access to toilet facilities, handwashing facilities, and adequate drinking water, the three most basic sanitation requirements. The lack of handwashing facilities contributes to pesticide poisoning and bacterial infections, while the lack of adequate drinking water can lead to dehydration and heat illness. Children often work in fields where the temperature is well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Children working in agriculture suffer a high rate of injuries from knives and heavy equipment. Child farmworkers account for eight percent of all working minors, but suffer 40 percent of work-related fatalities among children. Long hours of work interfere with the education of children working in the fields. Statistically, only 55 percent of farmworker children in the United States finish high school. Of the dozens interviewed by Human Rights Watch, nearly every one had dropped out of school for at least one extended period of time. Young farmworkers are often cheated from receiving their rightful wages, and many earn far less than minimum wage. Some interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported earnings as little as two dollars an hour. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $5.15. Human Rights Watch called on Congress to amend US labor law to end discrimination against child farm workers. The law at issue is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which specifically exempts farmworker youth from the minimum age and maximum hour requirements protecting other children. In other occupations, the FLSA prohibits the employment of children under fourteen, and limits children under sixteen to three hours of work a day when school is in session. In addition, the FLSA allows sixteen and seventeen-year olds to work under hazardous conditions in agriculture; in all other occupations the minimum age for hazardous work is eighteen. """"A twelve-year-old kid can work unlimited hours on a farm, but isn't allowed to work in a fast-food restaurant,"""" said Lee Tucker, a Human Rights Watch consultant and author of the report. """"There's no good reason to have such a double standard."""" Last year, the United States was one of the first countries to ratify a new treaty on the worst forms of child labor. Congress recently denied trade benefits to developing countries that don't comply with the new treaty. But the United States itself is not in compliance, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch urged the Department of Labor to more vigorously enforce violations of already-existing laws, including minimum wage requirements, and the Environmental Protection Agency to better protect children from pesticide exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration should expand enforcement of field sanitation regulations, Human Rights Watch said, and all states should set or raise the minimum age for agricultural work to at least fourteen.

On June 12, the Thai authorities expelled 116 refugees from Don Yang refugee camp in Kanchanaburi Province to Burma's Mon State.  You can't send people back without proper screening,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"This is a basic principle of international refugee protection. The people who have been forced back should be allowed to return and should be given a proper hearing."""" Earlier this year, the Kanchanaburi provincial admission board, one of several such bodies established throughout the border region by the Thai government to process refugee claims, rejected the applications of 116 refugees seeking to remain in the camp. Many of the refugees had fled fighting between the Karen National Union and the Burmese army in 1997, but had reported to the camp only after border-wide registrations in 1998. Thai authorities used the refugees' delay in reporting to the camps as a basis for denying them the right to remain there, a rationale criticized by Human Rights Watch. The provincial admission board subsequently set a deadline of June 12, 2000, for the group to be returned to Burma. Fearing possible forced return to Burma, many of the refugees moved out of the camp. When a group of Thai army, immigration, border police, and district officers arrived at the camp to deport the refugees, they found only some forty to sixty of the original rejected population. According to reports, officials made up the difference by including other asylum seekers present in the camp who had not passed through the admission process and were not registered. A total of 116 refugees were then forcibly deported to Burma's Mon State where many are presumed to have moved into camps sheltering internally displaced persons. The area is currently subject to a cease-fire between the New Mon State Party and the Burmese government. """"These forced returns set a dangerous precedent for thousands of other asylum seekers whose cases are under review by the provincial admission boards,"""" Saunders said. """"To the extent that lack of resources is the problem, the Thai government should discuss burden-sharing with its neighbors and other members of the international community. Protection of Burmese refugees should be on the agenda of the upcoming July ASEAN ministerial meetings in Bangkok."""" Background The Burmese refugee population registered in camps in Thailand numbers over 120,000. Thailand is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, nor does it have its own domestic refugee law to offer legal guidance. The Thai government, however, has established provincial admission boards to review the cases of new arrivals on a group basis. The boards are currently reviewing the cases of some four to five thousand Burmese. Thai authorities only allow entry to the camps to those deemed to be """"persons fleeing conflict."""" Only those persons fleeing direct fighting are accepted by the boards. These narrow criteria fail to take into account all of the other grave human rights abuses that cause refugees to flee Burma, including forced relocation, arbitrary execution, forced labor, and torture. Human Rights Watch previously has criticized the provincial admission boards for failing to provide effective protection to those in need. It has also called on the Thai government to suspend any further deportations from the camps until an unambiguous set of criteria consistent with international standards is drawn up for use in status determinations.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

One hundred and twenty nations voted in favor. A growing number of governments has denounced U.S. efforts to re-open and weaken the treaty.

S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs","06/13/2000","I am grateful to the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs for affording me this opportunity to appear before you. In addition to my academic work as a specialist in Tibetan Studies, I have also served for some time as a consultant to Human Rights Watch. Most recently, I collaborated with Human Rights Watch on a new book, Tibet Since 1950: Silence, Prison, or Exile (published with Aperture Foundation) graphically detailing the reality of exile from Tibet today and the role that human rights violations play in forcing many Tibetans to leave their homeland. It is as a representative of Human Rights Watch that I address this Subcommittee.   I am here today to speak to Human Rights Watch's concerns about human rights conditions in Tibet. Tibet has been, for more than a decade, a place where some of the most visible and egregious human rights violations committed by the Chinese state have occurred. It is well known that Tibetan nationalism forms the background to this situation. Human Rights Watch does not endorse any particular political arrangement to resolve the issue of Tibet, but we do advocate that the right of all Tibetans to peacefully articulate and express themselves on political questions must be respected under existing and future political arrangements, whatever they may be.   Since 1987, Human Rights Watch has monitored and reported extensively on abuses that have transpired in Tibet. In general, we are pleased to note, greater attention is now being paid by the United States government to the situation in Tibet; for example, human rights violations there are now given significant exposure in the State Department's annual review of international human rights conditions.   Unfortunately, however, gross violations of human rights remain a continuing fixture of the situation in Tibet, in spite of the efforts of various concerned governments--including the U.S.--and NGOs to focus attention on the problem. It is crucial, therefore, that measures for putting effective pressure on China to adhere to recognized international human rights norms be included as a key component of U.S. policy towards China and be built into legislation governing U.S. relations with China.   In my testimony I will briefly describe several areas of continuing human rights violations in Tibet that are of particular concern to Human Rights Watch.   One of our concerns is continuing violations of religious freedom and the implementation by the Chinese government of policies aimed at subordinating religious practices and sentiments to serve the political needs of the state. This is not just a question of propaganda and persuasion. Rather, these policies impinge upon the freedom of many Tibetans to peacefully put into practice or even express certain key aspects of their religious beliefs; and they are implemented through the use of coercion, violent repression, and imprisonment. Particularly prominent in this regard has been the ongoing campaign of """"patriotic education,"""" aimed at undermining and eliminating the Dalai Lama's influence in Tibet. But there has also been an increasingly heavy-handed turn by the Chinese authorities towards putting certain monasteries and temples under secular, government-backed management in order to implement greater government control of Tibetan religion.   Such policies are closely tied to the well-known case of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the child whom the Dalai Lama formally recognized as the incarnation of the Panchen Lama. This child has been subjected to virtual house arrest for the last five years simply because most Tibetans have accepted him as the incarnation of the Panchen Lama and rejected the child whom the Chinese government named as Panchen Lama. Neither he nor his family have freedom of movement.   I will also discuss disturbing evidence that torture of prisoners in Tibet continues, in a number of cases resulting in death in custody. Torture has become entrenched in Tibet as part of the price that political activists must pay.    Finally, I would like to draw upon our new book Tibet Since 1950: Silence, Prison or Exile for a case study which illustrates what the effects of human rights abuses can be in one individual's life.     Making Religion Serve Politics   The issues of the Panchen Lama and """"patriotic education"""" are closely bound up with each other, since it was the Dalai Lama's announcement of the recognition of the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama that precipitated the campaign of """"patriotic education."""" When the Dalai Lama formally recognized the Panchen Lama in May 1995, the Chinese authorities reacted by virulently denouncing him and by taking harsh measures against the child whom he had recognized. The boy and his family have been kept in effective isolation from the outside world, and government representatives and human rights monitors have not been allowed independently to verify their conditions, in spite of many attempts to do so. Those who have tried to visit him in the five years since he was spirited away include Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights; Harold Koh, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor; and, most recently, Raymond Chan, the Canadian Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, who tried to see the child earlier this month. In all cases the requests were rebuffed; China simply states that the child is in good health but will allow no independent verification of that statement. In December 1995, China enthroned its own choice as Panchen Lama.   The Panchen Lama is generally considered to be just below the Dalai Lama in stature within their particular sect of Tibetan Buddhism and as such has great prestige within Tibet. China's actions are designed to exert unquestioned state control over religion, to the point, in this case, of dictating whom Tibetans may revere as a religious hierarch. In other instances the state has assumed a visible presence in certifying certain incarnations and in harshly suppressing those who dissent. In the case of the Karmapa Lama, the head of the Karma Kagyupa sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the restrictions on his movement made it impossible for him to receive proper teachings from his traditional mentor; as a result he had no choice but to flee Tibet. He arrived in India at the beginning of this year.   More recently, the Chinese government alone managed the search for another important incarnation within the Dalai Lama's sect, Reting Rinpoche. By all appearances, this is part of a continuing effort to control such searches in order ultimately to stage manage the discovery and enthronement of the next Dalai Lama.   Human Rights Watch is concerned about the gross infringement of the right to freedom of conscience that this constitutes, all the more so because Chinese authorities have arrested people who have peacefully opposed this process. They include, most notably, Chadrel Rinpoche, a high-ranking lama from the Panchen Lama's monastery of Tashilhunpo: he is imprisoned along with several other Tibetans accused of working with the Dalai Lama from inside Tibet to identify the incarnation of the Panchen Lama. The issue here is not simply a question of polemics and intellectual disagreements, but of methods and tactics involving clear violations of human rights.   As I have noted, the struggle over the recognition of the Panchen Lama led to a campaign of """"patriotic education"""" that has imposed a harsh regimen of political tests on residents of Tibetan monasteries in order to root out any allegiance to the Dalai Lama. Again, this has not been simply a peaceful polemical issue: the campaign resulted in the expulsion of monks and nuns from their cloisters and the imprisonment and torture of some for refusing to accept state control of what they perceive as vital aspects of their religious lives and beliefs.   The application of this campaign has not been uniform. Over the last year, it appears to have been winding down, but this may be because it is thought to have achieved sufficient success in subordinating Tibet's clergy to the political control of the state. On the other hand, recent and unusually harsh Chinese denunciations of the Dalai Lama and his followers may be a prelude to a renewed campaign. In any event, the campaign's effects remain, with many monks and nuns still barred from their cloisters and other, vocal dissidents still in prison.   The campaign, widely implemented, has required clergy to demonstrate their rejection of the Dalai Lama and the child he has recognized as the Panchen Lama, as well as their acceptance of Tibet's status as an inalienable part of China. In the region that Tibetans know as Amdo, covering parts of the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan, monks at Kirti and Rebgong monasteries have clashed sharply with the authorities, with resultant expulsions and arrests. This enforced subordination of religion to politics has brought about noticeable changes in the running of monasteries and nunneries: in some cases, the secular authorities have taken over their management; in others, monastic leaders have simply resigned themselves to accommodating the political directions of the state. In short, it is absolutely clear that unfettered religious practice does not prevail in Tibet's monasteries today.     Torture and Abuse in Prison   In addition to the fact that arrest and imprisonment in Tibet are frequently carried out as a result of peaceful dissident activity--in violation of international human rights law--there are serious abuses following detention. Incidents of severe beatings at the time of arrest, torture during incarceration, and severe beatings of inmates already sentenced have been reported with sufficient frequency and from a number of credible sources as to put the issue beyond doubt and, moreover, to demonstrate that these abuses are not isolated incidents but rather the product of a policy for dealing with political dissidents. Such reports continue to emerge.   Human Rights Watch estimates that there are approximately 600 known political prisoners in Tibet, most of them monks and nuns.    A Tibetan arrested in Lhasa in August 1999 for trying to raise the Tibetan flag in a public square, Tashi Tsering, was brutally beaten before being taken away by Public Security officers. In March 2000, he was reported to have committed suicide in prison a month earlier. In April 2000, a further death in custody was reported, that of Sonam Rinchen, a farmer from a town near Lhasa. He had been arrested with two others in 1992 for unfurling a Tibetan flag during a protest and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Although information is difficult to obtain, a study by the Tibet Information Network suggests the incidence of deaths in detention in Lhasa's Drapchi prison among prisoners due for release in 1998-1999 averaged approximately 1 in 24. Several such deaths were reported as suicides.   In one notable incident in May 1998, political prisoners in Drapchi staged major protests to coincide with a visit from a European Union delegation. The protests were non-violent, but the authorities' reaction was severe: one monk, Lobsang Gelek, died after he was shot. His family was later told that he had committed suicide. The authorities also attributed the deaths of several others prisoners who had demonstrated to suicide, despite credible reports that they had been beaten. Four nuns who had protested all died on the same day in the same way while held in strict solitary confinement. The authorities claimed they had committed suicide, but unofficial reports said they were singled out for particularly harsh treatment as suspected ringleaders of the protests.   At least ten prisoners are believed to have died in the aftermath of the protests. Those subjected to beatings are reported to have included several nuns known to already have had their original sentences extended for continued non-violent protests in prison. Most prominent among them is Ngawang Sangdrol, one of several nuns who smuggled a recording of political protest songs out of prison in 1993, and whose sentence was increased to 18 years.   To date, the Chinese government has been evasive in responding to European Union and NGO questions about the Drapchi protests, but it is clear that the imposition of arbitrary extensions to their sentences is a further abuse affecting Tibetan political prisoners. Only last week in fact, nine Tibetan prisoners in Kandze, an important town in the eastern reaches of the Tibetan Plateau, were reported to have had their five-year prison sentences for participating in a peaceful protest in October 1999, increased to ten-year terms.   The Chinese authorities have also been unresponsive to concerns expressed by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention about the cases of three Tibetans who had their sentences extended for staging a peaceful political protest during the Working Group's visit to Drapchi in October 1997. To date, Chinese authorities have refused to adequately explain their actions. Nor have they explained their failure to release Ngawang Choephel, the well-known Tibetan musicologist who was arrested while doing research in Tibet in 1995, and whose detention the Working Group has formally declared to be in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Human Rights Watch is also concerned about fifty Tibetan students detained late last month when they sought to return home via Nepal after previously leaving Tibet to further their education in India. They, too, may be victims of arbitrary detention. The Chinese government should release them immediately absent evidence that they have engaged in criminal acts. None should be held for peaceful political activity and all should be granted internationally recognized due process protections, including the right to be informed of the charges against them.     The Individual Experience of Human Rights Violations   One account included in the new Human Rights Watch publication, Tibet Since 1950: Silence, Prison, or Exile, tells the story of a young Tibetan student from the eastern reaches of the Tibetan Plateau, outside the boundaries of the Tibet Autonomous Region. (Such areas to the east of the TAR are composed of lower level Tibetan autonomous units. They are distinct from the regions that comprise the TAR but they are very much a part of the Tibetan world, in terms of history, culture, and nationalist identity and activity.) Although this young man's story does not exemplify the brutality of imprisonment experienced by many of those whose cases I have raised, it gives a broader picture of the reality of living under conditions in which respect for basic human rights is not a given. In the account, the student describes his struggle, in his region's minority institute, to have several courses taught in Tibetan rather than Chinese, and to have a Tibetan language publication reinstated to serve as an outlet for the creativity and intellectual activity of the institute's Tibetan students. The publication was reinstated, but was soon subjected to official censorship, which weighed more and more heavily on the student. Finally, when he himself authored a piece which alluded indirectly, but clearly, to the subordinate status of Tibetans, he was confined to the school compound and effectively barred from classes. In one stroke, he saw his future possibilities dashed; not for vocal protests for Tibetan independence, not for denouncing human rights violations, but simply for expressing discontent with the lot of Tibetans in China as he saw it. At that moment, he decided that his only alternative was to leave his family, friends, and the life he had known behind and flee into exile. That flight in itself was not without danger, but he made it over the border into Nepal and then into India. This student's story will serve, I hope, to demonstrate that human rights concerns in Tibet are important beyond the cases of those who engage in the most vocal forms of protest, or whose religious veneration of the Dalai Lama is under attack. Violations of human rights in Tibet resonate broadly into the everyday lives of Tibetans across the board.     Recommendations   Time and again since 1989, the U.S. government has voiced its intention to hold China accountable for its abysmal failings in safeguarding some of the most basic human rights of its citizens. The President and other senior administration officials have raised the issue of human rights violations in Tibet with President Jiang Zemin and other senior Chinese officials during summit meetings and other official gatherings. This is to be welcomed, but it has not resulted in meaningful, positive change. In fact, human rights conditions in China have noticeably deteriorated in the past year or more, something attested to in the State Department's most recent annual report.   On the other hand, China is clearly sensitive to its international image and standing. That is why it has vigorously resisted any debate on its human rights record at the annual meetings of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. And under pressure, it has signed, although not always ratified, a number of important U.N. human rights treaties, including, most recently, the international covenants on civil and political rights, and on economic, social, and cultural rights.   We recommend the following:   1) If Congress chooses to end the annual trade review and grant China PNTR, the existing review process must be replaced by a credible mechanism which can ensure that there is a continuing spotlight on China's human rights record. To this end, Human Rights Watch supports the formation of a standing, bipartisan human rights commission, as proposed by the House of Representatives in the bill it passed last month granting PNTR. We urge the Senate to join in enacting legislation to create such a commission, to include both Congressional and Executive branch members and a permanent staff, and to empower it to monitor human rights conditions in China and Tibet, including the state of religious freedom and worker rights, and to publish an annual report on its findings.   The legislation establishing the commission should provide for some staff to be based in Beijing and Lhasa, as well as in the U.S., in order that effective, on-the-ground monitoring can be undertaken. In addition, the commission's annual report, including its findings and recommendations relating to U.S. policy and action, should be the subject of regular Congressional debate and vote, to take place before a designated date each year, after the report's delivery to the House and Senate. This will help ensure that human rights abuses in Tibet and China remain a key issue on the U.S.-China agenda.   2) The President, when he meets President Jiang Zemin, as at the expected summit meeting this fall during the APEC conference in Brunei, should speak out both publicly and privately, urging China's full compliance not only with its commitments to respect global trading rules but with its commitment to respect its international human rights obligations.   Specific steps the U.S. should recommend to help improve human rights in Tibet include:  Ending the reeducation campaigns in the Tibetan nunneries and monasteries;  Releasing unconditionally all Tibetans imprisoned or detained for their peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression;  Allowing the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child or another international body immediate access to the Panchen Lama recognized by the Dalai Lama;  Permitting the U.N., foreign journalists, diplomats, and independent human rights monitors regular access to Tibet. This would be a positive, constructive confidence-building measure","Asia, China and Tibet","Religious Freedom"

""""Black and white drug offenders get radically different treatment in the American justice system.

The ten states with the greatest racial disparities are: Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Maine, Iowa, Maryland, Ohio, New Jersey, North Carolina, and West Virginia. In these states, black men are sent to prison on drug charges at 27 to 57 times the rate of white men. """"Most drug offenders are white.

""""But blacks comprise the great majority of drug offenders sent to prison. The solution to this racial inequity is not to incarcerate more whites, but to reduce the use of prison for low-level drug offenders and to increase the availability of substance abuse treatment."""" Among the report's key findings: Nationwide, blacks comprise 62 percent of drug offenders admitted to state prison. In seven states, blacks constitute between 80 and 90 percent of all people sent to prison on drug charges. Nationwide, black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at 13 times the rate of white men. Two out of five blacks sent to prison are convicted of drug offenses, compared to one in four whites. Black men are incarcerated at 9.6 times the rate of white men. In eleven states, they are incarcerated at rates that are 12 to 26 times greater than that of white men. Nationwide, one in every 20 black men over the age of 18 is in prison. In five states, between one in 13 and one in 14 black men is in prison. """"Punishment and Prejudice"""" also documents how drug law enforcement has fueled the exploding U.S. prison population. During the 1990s, more than one hundred thousand people were admitted to prison on drug charges every year. Over 1.5 million prison admissions on drug charges have occurred since 1980. The incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders has propelled the nation's soaring incarceration rate, the highest in the western world. Human Rights Watch calls for changes in drug control strategies to minimize their racially disproportionate impact and to reduce the overincarceration of nonviolent offenders. Among its recommendations, Human Rights Watch urges states to: repeal mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug offenders; increase the availability of alternative sanctions; increase the use of drug courts; increase the availability of substance abuse treatment; and eliminate racial profiling","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/06/07/world-class-crimes","World-Class Crimes","World-Class Crimes","","06/07/2000","Last fall, in a town about 60 miles northeast of the capital of Sierra Leone, I stood in a crowd of cheering members of the Revolutionary United Front and watched as their leader, Foday Sankoh, took the podium. Under Sankoh's leadership, the RUF had conducted an exceptionally brutal offensive against government troops and civilians. But a peace accord signed by the government and rebels in July 1999 gave Sankoh and his forces a full amnesty for the crimes they'd committed in the eight-year war. Sankoh was detained last month in Freetown, and the Sierra Leone government now says it intends to prosecute him for illegal diamond trading and for the deaths of 21 demonstrators outside his residence last month. But on that day in October, Sankoh sat placidly on stage (in a pair of lizard-skin shoes) with the military commander of the United Nations in Sierra Leone, and knew that the Nigerian peacekeepers scattered around the room in their camouflage uniforms would not, could not, lay a finger on him. Christian and Muslim prayers were said. A handful of Sierra Leonean reporters sat in the second row, pencils at the ready. Finally Sankoh took the podium, and the crowd went wild.  """"My brothers,"""" he began. He reached out his hands and made a gesture of wiping, stroking each palm over the back of the other hand. """"You have nothing."""" His meaning, to the assembled band of RUF thugs, could not have been clearer: They were getting off scot-free for all the atrocities they had committed. In a country where hands have extraordinary symbolism - where the signature human rights abuse of the rebel force was, in fact, the amputation of hands - Sankoh's gesture was flabbergasting. Behind me I could hear our translator, who had narrowly escaped being murdered by the RUF in its January 1999 offensive against Freetown, gasp and whisper, """"Oh, my God."""" We had spent the morning interviewing the war's latest victims. We visited a tiny village deep in the bush, where the residents no longer slept in their homes because they were so afraid of rebel raids at night. Many of their children had been abducted, and several women had been raped. Then there was the young man we found at a dusty clinic just a couple of miles from where Sankoh was holding his rally. His neck and shoulders and spine were covered with tiny, deep burns inflicted by the rebels after he refused to give them money. """"We're planting rice,"""" the rebel soldier had said as he plucked a plastic bottle from a campfire and methodically dripped searing plastic over the man's naked back. The victim was lucky to be alive.  The U.N. dignitaries on the podium behind Sankoh remained expressionless during the rebel leader's little speech. Perhaps beneath their poker faces, their stomachs were churning with the same indignation and fury that I felt. But the moment stays fixed in my memory because it so neatly encapsulated the indefensible listlessness of the international community in the face of Sankoh's crimes.  The United Nations did not sanction the amnesty included in the 1999 accord. But the peace agreement was reached under U.N. auspices, and the British and the Americans were its chief architects. We at Human Rights Watch, who denounced the amnesty and warned that the peace accord would fail if the RUF were not brought to justice, were considered impractical spoilers. All sides, it was said, were eager for the war to end, on virtually any terms. Rather suddenly, a consensus seems to have developed that Foday Sankoh is a war criminal who should be excluded from power. But now that he's in custody, what should be done with him? Sierra Leone's judicial system, after years of civil war, doesn't have the capacity to prosecute Sankoh. The authorities in Freetown have produced a curiously anemic list of charges against him, probably because some of the military figures currently allied with the government deserve to be prosecuted too.  Some observers have suggested a West African regional court to prosecute Sankoh. Others have proposed a hybrid tribunal with local and international judicial experts. It's essential that any tribunal have the resources and legitimacy to mount a strong prosecution. In the longer run, there's obviously only one solution for Sankoh's ilk: a permanent international criminal court. The good news is that most countries in the world support the treaty setting up such a tribunal, and 97 have already signed it. The bad news is that the United States is still fighting a rearguard action to make the court weaker, out of a fear it might try to prosecute American citizens.  In any case, the international criminal court is still years away, and it won't have retroactive jurisdiction to pursue Foday Sankoh. In the meantime, the United Nations should set up an independent tribunal, like those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, with the power to investigate and prosecute all the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were committed in Sierra Leone. The Security Council's permanent members, especially the United States, Britain and France, will have to throw their support enthusiastically behind such a court for it to have the wherewithal to construct proper prosecutions. A team of researchers and lawyers should be heading for Freetown without delay - the RUF is still committing serious abuses. This will be politically difficult and take some time. Sierra Leone is already fading from the front pages, and the Security Council is far from eager to undertake another tribunal. But the country cannot be stabilized without a full-throttle, international effort to prosecute its tragic crimes. Outsiders have the ability to make a difference - they only need the political will.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice"

The rights group has interviewed women from Makeni, Port Loko, Lunsar, and the Yelibuya Peninsula who gave detailed accounts of rape, including a significant number of cases of gang rape and rape of young children as young as ten. In many cases victims were taken to rebel bases or command centers and raped there, suggesting that this is sanctioned behavior.       """"Our research has uncovered a disturbing number of cases of rape by RUF fighters in the town of Makeni and other areas under their control,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Women in RUF-controlled areas are at constant risk of being abducted and raped. Once again this underlines the need for the protection of civilians to be the first priority of international and government troops in Sierra Leone.""""     In early May, the RUF took more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage and restarted offensive action against the Sierra Leone government. Eyewitnesses and survivors who have fled RUF-controlled areas have provided detailed accounts of widespread looting, rape, abduction, killings and mutilations by RUF forces in recent weeks (See HRW release, Fresh Reports of RUF Terror Tactics ). Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than one dozen women who were themselves raped by RUF fighters since early May.     Late in the night of Monday, May 22, a large group of RUF fighters came to the house of twenty-one-year-old """"Myriam"""" (not her real name) in Makeni. The RUF fighters ordered Myriam and a second woman, """"Asiatu,"""" aged twenty-two, who had given birth just five days before into the living room of the compound. The rebels then ordered """"Fatou,"""" the second wife of Myriam's husband, to hold up a light and illuminate the room.

Madina saw a very young girl whom she knew to be about ten years old brought to the compound and sexually abused: """"There was no chance to talk to her.

Human Rights Watch made its call as governments gathered at the U.N. in New York to review improvements in women's status since the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. """"Five years later, are we better off? Not on the issue of violence against women,"""" said Regan Ralph, Executive Director of the Women's Rights division of Human Rights Watch. """"We'd like to see governments leave New York with a plan to ensure that police, doctors, prosecutors and judges take violence against women seriously."""" Since the 1995 women's conference, Human Rights Watch has conducted research in five countries — Pakistan, Peru, Russia, South Africa, and the United States—that documents how violence against women is fueled by the indifference of state officials and the failure to seriously investigate and prosecute cases of violence.  Official estimates from Russia indicate that 12,000 women die every year as a result of domestic violence. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan concluded that upwards of 80 percent of women in that country are victims of domestic violence. In South Africa, there were 49,280 reported rapes in 1998; the nongovernmental Rape Crisis Center asserts that the actual number of rapes is much higher, given that many incidents go unreported. Peru's National Police received 28,000 reports of domestic abuse in 1998. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control reported that at least 1.8 million women are assaulted every year by the men in their lives. Also in the U.S., a 1999 government report indicated a serious problem of sexual abuse of women in state and federal prisons. The greatest barrier to change is the still-pervasive notion that domestic violence is a man's prerogative and rape is the fault of the victim. This bias exists throughout the system, among police, prosecutors, doctors and judges. """"It's five years after Beijing, and women who report violence to the police are still likely to be blamed for the attack,"""" said Ralph. """"That's just not acceptable."""" In Pakistan, for example, a police chief told Human Rights Watch that almost all women reporting rape had lied to cover up consensual sex. In Peru and South Africa, police overwhelmingly fail to respond to sexual assault as a crime unless the victim is a virgin, the offender is a stranger, or the violation entails the infliction of serious and visible injury. In the United States, incarcerated women who are raped by their guards face disbelief and retaliation when they try to report the assault. And in Russia, women reporting domestic violence are still told to take their problems home, where they belong. Human Rights Watch hailed some changes in laws and official practices that help make the world safer for women. In 1997, the UN General Assembly endorsed specific criminal justice reforms to give equal protection to female victims of violence. Peru created one-stop centers for victims of domestic violence, where women can find police, medical examiners, and prosecutors, all under one roof. In early 2000, Pakistan's government promised to treat so-called honor killings as crimes. Since 1996, the South African police have trained some officers to respond effectively to cases of violence against women and established victim support programs. But such progress will be wasted without stronger commitments from governments to make needed changes.","Global","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Human Rights Watch previously documented the events in Aldi in a February 23 press release, but the new report documents in detail the killings of forty of the victims, along with six cases of rape, and the widespread arson and looting of civilian homes.  """"The Russian government has not undertaken any serious investigation of these horrendous crimes,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"President Clinton should put this at the head of his agenda with President Putin.""""  Russian authorities have themselves admitted that special riot police units (in Russian, OMON) from the city of St. Petersburg and Riazan province were in Aldi on February 5. The military procurator passed the case over to the Grozny civilian procurator, stating that OMON units do not fall under his supervision. Three civilian procurators are currently investigating the killings.  The failure to address what amounts to war crimes in Aldi directly contradicts Putin's statement on May 29 that """"all violations of the law in Chechnya will be stamped out in the most severe fashion regardless of who committed them.""""  Human Rights Watch called on President Clinton to set a deadline for President Putin to start prosecutions against Russian forces for the massacre in Aldi. President Putin should also demonstrate significant and measurable progress towards implementing the April 2000 U.N. Commission on Human Rights resolution on Chechnya. This resolution included a call to the Russian government to """"establish urgently, according to recognized international standards, a national, broad-based and independent commission of inquiry."""" Neither the Duma (parliament) commission headed by Alexander Tkachev, nor the commission of inquiry headed by former minster of justice, Pavel Krashenninikov, meet internationally recognized standards on commissions of inquiry. Russian forces began shelling Aldi in earnest on February 3, using cluster bombs against a civilian objects. Reconnaissance units of Russian conscript soldiers entered the village on February 4, warning the local residents to come out from their cellars and to have their documents ready for inspection the next day. On February 5, 2000, Russian riot police and contract soldiers entered Aldi and went from house to house executing civilians. Some killings were accompanied by demands for money or jewelry, serving as a pretext for execution if the amount was insufficient. Others victims lacked identity papers. Several witnesses stated that the soldiers forcibly removed the victims' gold teeth or stole jewelry from corpses. Despite the great cultural stigma attached to rape in Chechnya's predominantly Muslim communities, second-hand reports of the rape of women by Russian soldiers in Aldi on February 5 have surfaced. Several women spoke to Human Rights Watch researchers about six cases of rape. This suggests that the actual number of incidents could be many more. In one incident, soldiers reportedly gang-raped four women and strangled three of them, leaving the fourth for dead. Russian soldiers torched many homes of Chechen civilians in Aldi. While soldiers engaged in some pillage on February 5, the pillage on a massive scale took place during the following week. Witnesses stated that soldiers returned in large numbers on February 10 and in broad daylight brazenly stripped their homes of valuables. Because the Russian government has shown a clear lack of political will to vigorously investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the Aldi massacre, a national commission of inquiry is likely to be inadequate. Several witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they had withheld information from Russian investigators in Aldi for fear of reprisals.  """"Only an international commission of inquiry could enjoy the trust of eyewitnesses and of victims' relatives,"""" said Cartner. """"Until such an international commission is formed, with the ability to recommend prosecutions, it's not likely that those who are guilty of the Aldi atrocities will ever be punished.""""","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Russia","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch's mission is to protect and advance human rights, and our research and advocacy on corporate responsibility is shaped by these concerns alone. Human Rights Watch takes no position on trade or development policies per se. But in an interconnected world where very large and influential transnational corporations compete for finite resources and new markets, human rights and economic activity are increasingly intertwined. Human Rights Watch believes that increased economic activity without respect for human rights can lead to the marginalization of certain sections in society and if economic or social conditions worsen, the prospect for increased public dissatisfaction with government and hostility towards foreign investors can occur because the government and its business partners are seen as mutually reinforcing actors in a situation that does not benefit society as a whole. This can lead also to further human rights violations because of a general climate of instability that can include abuses in the context of civil unrest or conflict, or because the government chooses to adopt repressive measures to suppress any opposition to its rule, or both. Such situations are not conducive to increased respect for human rights or a stable business environment.   We encourage businesses to contribute to the respect of human rights. Recognizing that they can muster resources and influence far beyond the means of any individual person, and in some cases, beyond that of the state, Human Rights Watch urges corporations to be a force for improving respect for human rights through a broad range of actions in the course of their operations and in the countries where they are located. Such measures include: emphasizing commitment to the rule of law which underlies respect of human rights; developing policies and programs to ensure that human rights are integrated into business operations; and ensuring respect for the human rights, including labor rights, of their employees.   Human Rights Watch works to end a broad range of abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the freedom of association, assembly and religion, violations of due process, and discrimination on racial, gender, ethnic and religious grounds. The standards we use are universal civil and political rights as embodied in international laws and We seek to curb abuses regardless of whether the victims are well-known political activists or those of lesser visibility such as factory workers, peasant farmers, undocumented migrants, women forced into prostitution, street children, or domestic We also address such war-related abuses as indiscriminate shelling or the use of rape or as weapons of war-no matter which side in a conflict is responsible.","Global","Economic Justice and Rights, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/06/01/stopping-violence-against-women-challenge-governments","Stopping Violence Against Women- A Challenge to Governments","Stopping Violence Against Women: A Challenge to Governments","Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","06/01/2000","In 1995, at the United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, 189 governments pledged to fight violence against women in all its forms. With this pledge, they agreed to end practices and policies that engaged in, condoned, or accepted violence against women; to prevent violence and protect women at risk of violence; and to build ways for women to win justice and redress when they are targeted for violence. Five years later, Human Rights Watch challenges governments to live up to their promises by ensuring that they undertake essential reforms. Five years after the Beijing Conference, are women better off? In one key area, combatting violence against women, the answer is a resounding no. Human Rights Watch reporting on six countries—Jordan, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, South Africa, and the United States—shows alarming rates of violence against women, violence that is fueled all too often by the indifference of state officials and the failure to seriously investigate and prosecute cases of violence. These countries provide important examples of how states have failed to meet their human rights obligations when it comes to fighting violence against women. Rather than presenting extreme cases, they instead are representative of the problems that plague female victims of violence in most countries. Grim statistics show just how prevalent violence against women continues to be. Official estimates from Russia indicate that 12,000 women die every year as a result of domestic violence. The nongovernmental Human Rights Commission of Pakistan concluded that upwards of 80 percent of women in that country are victims of domestic violence. In South Africa, there were 49,280 reported rapes in 1998; the nongovernmental Rape Crisis Center asserts that the actual number of rapes is much higher. Peru’s National Police received 28,000 reports of domestic abuse in 1998, of which the victims were overwhelmingly women. Official statistics from Jordan indicate that, each year, one third of the country’s homicides are so-called honor killings, in which women are killed by family members in the name of honor. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control reported that at least 1.8 million women are assaulted every year by their husbands or boyfriends. Also in the U.S., a 1999 government report indicated a serious problem of sexual abuse of women in state and federal prisons. Human Rights Watch has documented how states respond to violence in numerous countries around the world, including Pakistan, Peru, the United States, Russia, South Africa and Jordan. This research shows that, even in very different countries, women confront similar barriers to justice as well as appropriate and humane treatment when they are victims of violence. The following recommendations are based on the research in these and other countries and represent the minimum steps that states should take immediately to end impunity for and tolerance of violence against women.  Repeal and Revise All Laws That Discriminate Against Women and Deny Them Access to Justice   In many parts of the world, women confront laws—or the absence of law—which make it difficult and in some cases dangerous for them to pursue justice when they have been the victims of sexual assault or domestic violence. Some laws define rape as a crime against honor or custom, rather than a crime against the physical integrity of the victim, and thus understate its seriousness. In some cases, the law allows perpetrators to escape punishment if they agree to marry their victim. In other contexts, the law may require a victim to produce excessive corroborating evidence to substantiate her case, with obvious deterrent effect, or courts—including those in Pakistan—may allow irrelevant evidence of women’s previous sexual activity to be admitted to show that she is of """"generally immoral character"""" and undermine the seriousness of her claim. And, across the world, laws exempt rape in marriage from criminal sanction. Many countries have failed to address seriously the issue of violence by police, military guards, and prison staff against women in custody and other forms of detention. In the United States, for example, a number of states have yet to enact legislation criminalizing such sexual misconduct in prisons by guards and other staff. Throughout the world, women have little protection under the law from domestic violence. Few countries explicitly criminalize domestic violence, and even where they do, police and judges often treat it as a non-justiciable, private or family matter or, at best, an issue for civil, rather than criminal, courts. In the case of Peru, although the country was one of the first in Latin America to adopt domestic violence legislation, as of April 2000 this legislation excluded entire categories of women from protection, either because they did not live with their abuser or because they suffered sexual abuse. Where domestic violence is not specifically criminalized, it could be prosecuted under criminal assault laws, yet, in countries like Russia, this seldom happens. If domestic violence is prosecuted at all, it is usually only in cases of murder or grave physical injury, and sometimes not even then. In some countries, such as Jordan, laws also allow for """"honor"""" or """"heat of passion"""" defenses in cases where women are killed by husbands or family members, thus acquiescing in murder of women on grounds of """"legitimate provocation,"""" such as actual or perceived transgression of a woman’s role in that particular society. Examples of such transgressions include a woman refusing participate in an arranged marriage to adultery. Specifically, governments should ensure that:   All forms of violence against women, including marital rape and other forms of domestic violence, are criminalized with appropriately serious penalties.   The criminal justice system is evaluated, while ensuring respect for the rights of defendants, to identify any obstacles to women’s meaningful redress when they are victims of violence.   Laws specifically criminalize sexual abuse and misconduct by prison staff against incarcerated women and provide appropriately serious penalties for these violations.   Laws of procedure and evidence are revised, while ensuring respect for the rights of defendants, to eliminate discriminatory evidentiary burdens and prejudicial and irrelevant attacks on the character of the victim.    Eliminate Police Mistreatment of and Bias Against Female Victims of Violence   When women who have suffered sexual or domestic violence first confront the law enforcement system at police stations they often encounter abusive treatment and rejection of their complaints. Women who have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted frequently find that they are insulted and treated as if they were the guilty party, not the victim. In cases of domestic violence, police in many countries routinely dismiss complaints, either refusing to believe the woman’s allegations or failing to recognize intra-family violence as a crime. Such biased attitudes among police frequently mean that women complainants are turned away and, at times, even intimidated or warned against attempting to file charges. Rather than register and investigate charges of rape, some police officials impugn the veracity of such complaints and accuse women of fabricating charges. Skepticism and scorn about women's complaints of violence are rife: this is a major problem because police function as gatekeepers with respect to women's access to the criminal justice system. Many police demonstrate a simplistic and biased understanding of the dynamics of rape, a lack of knowledge and experience as to the range of circumstances in which rapes of women occur, a lack of sensitivity in dealing with rape victims, and a predisposition to disbelieve victims of rape. Domestic violence is almost universally dismissed as a family issue not of concern to police. Few police acknowledge the seriousness of crimes of intra-family violence against women or their widespread and unchecked incidence. In Peru, for example, Human Rights Watch learned of cases in which police mistreated women filing complaints and even jeopardized their safety by having them deliver police summons to their abusers, who then responded with another violent attack. Rather than register cases, police in some countries pressure women to return to abusive situations. In Pakistan, the police frequently intervene at the behest of the accused, to try to force the concerned parties to reach a settlement without officially registering a complaint. If a victim of sexual assault does succeed in registering a complaint, police follow-up is often minimal and rudimentary. In South Africa, despite attempts to improve police response to reports of rape, unsympathetic officers still neglect rape investigations and have allowed known perpetrators to walk free. Even getting the police to conduct limited investigations often requires persistent inquiries and pressure from the complainant. For example, police may not refer a woman who has been raped for forensic medical examination, thus failing to obtain crucial evidence of the crime. In an illustrative case, Russian police refused for seven months to provide the necessary referral for an exam to a rape victim, despite her repeated requests. Specifically, governments should ensure that:   Police take detailed testimony from all relevant persons whenever a complaint of sexual and/or domestic violence is made.   Relevant state authorities regularly compile and publish statistics on the number of complaints of sexual and/or domestic violence made to police, the actions taken, the number of complaints referred for prosecution, and the final outcome of each complaint.   Independent mechanisms are established to monitor and oversee police treatment of female victims of violence. Police who reject complaints without cause, harass complainants or their families, or otherwise block investigations should be appropriately disciplined.   Police regulations establish clear and explicit guidelines for police intervention in cases of domestic abuse.   Police receive appropriate training in what constitutes crimes of sexual and/or domestic violence; how to take reports of such crimes; how to respond sensitively to complainants who often have been traumatized they their experience; how to investigate such crimes; how to collect and preserve evidence; and the protections available to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses.    Ensure That the Medico-Legal System Provides Women with Appropriate Diagnosis and Treatment   The collection and analysis of medico-legal evidence is of crucial importance in securing convictions in cases of sexual assault and domestic violence. Meticulous documentation of physical and psychological harm can be decisive in building a criminal case against a perpetrator of violence. But in order for the system to work properly, forensic doctors must be trained to conduct a thorough examination, ask the right questions, handle the physical evidence in an appropriate manner, and testify as to their findings. Unfortunately, in many countries the system frequently breaks down, leaving women who have been the victims of violence without the evidence they need to win protection from their assailants and justice from the courts. In many cases, women must overcome tremendous obstacles to even obtain a forensic examination. Police often delay informing women of the necessity of a medico-legal examination or fail to provide them with official referrals required for this purpose. Such lapses on the part of police are especially egregious in view of the transient nature of forensic medical evidence. A timely examination of an accused can yield significant evidence in both rape or other sexual violence or domestic violence cases. Such evidence is lost if it is not recorded within a short period of time after the attack. Forensic doctors also are sometimes biased against women victims of rape or sexual assault, especially unmarried women who were not virgins at the time of the assault. In many countries, doctors focus on the virginity status of the woman and on whether and when the hymen was broken rather than on collecting evidence to demonstrate the extent and severity of women's injuries and to identify offenders. Modern medical standards hold that the use of the condition of the hymen to indicate recent sexual intercourse, or even virginity status, is medically groundless and inaccurate. Nonetheless, in Pakistan and other countries, forensic doctors also routinely perform the so-called finger test. Now a totally discredited means of checking virginity, the test consists of seeing how many fingers can be simultaneously inserted into the vagina. The focus on the hymen also militates against effective examinations of sexually active married women because their injuries are not usually related to hymenal tearing. Even when they do not focus solely on the virginity status of the woman, forensic examinations are often incomplete, as doctors too often only seek the bare minimum of evidence and information. Nor do they as a matter of course administer treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and emergency contraception if required, nor provide information on follow-up treatment and tests for pregnancy and HIV/AIDS. Because they do not consider domestic violence a genuine """"crime,"""" forensic doctors frequently minimize victims’ injuries. For example, advocates in Peru told Human Rights Watch that forensic doctors frequently treat injuries in domestic violence cases as less serious than they would were the injuries sustained under other circumstances, thus thwarting women’s access to redress. Women in detention confront special problems when they need to obtain forensic examinations. For a prisoner who has been assaulted by a prison official, being examined and treated at the prison itself may only add to the trauma. Women incarcerated in the United States have also reported that prison medical staff have physically and sexually abused them during medical exams. Moreover, the employee responsible for the abuse may be in a position to block or delay the woman’s access to the infirmary, or may try to influence the way medical staff there report the incident. Human Rights Watch has documented cases in U.S. state prisons in which prison medical staff refused to examine or treat incarcerated women reporting rape. Specifically, governments should ensure that:   Women who report sexual and/or domestic violence have unobstructed and timely access to forensic medical exams.   All those charged with conducting forensic exams of female victims of domestic and/or sexual violence (including state and private forensic doctors, hospital emergency room medical staff, and emergency clinic staff) are trained in the appropriate and sensitive methods of collecting and handling evidence in cases of sexual and domestic violence.   Forensic doctors receive training in the terminology, significance and courtroom use of medico-legal evidence.   Victims of domestic and sexual assault are treated with fairness, compassion and respect and are able to make informed choices about medical treatment, evidence collection, and counseling.   Women in detention alleging rape or other sexual violence are examined at rape treatment centers staffed by professionals who are trained to handle sexual assault cases.    Provide Protection from Violence Governments have clear obligations under international human rights law to protect women from violence. This includes both seeking to prevent violence and to protect women once they become victims from further violence. At Beijing, governments agreed that their obligations include offering women at risk of violence options such as refuge, counseling, rehabilitation and support services. In the past five years, however, relatively few governments have implemented such measures. In some cases, officials’ actions have directly exposed women to violence. In some prison systems, women who report sexual abuse by prison staff can turn only to ineffective grievance or investigatory procedures, and cannot escape their abusers. On the contrary, they may be required to confront their abuser or continue to live under his supervision. Women who report sexual abuse under these circumstances run the risk of retaliation by their attacker or his allies, including physical abuse, verbal threats and harassment, the suspension of privileges, or longer terms of incarceration. Some governments fail to undertake the minimum measures necessary to offer women protection from violence, for example, failing to provide shelter to women seeking refuge from violence, either alone or with their children. Officials in Jordan and other countries even place women at risk of family violence in prison, ostensibly as a form of protective custody, yet in reality effectively punishing the victim. Often, where shelters do exist, they are located only in major urban centers, leaving rural women without refuge. Some countries offer civil protection orders as a means to protect women from known abusers, but others do not. Yet, even where civil remedies for violence are provided in the form of legally enforceable protection orders, court officials often fail to invoke their authority for this purpose, in favor of less certain and reliable informal assurances on the part of the abuser. Specifically, governments should:   Establish quality shelters or other safe spaces for battered women that function not as de facto detention facilities but as refuges where women can find safety and shelter without compromising their personal autonomy and freedom of movement.   Support telephone hotlines for women victims of violence. These hotlines should be widely publicized and operated by trained staff who can offer basic counseling and refer women to specialized service providers and to shelters. Hotlines for women in detention should be secure and confidential.   Provide a civil remedy for domestic violence victims in the form of a legally enforceable protection order (or interdict) that is easily accessible and readily available. Such orders should direct the batterer to refrain from contacting, approaching, harassing or assaulting the complainant. Such remedies should be available to all women, including those who have never married or lived with their abusive partners.   Regularly collect and publish data on gender-based violence, including the type of violence, its pervasiveness, severity, where such violence occurs, the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, and whether the violence was reported to any government authorities. The information should then be used to devise and implement education and prevention strategies.   Undertake public education campaigns on preventing violence against women.    Ensure That Perpetrators are Brought to Justice Because police are often hostile or unsympathetic to women who have been battered by their partners or sexually assaulted, and are frequently ignorant of the legal remedies open to women, many perpetrators are not arrested, or charges against them are dropped without investigation. In those cases that do go to trial, bias on the part of the prosecutor or a failure to secure key medical evidence of the assault means that often perpetrators escape justice. Prosecutors often are unable to successfully build a case against a perpetrator of violence against women because of shoddy police work in cases of sexual assault or a lack of police concern in cases of domestic abuse. Further, public prosecutors too often lack adequate training to effectively evaluate and use physical and medical evidence at trial. As a result, too often, prosecutors will take on only those cases where they feel certain of success, and will reject cases which they consider insufficiently serious because the victim was not a virgin or did not sustain permanent injuries or opt for a lesser charge, thus enabling rapists, for example, to escape the appropriate penalty for their crime. In Russia, prosecutors in two large cities admitted that their offices closed or failed to pursue approximately 50 percent of sexual violence cases filed with police. Nor have victims of domestic violence in countries like Peru been able to count on state prosecutors to pursue their cases; instead, prosecutors seek to resolve domestic assault cases though mediated settlements. Specifically, governments should ensure that:   All prosecutors are required to undertake training to eliminate gender bias in their approach to cases of sexual and/or domestic violence.   Prosecutors should receive special training in the terminology, significance and courtroom use of medico-legal evidence.    Eliminate Judicial Bias Against Women   Women who have been able to register a case of rape or domestic violence face additional hurdles from the criminal justice system. In many countries, trial procedures reflect societal biases against the successful prosecution of such cases. Too often, prejudiced judges doom a case from the outset and help ensure impunity for the perpetrators. Many judges view victims of violence skeptically and tend to hold them responsible for bringing violence upon themselves. Thus, at the trial stage, judges frequently consider the behavior of the woman as a factor when weighing the evidence and, if there is a conviction, in determining the defendant's punishment. On the basis of a presumption of female consent and a belief that women tend to lie in rape cases, judges may also ascribe undue significance to bodily evidence of the use of physical force by the defendant and physical, as opposed to verbal, resistance by the woman. In an example from Pakistan, the presiding judge dismissed a woman’s allegations of rape because he determined that she had not struggled enough; this judge further denounced women for agreeing to sex and then bringing spurious cases to court. Like others in the criminal justice system, judges seldom receive adequate training on the significance of medical legal evidence and do not know how to interpret it at trial. Thus crucial information that could convict the defendant may be disregarded or even used against the complainant. In one South African case, for example, a judge argued that the lack of evidence of penetration in a case involving a forty-two-year-old woman who had three children indicated that a rape had not occurred. Despite such cases, magistrates at the Johannesburg court have resisted such training out of fear that it would prejudice them against defendants Victims of domestic violence often fare even worse in court. Many judges treat domestic violence as a husband's right, and put the onus on the wife to either leave the marriage or accept the abuse. The man is deemed to have no responsibility to stop beating his wife and is instead granted legal sanction for behavior that would otherwise be punishable by a prison sentence. In a Russian case, a domestic violence victim in court for a custody hearing was subjected to a harangue by a judge on the importance of staying with her husband, despite ten years of physical abuse. Specifically, governments should ensure that:   All judges are required to undertake training to eliminate gender bias in their approach to cases of sexual and/or domestic violence.   Judges should receive special training in the terminology, significance and courtroom use of medico-legal evidence.","Global","Women's Rights"

On April 12, 2000 Israel's highest court ruled that the administrative detention of Lebanese nationals as """"bargaining chips"""" -- hostages -- was illegal under Israeli domestic law, making Israel's continued detention of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid (held since 1989) and Mustafa al-Dirani (held since 1994) as hostages a violation of Israeli domestic law as well. On June 11, 2000, in a transparent attempt to legitimize an illegal situation, the Israeli Cabinet unanimously approved draft legislation entitled """"Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to Prisoner-of-War Status Law, 5760-2000"""". The legislation passed its first reading in Israel's Knesset on June 21, 2000. The draft legislation not only fails to end `Obeid and al-Dirani's illegal detention, it opens the way to sweeping human rights violations against them and others by appearing to legitimize prolonged, arbitrary detention. Article 1 of the draft law declares the law to be consistent with the Geneva Conventions (1), while Article 2 gives the Commander of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Force powers to detain indefinitely, without charge or trial, """"a person who belongs to a force fighting against Israel or a person taking part, directly or indirectly, in hostile activities of the said force,"""" but who is not a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention. However, under international humanitarian law, all detainees who are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war are nevertheless protected under the Fourth Geneva Convention(Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War)(2). Those protections include the prohibition of hostage-taking (Article 34), the prohibition against individual or mass forcible transfer (Article 49), and the requirement that internment (detention without charge or trial) """"may be ordered only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary"""" (Articles 42 and 78). Hostage-taking is unacceptable under any interpretation of international humanitarian law, and like the prohibition of torture, is never subject to derogation. Human Rights Watch views with alarm Prime Minister Barak statements that the draft legislation is """"aimed at ensuring that we can detain people from organizations fighting us for as long as our people are held by those groups,' and more specifically, is intended to continue Israel's illegal detention of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani. This intention is borne out in Article 13(A) of the legislation, which includes """"transitional provisions"""" that extend its application to """"a combatant who is not a prisoner of war who is held by state authorities on the date of its commencement."""" Similarly disturbing is the sweeping language of the draft legislation, which may permit the indefinite internment of persons who pose no threat to state security, a violation of both international humanitarian law and international human rights law (3). For example, Articles 2 and 3(A) allow imprisonment based on the IDF Chief of Staff's assertion that an individual """"belongs to a force combating Israel or [is] a person taking part, directly or indirectly, in hostile activities of the said force."""" Judicial review is limited to determining whether a detainee """"is a combatant who is not a prisoner of war."""" (Article 4) The legislation fails to provide the Minister of Defense with guidelines for determining that a particular force is hostile, is engaged in hostile activities, that hostile activities have not ended, or even that it is a force. This raises serious concerns that the legislation could be used to detain individuals based on their political beliefs, and not for any actual acts they have committed. The draft law provides no mechanism for reviewing or challenging such decisions, as the Minister of Defense's determination """"shall serve as decisive proof in this matter."""" (Article 9) Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani are protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and subject to the protections of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Their kidnaping from Lebanon and prolonged incommunicado detention, including periods of prolonged solitary confinement, violate both the ICCPR's prohibition of arbitrary detention (4) and the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition of hostage-taking and forcible transfer(5). Hostage-taking, unlawful transfer, and unlawful confinement are also grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that is to say, war crimes. Human Rights Watch calls on the Israeli government to immediately release Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani, and to publicly commit not to use any other individuals as hostages. Israel has a legal obligation to ensure that no one in its custody is deprived of rights guaranteed them under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Legislation like the """"Imprisonment of Combatants no Entitled to Prisoner of War Status Law"""" are concessions to political expediency that undermine both the rule of law in Israel and the integrity of international law, and should not be allowed to stand. 1. Article 1. The objective of this law is to incorporate in Israeli law the imprisonment of combatants who are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status, in a manner consistent with the provisions of international humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. 2. The Fourth Convention provides protections to persons """"who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals"""" and who are not protected by any of the other three Geneva Conventions (Article 4). 3. Article 9 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary detention. Indefinite detention is by its nature arbitrary. Israel's derogation from its Article 9 obligations is limited to only those measures that """"are of an exceptional and temporary nature"""" (Human Rights Committee General Comment 5) and do not """"depart from the requirement of effective judicial review of detention."""" (Human Rights Committee, CCPR/C/79/Add.93 para. 21) Articles 42, 78, and 79 of the Fourth Geneva Convention allow the internment of protected persons only if imperative reasons of security make it necessary. 4. Ibid., Article 9. 5. Articles 34 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits hostage-taking and individual or mass forcible transfer, respectively. Both violations are also a grave breaches, or war crimes, under Article 147 of the convention. Under Article 146, all state parties to the convention have a legal obligation to """"enact effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed"""" grave breaches, and to investigate and prosecute those persons.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","Detention Centers, International Justice"

The Serbian authorities and the media under their control, however, have repeatedly accused Otpor of """"terrorism."""" Most recently, two key activists were accused of involvement in the murder of a prominent politician in the town of Novi Sad, in a case which many independent observers believe is politically motivated.  Otpor is a loosely structured group that opposes the current government. It numbers an estimated 20,000 activists, most of whom are university students. Since the end of the NATO war (March-June 1999), it has carried out a series of symbolic street actions aimed at ridiculing the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The movement has rapidly acquired sympathy among large sections of the population.  Since the beginning of 2000, the Serbian police have arrested and interrogated hundreds of Otpor activists without specifying the reasons for the arrests. In each case, those arrested were held only for a few hours before being released because there was no evidence that they had committed an offense. The frequent arrests have only increased the group's visibility, including in the traditional government strongholds, such as Pozarevac, the native town of President Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic, located eighty kilometers southeast of Belgrade.

The rights group has documented abductions of children as recently as early May.      """"The RUF has forced many children to join its ranks in recent weeks, placing them on the front lines of combat,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"For child soldiers, the crisis in Sierra Leone is far from over."""" He called on all parties to the conflict in Sierra Leone to immediately stop the use of child soldiers and to release all abducted children and people under the age of eighteen.     Since taking United Nations peacekeepers hostage in early May, the RUF has forced many children, included demobilized RUF child soldiers who had laid down their arms, to join its ranks. Many other children have been abducted by the RUF in recent weeks to carry military equipment and looted goods, and female abductees are regularly raped. The RUF has a long history of using child soldiers.     Seventeen-year-old """"Abubakar"""" (not his real name) told Human Rights Watch that he had gone to a camp for demobilized RUF child soldiers in Makeni in March 2000 after fighting as a child soldier in the RUF for four years. He described how the RUF regularly came to the demobilization camp to pressure children to return to the RUF, telling the children that they would be sold when they left the camp, or stating that the RUF had located their families and would help them reunite. On at least one occasion, RUF fighters came to the camp and told the children that the RUF would kill everyone in the camp if they did not rejoin the rebel army. Abubakar estimated that the RUF took at least fifty children out of the camp through the use of threats, false promises, and false rumors.     When fighting broke out in early May, Abubakar was forced to rejoin the RUF when he was abducted while walking near the demobilization camp in Makeni. """"It was not my wish to go fight, it was because they captured me and forced me,"""" he told Human Rights Watch, """"There was no use in arguing with them, because in the RUF if you argue with any commander they will kill you."""" Abubakar took part in recent fighting in Lunsar, Rogberi Junction, and Waterloo. He and others were often forced to commit abuses. In Rogberi Junction, their commander ordered them to burn down the entire town after a counterattack on the RUF by government helicopters. RUF commanders also used looted U.N. vehicles to move looted civilian properties back to RUF bases. Abubakar finally managed to sneak away from the RUF and return to the demobilization camp, which was evacuated to Freetown soon after. On their way to Freetown, the large group of demobilized child combatants was harassed by the pro-government Kamajor militia as well as by the Sierra Leone Army (SLA), who beat them. Abubakar said the Kamajors got angry with the children for showing them demobilization documents, saying that the children were provoking them because it was known that Kamajors were not educated and could not read.     Fifteen-year-old """"Foday"""" (not his real name) was abducted by RUF when he was eight years old and had gone to the Makeni demobilization camp after the Lomé peace accord. He told Human Rights Watch further details of the evacuation of the Makeni demobilized child soldier camp on May 23. He also said that RUF commanders regularly came to the camp to threaten and scare former child combatants into rejoining the RUF, and explained that the camp was evacuated early in the morning of May 23 because of fear that the RUF would attempt a mass abduction. On their way to Freetown, the eighty-six former child soldiers who left the camp were stopped by RUF and stripped of their possessions: Foday lost a new watch, his clothes, a radio, and some money. The RUF then forced Foday to join them to carry looted goods back to an RUF camp located twenty-seven miles away. He later managed to escape from the RUF, but was then harassed and beaten by Kamajors, who took away his remaining possessions and threatened to kill him until a commander intervened and stopped the abuse.     RUF forces have also abducted children to carry loads of looted goods and military equipment for them, and have abducted girls for the purpose of rape. Fifteen-year-old """"Musa"""" (not his real name) was abducted from Port Loko during an RUF attack in mid-May, and forced to carry a heavy bag of salt for four days. He told Human Rights Watch that the rebels shot and killed his brother, twenty-year-old Lamina K., after Lamina complained that his load was too heavy. Musa showed Human Rights Watch a large bump on his head which he had sustained when he was beat by the RUF with rifle butts.     Rape of captured women and girls is routine. Twenty-year-old """"Miriam"""" (not her real name), still nursing her five-month-old baby, was raped in front of her husband almost as soon as they were captured near Masiaka on May 21. She told Human Rights Watch that she was raped almost continuously by seven RUF fighters, including some as young as fourteen, over the next three days. Some of the girls raped after capture are very young. """"Malikah,"""" who told Human Rights Watch that she was ten but looked much younger, told Human Rights Watch that she was raped by an RUF rebel after being captured, and watched her twenty- year-old sister Mawa Kamara die after RUF rebels amputated both her hands and one foot.     """"Children face some of the gravest abuses in this war at the hands of the RUF,"""" said Takirambudde.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/05/31/elections-peru-democracy-risk","Elections in Peru- Democracy at Risk","Elections in Peru: Democracy at Risk","Meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States ","05/31/2000","(Washington, DC) - Today the OAS is facing a big test of its commitment to act collectively to protect and promote democratic values and human rights. Peru has just concluded a presidential election with a single candidate, which was plagued by irregularities. In the words of the OAS electoral mission, the election was """"far from free and fair,"""" and does not represent the """"authentic popular will"""" of the Peruvian people. The foreign ministers meeting at the OAS General Assembly on June 5 to discuss the Peruvian situation should condemn the irregularities in the April 9 and May 28 elections in the strongest possible terms. They should agree on concrete steps to ensure that free and fair presidential and congressional elections are held in Peru as soon as possible under the supervision of the OAS.     The """"Santiago Commitment to Democracy and the Renewal of the Inter-American System"""" - General Assembly Resolution 1080 - provides a mechanism whereby OAS members states may collectively adopt measures to promote the restoration of democracy when it is under attack. Following President Fujimori's """"self-coup"""" in April 1992, the OAS used Resolution 1080 to press Mr. Fujimori to arrange elections the following year for a constituent assembly and a new Congress. Democratic institutions, however, were stunted by persistent government interference. Today, democracy in Peru is once more at risk. Mr. Fujimori's long maneuver to secure a third term of office, termed unconconstitutional both by Peru's Constitutional Court and by its Ombudsman, has finally been crowned with success by this year's manifestly irregular election. Rather than accept this for a fact, the OAS should invoke Resolution 1080 once more to help Peruvians return their country to a democratic path.    The Peruvian elections: an affront to the Inter-American system     Before concluding that the Peruvian elections could not be salvaged and withdrawing his observers, the head of the OAS electoral observation mission, Mr. Eduardo Stein, made every effort to persuade the Peruvian authorities to delay the vote. Many governments warned President Fujimori of the consequences of proceeding with the elections on May 28 without the approval of the OAS or the participation of the opposition candidate. He chose to disregard all of these warnings. On May 28 President Fujimori was re-elected by default for a third presidential term, in a vote that has alarmed democrats throughout the continent. The President of the European Union, and the governments of the U.S.A., Canada, Chile, Japan, Spain, France, Germany, and Belgium, among others, have made statements deploring the election.     President Fujimori invited the OAS mission to Peru presumably in the belief that its presence would help to endorse the electoral process. However, the mission was unusual in covering the pre-electoral conditions and reporting its critical findings periodically throughout the process. The mission observed and commented on conditions such as candidates' access to the mass media, media coverage of the candidates, the use of government funds and the deployment of government personnel in electioneering activities, and the investigation of irregularities committed by supporters of the re-election campaign. The mission found serious irregularities and inequities in each of these areas, as well as gross inadequacies in the vote-counting machinery and the training of election officials.     Despite persistent recommendations by Mr. Stein's team to the government and electoral authorities, they introduced only limited and superficial improvements. These were not enough to restore confidence and give credibility to the election results. Other international observers, such as the National Democratic Institute, the Carter Center, and the European Union, which also withdrew their observers before the May 28 vote, shared the OAS's conclusion that the reforms were insufficient. National election monitors such as the Peruvian Ombudsman, and the non-governmental organizations Transparencia and the Council for Peace declined to observe for the same reasons. In other words, rarely have the irregularities of a presidential election been better documented, or more clear-cut.     While a president without democratic legitimacy is to govern Peru, severe irregularities also marred the election of its Congress on April 9. They included the still-unexplained registration of more than a million votes in excess of the number of voters, an inexplicable correction to the tally of opposition votes that led to the loss of a seat held by a prominent human rights critic of the government, and the alleged alteration by official computer operators of results in the computation of the preferential vote. After almost two months, the final result of the congressional election has still to be announced, although on May 10 the OAS electoral observation team urged the National Electoral Jury (JNE) to publish it immediately.     Mr. Fujimori has publicly blamed his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, for withdrawing from the presidential race because (Mr. Fujimori alleges) he feared losing in a legitimate vote. He accuses him of sidestepping defeat by sabotaging the legitimacy of the elections (which Mr. Fujimori insists were constitutional and fair). This attempt to shift the blame onto the victims of the election debacle is unfair. The criticisms of the electoral process made by the OAS electoral observation mission and the other observers were independent of, and prior to, the withdrawal of Mr. Toledo, and in part motivated it. Furthermore, Mr. Toledo stated that he would participate if the OAS approved the electoral conditions as fair, which it did not.    Why the OAS must act     By proceeding with the May 28 election regardless, President Fujimori has thrown the ball into the court of world opinion, and, in particular, that of the OAS. A shrewd strategist, he knows that Peru's record on various continental concerns (such as economic policy, the elimination of terrorism, and the war on drug-trafficking) will work to his government's advantage and may counsel a cautious and diplomatic response from regional leaders.     In the past, the Peruvian government has successfully deflected international criticism for questioned actions, such as the dismissal in 1997 of three members of its Constitutional Court who opposed Mr. Fujimori's unconstitutional plans for re-election, or Peru's unilateral withdrawal from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 1999. Statements made recently by President Fujimori and his ministers show that they believe that international criticism can be deflected once again without serious consequences for their government.     If the OAS is to act consistently with its commitment to protect democracy and human rights, it must prove Mr. Fujimori's calculations wrong. The only sure way of preventing rulers from giving in to temptations to break democratic rules is firm action by peer nations. The pro-active method of observation and public comment used by Mr. Stein's team was crucial in revealing the extent of the unfairness of the electoral conditions. Yet, what purpose was served by this scrupulous observation if member states fail to back it up with action?     The defense of democratic values is an essential part of the OAS Charter. The natural reluctance of leaders to interfere in the affairs of their neighbors is not a good defense for inaction. Failure to respond actively to interruptions of the democratic process can only breed a sense of impunity which contradicts the spirit of the Charter, and facilitates authoritarian abuses in the future. The American Convention on Human Rights in its art.23 guarantees that: Every citizen shall enjoy the following rights and opportunities:   a. to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;   b. to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters;     Democrats should take little comfort from Mr. Fujimori's recent promises to create a more democratic climate in Peru after the elections. They seem intended to deflect the debate away from the legitimacy of his new-won mandate. During his current term of office Mr. Fujimori has severely curtailed the independence of the judiciary and the press. Political instability was no excuse for the interference of the executive branch, since during these years the threat of political violence receded notably. By contrast, the unconstitutional interference of Mr. Fujimori's intelligence apparatus, the National Intelligence Service (SIN) in the political process has steadily increased. President Fujimori's record shows clearly that, whatever his other merits, he has shown little respect for democratic values.  Resolution 1080 is not intended only for military coups   In its preamble, Resolution 1080 exhorts member states of the OAS to put into effect the principle enshrined in the Charter that """"the solidarity of the American states and the high aims which it pursues require the political organization of those states to be based on effective exercise of representative democracy."""" Specifically, Resolution 1080 calls for action in response to:     """"any occurrences giving rise to the sudden or irregular interruption of the democratic political institutional process or of the legitimate exercise of power by the democratically elected government in any of the Organization's member states.""""   A fraudulent election aimed at perpetuating the mandate of a sitting head of state, in our view, is tantamount to """"a sudden or irregular interruption of the democratic political institutional process."""" Resolution 1080 is more than an exhortation for the solidarity of member states to pre-empt or respond to military coups. An equally serious, and more insidious, threat to democracy in the region is presented by elected governments that use legal subterfuge to perpetuate themselves in power behind a democratic facade.    Action-not words     The May 31 Permanent Council's rejection of the United States and Costa Rica's proposal for a special meeting to discuss Peru under Resolution 1080 show the caution and reticence of member states when collective action is proposed against a fellow-member. Human Rights Watch urges the OAS Assembly General to show that the organization's defense of democratic values is not just a profession of faith, but a question of mutual commitment binding on all member states. The OAS should decide collectively on specific measures to persuade President Fujimori to stand down at the end of his term on July 28, and to hold fresh presidential and parliamentary elections under OAS supervision as early as possible.","Americas, Peru",""

Many, like Taoufik Ben Brik of Tunisia, Mamadali Makhmudov of Uzbekistan, and Nadire Mater of Turkey, were jailed for writings that offended the government. Some have been forced into exile; Jonah Anguka (Kenya), Kadhi-Joni Mahdi (Iraq), and Alejandra Matus (Chile), have received asylum in the United States. Others are victims of bloody conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Hellman/Hammett grants are given annually by Human Rights Watch to writers around the world who have been targets of political persecution. The grant program began in 1989 when the estates of American authors Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett asked Human Rights Watch to design a program for writers in financial need as a result of expressing their views. This year's grants totaled $170,000. In many countries, governments use military and presidential decrees, criminal libel, and colonial-era sedition laws to silence critics. Writers and journalists are often threatened, harassed, assaulted, or thrown into jail merely for providing information from nongovernmental sources. As a result, in addition to those who are directly targeted, many others are forced to practice self-censorship.","United States",""

It called on the government delegates to commit to upholding human rights as an important way to achieve lasting democracy. """"Democracy is more than elections,"""" said Roth. """"Democracy also means the protection of minorities, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and the accountability of public officials.

Open Letter to the Participants in the """"Community of Democracies"""" Conference   Warsaw, Poland,   June 26-27, 2000   June 23, 2000   Excellencies,   Human Rights Watch welcomes the creation of the """"Community of Democracies."""" We hope that this new club of states will be a force for strengthening and defending democracy. As you gather in Warsaw to explore how to promote democratic institutions and encourage democratic transitions, we urge you to commit to upholding human rights as an essential part of democracy. We also urge you to make your club an exclusive one, one which admits only states meeting the genuine tests of democracy.   We are therefore gratified to see that the list of participants no longer contains Peru, where President Alberto Fujimori was re-elected by default, and Kyrgyzstan, where the February-March parliamentary election was fraught with irregularities. Absent from your list are also other countries where the democratic system has collapsed and severe human rights violations have erupted, such as Malaysia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. We congratulate you on this selectivity and urge you to press these governments to restore their democracies.   At the same time, we are disturbed to see that the list of participants made public in Warsaw on June 16 included several governments that do not have even the thinnest claims to being democracies. The hosts of this meeting surely remember the elections in which the Polish Communist Party regularly gained nearly 100 percent of the vote. Unfortunately, several invitees rival that record. To justify their inclusion by referring to their supposed democratic aspirations is to mock the values that should underlie a conference of democracies.   In Tunisia, President Ben Ali won the October 1999 election by no less than 99.42 percent of the vote. Voices critical of government policies are actively suppressed. The Tunisian media provide no independent perspective on important   political issues, and Tunisian journalists who dare to publish abroad about the government's atrocious human rights record are harassed and even subject to physical attack. Human rights defenders face the same repression, and many have been persecuted for their efforts to raise fundamental rights issues inside or outside the country. Their trials have demonstrated the utter lack of independence of the Tunisian judiciary.   In Yemen, where power is concentrated in the executive, Ali Abdullah Saleh won 96.3 percent of the vote in the country's first nation-wide direct presidential election in September 1999. His opponent was a member of his own party.   In Egypt, where the right to establish political parties remains severely circumscribed, parliamentary elections have been characterized by massive fraud, intimidation and harassment of opposition candidates, and severe restrictions on freedom of assembly. In September 1999 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a fourth 6-year term in a national referendum. According to official results he received 94 percent of the vote. Known or suspected adherents of nonviolent but unauthorized groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood continue to face legal harassment and arbitrary arrest. The government recently renewed for six additional years the emergency rule decree that has been in effect since 1981.   In Burkina Faso, President Blaise Compoare won re-election in November 1998 with 88 percent of the vote. The government's response to the overwhelming public demand for an end to impunity for abuses, particularly in several notorious political killings, was insufficient.   Azerbaijan has held four nation-wide elections since the 1993 coup that brought President Heydar Aliyev to power, and not one of them has met international standards.   Qatar is a monarchy with no constitution or political parties. The Amir holds absolute power.   In Kenya, President Daniel Arap Moi, who enjoys almost absolute power, has won elections through political repression, media control, and dubious electoral procedures. Laws that directly limit freedom of association and political organization continue to remain on the books. The government continues to stall on promises of constitutional reform that would bring greater democratization.   In Kuwait, women may not vote or stand for office. Nor may citizens naturalized for less than 30 years.   Elections, of course, are only one test of a democracy. In addition, a democracy must at a minimum contain safeguards concerning the rights of minorities and other vulnerable sectors. The rule of law, including an independent judiciary, is also an indispensable element of democracy. The rule of law means foremost that state officials are accountable, and that police, the military and other security forces abide by the law, protect the human rights of the country's citizens and are punished for abuses. Some conference participants fail this test. For example:   In Russia, government troops have recently committed atrocities against civilians in Chechnya. Yet the Russian government has not undertaken any serious investigation of these crimes.   Evidence collected by Human Rights Watch has linked half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level army units to paramilitary groups that are notorious for their abuses against civilians. While the government has taken some steps toward purging the military of suspected abusers, cases involving high-ranking officers continue to be sent to military tribunals, where impunity is the rule.   Democracy must be constantly protected and replenished. For democracy to flourish, specific safeguards need to be put in place. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, just two months ago, called on governments to promote and consolidate democracy through the promotion, protection and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.   We urge the governments participating in the Democracy Summit to make an explicit commitment to upholding these basic human rights. We also urge you to encourage governments not in your group to take steps that would make it possible for them to join in, and to exclude those governments that do not yet merit inclusion in the group. We hope that in the future the """"Community of Democracies"""" will be a broad and yet a very exclusive club.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Azerbaijan, Poland, Egypt, Qatar, Tunisia, Yemen, US Foreign Policy",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/05/31/moluccan-islands-communal-violence-indonesia","Moluccan Islands- Communal Violence In Indonesia","Moluccan Islands: Communal Violence In Indonesia","Human Rights Watch Recommendations","05/31/2000","Clashes between members of Muslim and Christian communities in the Moluccan island region of Indonesia have led to more than 200 deaths since June 21. Official government sources, which in the past have often underestimated casualty figures, report that nearly 3,000 people have been killed since communal conflict first broke out in the region in January 1999. Over a half million people have been displaced by the conflict and humanitarian aid agencies report that the most recent outbreak of violence has displaced tens of thousands more.   The communal conflict, which began in January 1999 with economic and ethnic as well as religious undertones, quickly polarized into Christian-Muslim conflict. Although there have been occasional lulls in the violence and and weak attempts at mediation by the central government, the clashes have always resumed and the situation has steadily deteriorated. Unarmed civilians have often been the targets as increasingly well-armed Christian and Muslim partisan mobs launch indiscriminate attacks on villages identified with the opposing side. Observers report that the level of anger and vengefulness among members of Christian and Muslim communities in the region is tremendously high at present and the situation remains highly volatile.   The situation has been exacerbated over the past two months by the arrival of an estimated 2,000 members of Laskar Jihad (Jihad Militia), most of whom reportedly came from Java. Eyewitnesses report that members of Laskar Jihad have participated in a number of recent clashes. There have also been widespread rumors and unconfirmed reports of unidentified provocateurs instigating violence. Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid has alleged that still powerful supporters of former President Soeharto are behind the continued conflict but has yet to produce evidence to support his claims.   In response to the renewed bloodshed, President Wahid declared a civil emergency on June 26, giving him and civilian authorities in the affected provinces many of the powers that military leaders would have under martial law. The President has issued a decree prohibiting outsiders from entering the region. Security authorities have imposed a night curfew, banned gatherings of more than ten people, and ordered all residents to surrender weapons by June 30. On June 26, a Balinese Hindu, Col. I Made Yasa, was named military commander for the region in apparent hopes that the appointment of someone neither Christian nor Muslim would help diffuse tensions.   Declaration of a civil emergency alone is unlikely to do much to diffuse tensions in the region. Distrust of security forces is widespread, in large part because some members of military and police units have broken ranks and taken sides in the conflict. There have long been reports that army and police weapons and ammunition have found their way into the hands of partisans, but reports of direct participation in the violence by members of the armed forces are now increasingly common, with Christian soldiers supporting Christian groups and Muslim soldiers supporting the Muslim side. In attacks in Ambon this week, eyewitnesses reported that a military-issue armored vehicle (""""panser"""") was used in Muslim attacks on Christian communities. Sources in the region report that some soldiers from the East Java-based Brawijaya Military Command have supported the Muslim side, and that some riot police units (Mobile Brigade or Brimob units) have supported the Christian side. The governor of Maluku province, Saleh Latuconsina, has accused a retired general, Brig. Gen. (ret.) Rustam Kastor, of whipping up Muslim sentiment and provoking violence. Partisans on both sides have successfully raided police and military arms depots and are now better armed and more dangerous.   In the meantime, the situation has grown worse for civilians displaced by the violence or in need of emergency assistance. Although international relief agencies are already involved, some of the leading agencies have had to suspend operations in the face of the recent violence and many of the hardest hit areas are without assistance. Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) reports that local medical facilities are under great strain and are running out of essential supplies like drugs and blood bags.    Human Rights Watch recommendations:  Humanitarian aid corridors should be the first priority.   Human Rights Watch endorses MSF's call for Indonesian authorities to open humanitarian aid corridors so that assistance can reach people displaced by the fighting and others in need of relief. The prohibition on outsiders entering the region should not apply to the staff of agencies delivering humanitarian aid. Internally displaced persons should be protected.   The Indonesian government should guarantee the physical safety and basic rights of internally displaced persons, as set forth in the """"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement"""" issued by the office of the U.N.'s Special Representative on IDPs.   Cleanse army and police ranks of disloyal troops.   Members of the security forces suspected of directly or indirectly taking sides in the conflict should be immediately suspended from duty and removed from conflict areas pending full investigation and, where appropriate, prosecution.   Troops/special police units should be regularly rotated out of the region so that members of the security forces do not develop sympathies with local partisans. Army officials have said that they would relieve some 1,200 soldiers who have been in the conflict zone for nearly a year. All troops should be regularly rotated out.   The performance of new territorial military commander, Col. I Made Yasa, should be evaluated according to specific criteria that include how quickly the armed forces are able to facilitate the flow of relief to victims, disarm militias, discipline soldiers who side with combatants, and locate and apprehend suspected provocateurs.   Foreign governments currently providing assistance to the Indonesian military should suspend all such assistance -- including aid, equipment, and training -- until there is no longer a risk that such assistance is contributing to human rights violations and exacerbating the communal violence in the Moluccan island region.   Find and prosecute any provocateurs.   Provocateurs and members of Laskar Jihad found to have engaged in violent acts should be expelled from the conflict areas and be tried for their crimes. Members of Laskar Jihad, most of whom entered the region from Java over the past two months, have been directly implicated by eyewitnesses in several recent attacks and have interfered with delivery of humanitarian aid. President Wahid and others alleging that provocateurs are playing an important role in fueling the conflict havea an obligation to make public the nature of their evidence and make every effort to ensure that those individuals are found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.   Leaders of militias involved in attacks must be identified and brought to justice. Indonesian justice officials should consider appointing a special prosecutor to conduct investigations and prosecute perpetrators on both sides of the Moluccan conflict. In areas where basic order has been restored, ringleaders of the communal violence should be tried for their crimes. At present, no one is being held accountable for the violence and there has been an unending cycle of vigilante attack, revenge attack by the opposing group, revenge counterattack, and so on. Leaders of vigilante groups feel their acts of terror are justified because of previous acts by the other side. They should instead be identified, apprehended, and prosecuted.   Basic free expression rights should be protected.   It is particularly important that the press continue to have unhindered access to conflict areas so that abuses by militias and wayward security units can be brought to light. Civilian communications should not be restricted unless there is clear evidence that the communications are being used to whip up hatred and violence is imminent; if restrictions are imposed authorities must use the least restrictive means available and lift the restrictions as soon as violence is no longer imminent. To counter the prevalence of one-sided, partisan accounts of the conflict, the Indonesian government should make clear in all public pronouncements that both Christian and Muslims continue to be perpetrators of abuses and that both continue to suffer terrible losses.   Donors and friends of Indonesia should increase their support for relief efforts. The recent deterioration of conditions has meant more injuries, fewer doctors and fewer medicines to go around, more displaced people, more people without food and water. Donors should increase support for relief efforts accordingly.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Human Rights Watch believes that this is a positive first step in establishing transparency and accountability within the government of Angola. This backgrounder explains several of the provisions within the oil monitoring agreement, their relevance to human rights, and provides detailed recommendations to ensure maximum transparency and accountability in the agreement in order to foster a climate that can lead to greater respect for human rights. Angola's economic situation is precarious and the country is wracked by civil war between the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The United Nations estimates that about one million people or 10 percent of the population have become internally displaced as a result of the ongoing civil war. All parties to the conflict-- fuelled largely by and the control and sale of diamonds by UNITA and oil by the government--committed human rights violations.(1) Overall, oil revenues comprise 92 percent of Angola's exports, between 70 and 90 percent of government revenues from 1994-1999, and over 50 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).(2) The development of energy resources is often seen as an important way to generate much-needed revenues for a government in order to raise living standards and build a prosperous, stable society. However, in many countries--particularly energy exporting countries--the revenues generated for the government may not lead to better standards of living, increased democratic participation in government, or a better climate for human rights. Instead, economic, social, and political conditions may stagnate or even deteriorate. Stagnant or diminished development in countries that enjoy ample oil revenues is frequently associated with poor governance and reflects a government's inability or unwillingness to adequately manage energy revenues in order to use its increased wealth as a means to foster constructive economic, political, and social development.  A key indicator of the quality of governance is whether a government is committed to transparency, accountability, the rule of law, and human rights. When governments are undemocratic or otherwise unaccountable to their citizens, poor management, poor economic decision-making, corruption, and human rights abuses thrive. Instead of improving the overall situation, an increase in revenue--such as those created by energy development--can serve to reinforce bad practices of an already abusive government by strengthening it financially and by providing the wherewithal to entrench and enrich itself without any corresponding accountability for continued abusive behavior or poor management. Research at the World Bank supports the linkage between increased respect for civil and political rights and better economic performance.(3) Conversely, control over resources and revenues without accountability can lead to the marginalization of certain sections in society and if economic or social conditions deteriorate, the prospect for increased public dissatisfaction with government and hostility towards foreign investors exists because the government and its business partners are seen as mutually reinforcing actors in a situation that does not benefit society as a whole. This can also lead to further human rights violations because of a general climate of instability that can include abuses in the context of civil unrest or conflict, or because the government chooses to adopt repressive measures to suppress any opposition to its rule, or because rebels seek to control resources and territory. It can also have a negative impact on economic performance as well. For example, World Bank research found """"an indication that countries in which all modes of expressing discontent are repressed experience worse performance on investment projects than countries in which public expression of social tensions is tolerated."""" (4) Although the government made commitments to improve human rights, these conditions are present in Angola. Of particular concern, particularly in the context of good governance and establishing greater government transparency and accountability, is the limitation on press freedom in Angola. The press has been tightly controlled by law and by government and opposition intimidation. Angola's press laws allow for no private television stations or short-wave radio stations and also prohibit direct rebroadcasting of other broadcasts. During the Lusaka peace process there was a limited opening up of the media, particularly in Luanda. With the return to war in December 1998, however, these meaningful gains were once again threatened by censorship and intimidation. Attacks against the rights to freedom of expression and association have undermined the defense of other rights and efforts by journalists to hold government accountable have led to government retaliation. For example, Gustavo Costa, who writes for the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, was informed in April 1999 by the presidency that charges of defamation and slander were to be brought against him for writing about corruption within the cabinet. The Luanda Tribunal sentenced Costa on December 24, 2000 to a suspended sentence, a fine of $508 and $20,000 as compensation for """"defaming the Chief of the Civil Office of the President, Jose Leitao."""" Costa made two court appearances on December 12 and 13 in a trial closed to the public and the media. Costa has complained that during the daylong sessions he was subject to pressure from the jury to reveal his sources. Costa's lawyer lodged an appeal against the judgment with the Supreme Court that has yet to be heard. (5) Background to the Agreement: Weapons Procurement and Oil-backed Loans A key area where a lack of transparency and a subsequent lack of accountability was a factor was the procurement of weapons after the resumption of all-out war after the collapse of the Lusaka peace accords between the government of Angola and UNITA in December 1998. Human Rights Watch repeatedly called for the international community to implement a complete arms embargo on the government of Angola and UNITA and to disclose all details of weapons purchases and military transfers following the signing of the Lusaka Peace Accords in 1994. These measures were not adopted and the only arms embargo in place was the 1993 embargo against UNITA. However, the embargo was weakly enforced and at the end of 1998, the renewed conflict, human rights abuses, and violations of laws of war were fueled by new flows of arms into the country. UNITA purchased large amounts of weaponry from foreign sources, """"sanctions-busting"""" through neighboring countries, especially South Africa, Congo, Zambia, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), and also Togo and Burkina Faso.  Meanwhile, there were also arms shipments to the government throughout the Lusaka process. This was not illegal, but undermined the spirit of the Lusaka Protocol and contributed to undermining confidence in the peace process. The weapons were purchased from a range of countries including, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Israel, Ukraine and South Africa. Russia, one of the three governments serving as official observers/mediators in the peace process (the """"Troika""""), undermined its official position by selling large amounts of weapons to the government, resulting in a number of shipments to Angola. Portugal, also a Troika member, entered into military agreements during the peace process. The government's procurement of weapons reached record levels again in 1999, matching the high levels of purchasing in 1994; Russia again featured as the prime source of arms to Angola. (6) During this period, there were concerns that oil revenues were used to finance covert arms purchases. With the decline of international oil prices in 1998, the government was short of cash and used approximately U.S.$870 million of funds generated from signature bonus payments on oil exploration and offshore deepwater concession blocks thirty-one, thirty-two, and thirty-three to pay for its weapons purchases. According to the Angolan foreign minister, these funds are earmarked for the """"war effort.""""(7) The multinational oil companies BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobil, and Elf play a dominant role in these blocks, principally because only large oil majors have the technical expertise and investment capital to develop these technically challenging and expensive deepwater concessions. (8) A round of bidding is currently underway for offshore deepwater concession block thirty-four, which industry sources state is attracting record sums of cash down payments from the multinational oil companies.(9) Because the government budget is not unified or transparent on payments for arms there were also substantial discrepancies between government estimates of defense spending and independent estimates. In some cases, these payments bypassed the ministry of Finance and Central Bank and were made directly through the state-owned oil company Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola (Sonangol), or through the Presidency. The government estimated it was going to spend more than $302 million of its U.S.$2.6 billion budget on defense in 1997. (10) However, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated that 1997 defense spending was $400 million--an almost 33 percent discrepancy with the government's estimate.(11) Similarly, the official government figures suggested that defense spending amounted to 11.1 percent of the 1997-98 budget.(12) However, the IMF estimated that 36.3 percent of the 1997-98 budget was spent on defense and noted that only about half of this expenditure (18.1 percent) was actually recorded by the government.(13) During the Lusaka peace process (1994-1998), no country submitted details of their weapons transfers to Angola to the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons.  As early as 1997, BP Amoco recognized that the company's involvement in the country could be problematic """"if the government fails to live up to commitments made to increase democracy, accountability, and transparency and if oil revenues continue to be the main source of income to the government.""""(14)  In order to address this issue, BP Amoco's chairman Peter Sutherland stated that, """"We have no means of ensuring that these [signature bonus payments] are not used to help finance the government's war effort… What we will do is insist as far as we can that such payments are transparent. Governments can be challenged by their electorates and public opinion generally to justify where the money has been spent.""""(15) However, Human Rights Watch believes that the lack of transparency in the use of oil revenues effectively undermined the ability for the Angolan public to hold government accountable. As former World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz noted,  [M]eaningful participation in democratic processes requires informed participants. Secrecy reduces the information available to the citizenry, hobbling their ability to participate meaningfully… We often speak of government being accountable to the people. But if effective democratic oversight is to be achieved then the voters have to be informed…(16) Compounding these problems was the government's use of future oil production as collateral for loans because of the government's dire financial condition, arrears on debt service payments, and its lack of foreign exchange reserves. These oil-backed loans were obtained in a manner that was not transparent. For example, in early 1998, the Angolan government reached a deal with the Swiss oil trader Glencore to mortgage virtually the last barrel of the government's own oil production in exchange for up-front payments of some U.S.$900 million. The deal was routed through Sonangol and the Presidency rather than the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank. Its terms guaranteed Glencore some 75,000 barrels per day of the government's allocation. The remainder was tied up in pre-financing deals with Britain's Lloyds Bank, BP-Amoco, Chevron, and Elf-Aquitaine.(17)  The constraints on freedom of the press, combined with these large oil deals conducted with virtually no transparency or accountability, have made a volatile situation in Angola worse. Angola, and many of its trading partners, failed to make public details of weapons transfers and other military assistance that would shed light on Angola's actual defense expenditures. The hiding of significant defense expenditures from the budget and arranging oil-backed loans that bypassed normal channels raised serious concerns for the IMF since these unusual financing arrangements did not meet the basic standards of transparency and accountability required by the IMF in order to qualify for assistance. (18) Such public accounting is particularly necessary in the case of arms purchases to governments that have committed human rights violations and when the possibility of future misuse of weaponry is high. One particular situation where the risk of misuse pertains is the procurement and use of indiscriminate weaponry such as antipersonnel landmines. Although the Angolan government signed the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997, it has since been responsible for systematically laying new mines and minefields. Human Rights Watch was an eyewitness to this in 1998 and 1999 and received numerous reports in 2000 of renewed landmine warfare in central and northern Angola and across international borders in Namibia and Zambia.(19) The Oil Revenue Monitoring Agreement In response to the lack of transparency and accountability in the use of oil revenues, the IMF and the World Bank negotiated an agreement that was finalized on April 3, 2000 to monitor oil revenues as part of a larger agreement known as the Staff Monitoring Program (SMP) that set ambitious financial, fiscal policy, and program targets that the government must achieve by December 2000 in order to qualify for lending by the IMF.(20)  Human Rights Watch considers the oil monitoring agreement to be a positive first step by the government and the international financial institutions in order to instill transparency, accountability, and good governance, and ultimately to encourage greater respect on the part of the government for free expression and civil liberties. Nevertheless, there are weaknesses in the agreement that are detailed below. The scope and scale of the monitoring agreement (the terms of reference) are not publicly available since the government of Angola has not released this information and has not authorized the World Bank and IMF to release it. Human Rights Watch considers this to be a significant omission by the government, especially since the monitoring agreement is supposed to lead to greater transparency and accountability and encourages the government to release the terms of reference for the oil monitoring agreement. In order to conduct the monitoring program, the IMF, World Bank, and government of Angola have agreed to hire a major accounting firm to monitor oil revenues and their effort will be supervised by the World Bank. But the program is not retroactive and will not examine past allegations of the secret use of oil revenues. Instead it will monitor revenues from July-December 2000. Once the monitoring program is completed, the government is expected to assume this responsibility. However, there is no guarantee that the government will be willing or able to continue monitoring once the IMF and World Bank program ends. Past efforts by the international financial institutions to monitor oil revenues in other countries have been unsuccessful because of the inability or unwillingness of governments to provide adequate information. The oil monitoring agreement is intended to determine how much oil revenue is deposited into the central bank. Although it is colloquially referred to as an oil revenue """"audit,"""" the agreement is not an audit in the traditional sense. Instead it is an agreement to compare revenues generated for the government from oil exports (domestic oil sales are not part of this program) through its various production sharing agreements and joint ventures (including signature bonus payments) with the amount of funds deposited in the Central Bank derived from these activities. The quality of the monitoring program is completely dependent on how much information the government and the companies, which may have independent data on oil revenues, choose to disclose. Without the cooperation and disclosure of the companies and the government, the monitoring agreement will not succeed. Documents and data from oil companies operating in Angola will be essential for the monitors to assess and compare the flow of oil revenues to the Central Bank. Human Rights Watch urges all of the oil companies to cooperate fully with the monitors and provide the necessary information required to conduct an effective monitoring program. Companies should also urge the government of Angola to cooperate fully with the monitoring program and to publicly disclose the terms of reference and the results of the program. The appointed accounting firm will calculate the amount of government revenue that should be generated by oil exports and then examine whether this amount of funds was deposited in the Central Bank. The effort will help to determine whether any discrepancies between the expected amounts of revenue and the actual amounts of revenue deposited in the Central Bank exist. In some cases, discrepancies may be due to fluctuations in oil prices, changes in the price of oil because of varying degrees of quality, or lesser (or greater) production than initially recorded. However, there may be unexplained discrepancies as well, such as off-the-books arms purchases or loan repayments that are funneled through Sonangol or the Presidency. Human Rights Watch urges the monitors to detail publicly the nature of discrepancies if they emerge. The monitoring program does not have the capacity to trace or audit any discrepancies if they emerge nor will it examine how funds were used after they were deposited in the Central Bank since the government did not agree to these terms. The only way to determine what happened to funds will be to ask the government to report its use of funds. The quality of this information is completely dependent on how much the government decides to disclose and it is possible that the government could refuse to disclose any information. Human Rights Watch strongly urges the government to cooperate fully with the monitoring program and to consider a follow-up agreement with the World Bank and IMF to conduct an investigation and audit when unexplained discrepancies are found. In particular, Human Rights Watch believes that any future oil monitoring agreements should ensure that oil remittances are not used to purchase indiscriminate weapons, such as antipersonnel landmines. The government has not yet authorized the public release of reports and information related to the findings of the monitoring agreement. At this writing, all information will only be available to the government, the World Bank, the IMF, and the monitoring firm. Human Rights Watch believes that an agreement designed to foster accountability and transparency should be publicly available and urges the government to authorize release of this information at the time that the reports on revenue flows are published. Conclusions As the war conditions recede, Angola could be taking the opportunity to move forward from an environment of war, bad governance, economic breakdown and human rights abuses towards an environment of transparency, accountability, rule of law, good governance, and sustained social development--all conditions which auger well for human rights improvements. In this context, the oil revenue monitoring agreement is a positive and necessary step forward in order to establish transparency and accountability within the government of Angola. While a number of institutions have a role to play--the oil companies, the IMF, and the World Bank--the principal responsibility lies with the government of Angola to disclose information to the monitors and to the public as a whole. But without full cooperation by the government and companies and certain further steps, such as a follow-up audit to determine discrepancies, this agreement is not a solution in itself. A key element that can only be supplied by the government itself is a commitment to create strong institutions that promote and protect transparency, accountability, respect for the rule of law, and human rights. 1.

An estimated 27,000 out of a pre-war population of 30,000 non-Serbs were expelled from Bijeljina during the war. Only a limited number have returned to the town, in part because their houses are occupied by Bosnian Serbs and Serb refugees from elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. In certain cases, the police, some of whom are themselves occupying Bosniak houses, have actively discouraged returnees by """"warning"""" them that their safety could not be guaranteed, and """"advising"""" them not to return. In the report, """"Unfinished Business: Return of Displaced Persons and Other Human Rights Issues in Bijeljina,"""" Human Rights Watch documents how the Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia and Hercegovina, has not succeeded in restoring a multi-ethnic society. Instead, the authorities in Bijeljina continue to obstruct the implementation of the Dayton agreement, providing neither protection nor equal rights to the Bosniak community of Bijeljina, while actively deterring the return of Bosniaks who were driven from the city during the war. For a considerable time after the war ended, government institutions, including the courts and the commission dealing with housing issues, refused to accept requests for the return of Bosniak homes or, having received such requests, took no action on them. In those few cases in which a court or the commission restored Bosniaks' rights to reside in their own homes, the decisions were not implemented. """"It was devastating for those who were expelled from their homes during the war in Bosnia,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But it is truly unbearable that more than four and a half years after the war ended, they are still unable to go home."""" Bijeljina is a strategic city in Republika Srpska (RS), in the divided Bosnia and Hercegovina. It was the first city in Bosnia to come under attack by Serbian and Bosnian Serb forces and fall victim to the policy of """"ethnic cleansing."""" On the night of April 1, 1992, paramilitaries belonging to Arkan's Serbian Volunteer Guard, a.k.a. the """"Tigers,"""" together with other paramilitary forces, attacked and occupied Bijeljina. In the four days that followed, many Bosniaks and other minorities lost their lives. Their property was ransacked, looted, and burned, and many Bosniaks decided to leave Bijeljina. During the war, the Bosnian Serb authorities tried to force the non-Serb population to leave through a rigorous campaign of """"ethnic cleansing."""" Many non-Serbs were fired from their jobs, forced to work at the frontline or held in the Batkovi detention camp. Others were forced to accommodate Bosnian Serb displaced persons in their homes. Those who did not leave Bijeljina """"voluntarily"""" were often forcibly evicted from their homes by armed forces and deported. Ultimately, less than 10 percent of the original non-Serb population managed to stay in Bijeljina. Since 1999, there have been some improvements in the situation of minorities in Bijeljina. A new property law that facilitates the return of refugees and displaced persons was adopted. Moreover, the international community increased its presence in Bijeljina and improved the cooperation among the international agencies working there. As a result, the speed of return has slowly increased. Nevertheless, ethnic minorities continue to face many difficulties: in addition the numerous obstacles to repossessing their property, the police force still does not offer equal protection to the non-Serb population; discrimination against minorities manifests itself in several fields; and political representatives of minorities are still not allowed to play their role in democratic government. And significantly, what progress has been made has required sustained and intense pressure from the international community.

There are currently thousands of Rohingya in eastern Bangladesh.  Burma must improve the treatment of the Rohingya, who are abused and treated like aliens in their own country,"""" said Gary Risser, refugee researcher for Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"That's why refugees keep coming to Bangladesh, and thousands of them are afraid to go back.""""  In a new 29-page report, """"Burmese Refugees in Bangladesh: Still No Durable Solution,"""" Human Rights Watch describes the key obstacles to the satisfactory resolution of the Rohingya refugee problem. Any resolution must comply with international human rights standards, including those guaranteeing protection of the rights of refugees.  In 1991 and 1992, some 250,000 Rohingya sought refuge in Bangladesh, and though most of these returned under a repatriation program arranged by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 22,000 remain in camps. More than 100,000 additional Rohingya who have entered the country since 1991 now live in precarious circumstances in Bangladesh outside the camps with no formal documentation as refugees. Though conditions in the camps have reportedly improved, refugees living there continue to suffer abuses, including beatings and other forms of physical abuse, and in the past have been coerced by camp administrators trying to force their return to Burma.  The report updates the situation of the Rohingya in northern Arakan and illustrates how they continue to face discrimination, forced labor, and arbitrary confiscation of their property by the Burmese government. The government also refuses to consider recognizing the Rohingya's claim to Burmese citizenship. Lack of citizenship restricts the freedom of the Rohingya to travel outside and within the country, to partake in public service, or pursue some types of higher education.  Many of the 100,000 or more undocumented Rohingya in Bangladesh may well have a well-founded fear of persecution in Burma and should be provided protection as refugees. But the Bangladeshi government counts these Rohingya as illegal economic migrants. Human Rights Watch urges the establishment of a mechanism through which UNHCR could gain consistent access to Rohingya detained as prohibited migrants and any other undocumented Rohingya who wish to make asylum claims.  """"Persons found to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Burma should be provided international protection in Bangladesh. Under the current climate in Burma, there should be no summary deportation of Rohingya,"""" said Risser. """"UNHCR must continue to provide a strong protection monitoring role both in the camps in Bangladesh and in Arakan state in Burma where the Rohingya voluntarily return.""""  Over the past two years, UNHCR has been in the process of handing over responsibility for assisting the reintegration of returning refugees in northern Arakan to a broader U.N. umbrella group of development-oriented agencies. Human Rights Watch strongly opposes the handover, believing that the lack of a UNHCR presence in the field could increase the risk of leaving the Rohingya unprotected against government abuses. UNHCR is the only U.N. organization with the mandate and expertise to protect the Rohingya. Instead of a reduction in the UNHCR presence, its protection role should be strengthened.  Rohingya repatriation formally recommenced in November 1998 after over a year's suspension, but under restrictive conditions set out by the Burmese government. One of the main conditions was the set quota of no more than fifty persons to return per week. In practice, this quota was rarely reached in the first year. As a result, the birth rate in the camps often exceeded the number of returnees, spelling a net growth in the population in the camps. The Burmese government has furthermore stated that it would only consider the return of the approximately 7,000 Rohingya refugees who had been previously cleared for repatriation prior to the 1997 suspension of returns. These restrictions would effectively deny the remaining 15,000 Rohingya of their right to return, should they wish to pursue it.  Human Rights Watch outlined recommendations to the governments of Burma and Bangladesh for durable solutions of the refugee crisis, including repatriation to Burma, local integration in Bangladesh, and resettlement in a third country. Some combination of these options is likely to be needed. The international monitoring group also urged Bangladesh's donors to make commitments of financial support to help pay for the local integration of the remaining Rohingya population.  But a lasting solution also requires increased pressure by the international community on the Burmese government to end serious abuses in Arakan state so that the Rohingya can return to Burma in safety and with full human rights guarantees.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Masiaka, located about fifty miles east of the capital Freetown, is near the front line of fighting between the RUF rebels and the pro-government forces. It is also near the site where two international journalists were killed on Wednesday by RUF rebels.    """"These fresh reports of RUF atrocities underscore the need for the international community to make protection of civilians its first priority in Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"U.N. forces must aim to expand the circle of protection beyond Freetown as soon as possible.""""     Soon after taking over 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage at the beginning of May, the RUF began an offensive action in the Masiaka region. Heavy reinforcements by the United Nations and British troops and a counter-offensive by government-allied militias repulsed the RUF rebels from the Masiaka area around May 14. During its week-long occupation of the area, the RUF committed acts of murder, mutilation, rape, looting, and abduction against the civilian population.     """"Kariatu"""" (not her real name), a forty-five-year-old farmer, told Human Rights Watch that she fled Masiaka town with her four children on May 11, when RUF fighters first attacked the town. On May 12, she was approached by four RUF fighters who asked her where she was going. When she responded she was going to Freetown, one of the RUF fighters responded, """"We make sure we kill you before reaching Freetown."""" The RUF fighters also told her, """"Since you civilians are not here for us, we are here to destroy you."""" The RUF fighters took away her two sons, aged twelve and seventeen, and she heard her sons screaming before hearing gunshots. After evidently killing the two sons, the RUF fighters left with her two daughters, aged eight and ten, and all of the family's possessions. When """"Kariatu"""" tried to beg the fighters to leave her two daughters, they threatened to kill her. """"Kariatu"""" is currently living in a camp for internally displaced near Freetown.     Sixteen-year-old """"Ramatu"""" (not her real name) fled Masiaka on May 12 with her two sisters, aged two and five. On the same day, she was captured by a large group of RUF rebels and taken to a base in the jungle. On the way there she saw five other abducted girls of about the same age. She was kept at the jungle base for five days, where she was gang raped by """"many, many men."""" """"Ramatu"""" told Human Rights Watch that she was pinned down with a knife held to her throat, and was raped while her two young sisters were close by. After one rape, the RUF rebels threatened to amputate her hands.

First, we would like to recognize and welcome the contribution that British forces have made to securing the protection of civilians in Freetown and enabling the ongoing reinforcement of U.N. troops.   However, we also wish to highlight our concerns regarding the announcement that the United Kingdom will supply the Sierra Leonean government with light weapons and ammunition. Human Rights Watch is very concerned that British-supplied weapons may be made available to government-allied groups known to have committed gross human rights abuse. We are also gravely concerned about recent credible reports that child soldiers are being re-recruited and may as such be the recipients of some of these arms. While we recognize that the government of President Kabbah must take up its responsibility to secure Freetown and eventually the entire country, we call on you to ensure that no military equipment provided to the Sierra Leonean government is made available, directly or indirectly, to pro-government forces who are known to have frequently committed serious human rights abuses, or to child soldiers. Abusive government allies include the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council/ex-Sierra Leone army (AFRC/ex-SLA) and the Civilian Defense Forces (CDF). Under the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1171 (1998) lifting the arms embargo on the government of Sierra Leone, an international arms embargo remained in place on all non-governmental forces in the country.     The horrific abuses committed by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) are well known, but Human Rights Watch has also established the abysmal human rights record of pro-government forces. Before it switched sides to support the government, the AFRC/ex-SLA was allied with the RUF and was responsible for many widespread atrocities. In 1998, for example, AFRC/ex-SLA soldiers participated in a campaign of mass mutilation, rape, and killing that continued into the January 1999 rebel occupation of Freetown in which the AFRC/ex-SLA participated in large numbers. The CDF militias who have fought on the government's behalf have also committed gross abuses, though to a lesser extent. For example, CDF forces have been responsible for indiscriminate killings, summary executions, and torture. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that the abusive behavior of these groups has improved. Last week Human Rights Watch made public credible allegations that government-allied troops were torturing and executing suspected members of the RUF. This week it was reported that pro-government forces, as well as the RUF, are re-recruiting demobilized child soldiers. Secretary General Kofi Annan, in his May 19 report on the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, reported that UNAMSIL human rights officers had observed that up to twenty-five percent of soldiers fighting with the CDF, AFRC/ex-SLA and Sierra Leone Army were under the age of eighteen, and some freely admitted to being between ages seven and fourteen.   Currently, the government of Sierra Leone is relying on the AFRC/ex-SLA and the CDFs to help the Sierra Leonean army combat the RUF. Under these circumstances, any weapons provided to the government risk being handed out to irregular, undisciplined, and unaccountable fighters. In fact, an unconfirmed May 22 report in The Independent suggested that the Sierra Leonean government already had begun to re-arm irregular forces. This raises the possibility that the planned provision of arms from the United Kingdom will enable the Sierra Leonean government to distribute weapons from its own stocks to the AFRC/ex-SLA and the CDF, especially as it has been reported that as many as 10,000 British weapons already in Freetown may be made available to the Sierra Leonean government.   We welcome the U.K. government's statement yesterday that it will remind the government of Sierra Leone of its commitment, made last year when the weapons were shipped to Freetown as part of a planned training program for the new army, that """"U.K.-supplied weapons would be used only by regular soldiers and in accordance with international law,"""" but we feel that this is insufficient to address the very real danger that British-supplied weapons could be used by abusive armed groups in Sierra Leone or could free up other weapons to be provided by the government itself.   Instead, we urge you to demand explicit guarantees from the Sierra Leonean government that it will not provide any military equipment, either directly or indirectly, to the AFRC/ex-SLA or CDF. Moreover, we call on you to put in place mechanisms to monitor the distribution and use of arms and ammunition, to ensure that no weapons transfers to abusive pro-government forces or to forces that are not under effective governmental control take place, whether or not these would violate the U.N. arms embargo. As you may be aware, the U.N. arms embargo resolution cited above required the government of Sierra Leone to mark and register all imported weapons, and to notify the U.N. of such imports. We urge you to build on that requirement by demanding that the Sierra Leonean government also register to whom weapons are distributed. We further recommend that U.K. government representatives be charged with supervising this process and periodically reporting on any irregularities, including allegations of abuses by the recipients of weapons, to the U.K. government and the United Nations. We also call on the U.K. government to press the government of Sierra Leone to ensure that its armed forces comply with international human rights standards and, importantly, are held accountable for any abuses.   In addition, we urge you to make any further military assistance conditional on a commitment by the Sierra Leonean government that children will neither be recruited nor used as soldiers by pro-government forces. In 1999, Human Rights Watch commended the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office for its agreement with the Government of Sierra Leone, conditioning a £10 million assistance package on Sierra Leone's commitment that children would not be used by the Sierra Leone Armed Forces or the Civil Defense Forces and that the Sierra Leonean government would help facilitate the demobilization and rehabilitation of former child soldiers. Unfortunately, the May 24 statement by the prime ministers's office that the U.K. would seek to ensure that its arms are not used by child soldiers falls far short of last year's agreement. Particularly in light of recent reports regarding the re-recruitment of child soldiers by both RUF and pro-government forces, we urge you to once again make material assistance conditional upon adequate safeguards to prevent the recruitment of children as soldiers.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Sierra Leone, United Kingdom","Arms"

In a statement released today in Ankara, Human Rights Watch expressed concern that an isolation regime currently in place at Kartal Special Type Prison in Istanbul may be a prototype for other prisons currently under construction around Turkey. The organization stressed the potential physical and mental harm to prisoners who are kept in solitary or small-group isolation--a regime that severely limits the range of human contact and the variety of activities and environment to which a prisoner has access.  The rights group's statement this morning came after organization representatives conducted a week of meetings to discuss the government's plans with Ministry of Justice officials and representatives of foreign governments and civil society. Human Rights Watch welcomed its discussions with the government and urgently pressed for greater transparency surrounding government plans to reshape Turkey's prisons. The Turkish government has set in motion plans to begin housing prisoners in cells for up to three prisoners, moving away from the use of the existing sixty-person wards that have been plagued by violence and abuse committed by both prisoners and security personnel. Eleven new """"F-Type"""" prisons consisting exclusively of small-group cells to house detainees convicted of organized crimes and crimes under the Anti-Terror law are currently under construction. They are expected to be completed in the coming months.  Ministry of Justice officials promise that the new F-Type prisons will improve conditions in prisons and bring them up to international standards. Human Rights Watch cautioned, however, that unless the new system includes plans for prisoners to spend time out of the cell units for recreational, social, and vocational activities, it could violate human rights.  """"In principle, the move to cells could improve prison conditions,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Human Rights Watch researcher. """"But without opportunities for prisoners to leave the cell unit, the new system could amount to an isolation regime that will cause prisoners mental and physical harm. We would oppose any such move.""""  The Turkish government's plans for running the new prisons have been shrouded in secrecy and Ministry of Justice officials told Human Rights Watch they were still working out the details. """"Unfortunately, the government's silence about its plans has led many to assume the worst,"""" Sugden stated.  It is widely believed that the new """"F-Type"""" prisons will be run like Kartal Special Type prison in Istanbul. Prisoners and ex-prisoners of the Kartal facility and their families describe an extremely restrictive regime at the prison. Most prisoners typically sit in their cells alone or in the company of three to six other inmates, for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, with limited activities, stimulation, or exposure to the outside world.  International prison experts have determined that such a regime may seriously endanger the mental and physical health of the inmates and amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in violation of international standards. Human Rights Watch's request for permission to visit the Kartal facility was not granted.  Human Rights Watch urged the government to provide prisoners with details about the regime to which they may be transferred and reiterate to the prisoner population its unambiguous commitment to operate the cell system humanely and in compliance with international standards. In order to restore confidence in Turkey's troubled prison system, the group also recommended that these plans include arrangements for nongovernmental organizations to enter and monitor Turkey's prisons regularly.  The Turkish government's plans for its prisons could bring criticism in international human rights bodies at a time when the government is trying to improve its international image. Considering the proposed cell system during a visit to Turkey in 1997, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture concluded that """"in the absence of a significant improvement in activities for prisoners, the introduction of smaller living units will almost certainly cause more problems than it solves."""" Last week, the United Nations Committee Against Torture criticized the United States for its use of a restrictive isolation regime similar to that anticipated in Turkey.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

""""The President and Congress should agree on steps to make this commission truly meaningful and effective if it is to replace the annual trade debate,"""" he added. As the Clinton Administration works to line up votes for PNTR, doing away with the annual trade review, the proposed China Commission has become an essential element of the Administration's policy, endorsed by both the White House and key Republican leaders. The proposal is roughly modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), established by Congress in 1976 to monitor compliance with the Helsinki Final Act. But in the case of China, there is no parallel international agreement, and the Chinese foreign ministry has already attacked the commission idea. Human Rights Watch, based on its positive experience working with the CSCE, believes that a high-level commission on China, backed up by a permanent professional staff with a strong human rights background, could conduct useful investigations and missions, examine cases of individual abuses, as well as issue an annual report assessing human rights, worker rights and development of the rule of law. According to the draft legislation, the Commission's report also """"may contain recommendations for legislative or executive action."""" The scope of the actions is undefined. The draft law does require a hearing by the House Committee on International Relations on the commission's report.

As growing numbers of militia from the South Lebanon Army are deserting, Human Rights Watch also called on the Lebanese government to publicly announce clear procedures for those who surrender. Megally noted that former combatants who lay down their arms are protected under international humanitarian law.  Lebanese lawyers reported to Human Rights Watch last week that the intelligence branch of the Lebanese army has interrogated former SLA combatants in incommunicado detention, sometimes for weeks, before lawyers were allowed to meet with them.

However, the rights organization strongly urged both bilateral and multilateral donors -- including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank -- to strictly condition any direct assistance to the Cambodian government on its demonstrable progress in prosecuting human rights abusers, strengthening the rule of law, implementing judicial reforms, initiating anti-corruption measures, and bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. Human Rights Watch also called on donors in Paris to establish an official working group on human rights and rule of law. """"So far, only an informal donor group has met to discuss issues of good governance and rule of law,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"In order to establish clear benchmarks and mark the Cambodian government's progress, donors should set up an official human rights working group. This should be a major priority for the CG."""" At this year's CG meeting the Cambodian government is expecting pledges of U.S. $500 million in aid, an increase from the $470 million aid package pledged at the last donors' conference in February 1999 in Tokyo. Among the recommendations that Human Rights Watch urges donors to raise with the government at the CG meeting are: Steps to end impunity: Depoliticize the Supreme Council of Magistracy and the Supreme Court, pass critically-needed laws including a new law on criminal procedure and a new criminal code, enact legal prohibitions against out-of-court financial compensation for major criminal offenses, and conduct independent judicial inquiries about police actions that involve death or injury to suspects. Addressing Corruption: Press for increases in salaries of government officials, advocate for the periodic rotation of police and court personnel to different departments or geographical locations, and insist that the SCM Disciplinary Council discipline or dismiss court officials for failure to prosecute cases and for law enforcement officials to be disciplined for failure to investigate and report on cases. Protecting Political Rights and Freedom of Association: Provide funding and speak up in defense of Cambodia' s domestic human rights monitors, as well as the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; press the Cambodian government to insure the rights of all persons, regardless of political affiliation, to free assembly and membership in political parties of their choice; and insist that the government bring to justice perpetrators of violence and intimidation against human rights workers and individuals expressing peaceful political opinions. Preparing Free and Fair Commune Elections: Insist that the government set clear benchmarks for electoral reform in advance of the commune elections, including reformulating the National Election Commission as a neutral and non-partisan body, providing equal access to the media to candidates, and providing for adequate numbers of trained local and international observers. Take immediate steps to disarm and dismantle the commune militias and dissolve the People's Protection Units, which could be used to implement political violence by the ruling party. Encourage the government to pass a Commune Election Law in which candidates would run on an individual basis and not as political party member, in order to reduce political violence. Bringing the Khmer Rouge to Justice: Donors should express their support for the U.N.'s role in any international tribunal of the Khmer Rouge and make clear to Prime Minister Hun Sen that they will not provide funding, technical assistance, judges, or other support until minimum standards of justice are guaranteed. The U.N. Secretary-General must be empowered to approve all judges and prosecutors who participate in the tribunal, the majority of whom should be non-Cambodians. The proposed arbitration panel to settle conflicts between co-prosecutors should be abandoned and prosecutors given independent authority to indict. Rules of procedure should be patterned on the rules and statutes of the international tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and other relevant international treaties. The law should include a well-conceived protection plan -- under the auspices of the U.N. -- to ensure that witnesses and all participants in the process have adequate guarantees for their personal security.","Asia, Cambodia",""

In addition to violating international law, the Israeli attacks on electrical facilities also violated the April 1996 Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Understanding, designed to protect civilians and reduce civilian casualties on both sides of the border. The Understanding was brokered in part by the United States. Israel's actions threaten to scuttle the fragile agreement, and plunge southern Lebanon and northern Israel back into yet another violent cycle of broad attacks on the civilians on both sides of the border. The AGM-114 """"Hellfire"""" is a short-range, air-to-ground missile used on AH-64A Apache, AH-64D Longbow Apache, AH-1W Super Cobra, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, and Special Operations UH-60 helicopters. The first large-scale Israeli military use of Hellfire missiles was in the May 1996 """"Grapes of Wrath"""" Operation in southern Lebanon during which many civilian structures were targeted and some 154 Lebanese civilians were killed, and another 351 civilians were injured. The AGM-142 is a medium-range Imaging-Infra-Red (IIR) or TV-guided, air-to-ground missile. It is produced by Precision Guided Systems United States (PGSUS) Limited Liability Company of Orlando, Florida, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, and Raphael, an Israeli firm. Lockheed states that the missile is effective against """"high-value ground and sea targets such as power plants, missile sites, bridges, ships, and bunkers."""" Human Rights Watch holds that any state has the right to procure weapons for its legitimate self-defense, but maintains that it must also respect international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases where U.S.-origin weapons appear to have been used by Israeli forces in violation of international humanitarian law. It is possible that the AGM-114 will be used again by the Israel Air Force to attack electrical facilities or other civilian targets, and that the AGM-142D has been, or will be, used by Israel to attack electrical facilities or other civilian targets. Selling additional air-to-ground missiles to Israel so soon after it blatantly violated international law would send the wrong signal to the Israeli government.  This is clearly the wrong sale at the wrong time. We urge you not to go forward with the sale of air-to-ground missiles to Israel until the U.S. receives assurances from the Israeli government that it will refrain from attacking power plants and other civilian structures in Lebanon.  Enclosed is a Human Rights Watch Backgrounder with additional information on the missiles, the proposed sales, Israel's attacks, and the legal analysis.

In at least one of the attacks Israel apparentlyused U.S. supplied air-to-ground missiles to damage Lebanon's civilian electrical infrastructure.Despite the international outrage, the United States has not protested Israel's actions. Rather, theU.S. continues to sell to Israel additional advanced air-to-ground missiles that could be used infuture attacks.Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. Government not to go forward with these sales until Israel provides assurances that it will not use U.S. supplied missiles to attack civilian structures in Lebanon. To proceed with the sales would send the wrong signal to Israel such a short time after it violated international humanitarian law (IHL) by deliberately targeting Lebanon's electrical infrastructure.U.S. military equipment plays an important role in Israeli attacks on civilian targets. In the attack on the Bsalim electrical station on May 5, 2000, it appears the Israeli Air Force used U.S. attack helicopters and missiles. Workers at the plant said they heard helicopters and described three series of attacks.(1) The attacks completely destroyed three of the six transformers at the facility.(2) The helicopters apparently fired U.S.-supplied AGM-114 Hellfire laser-guided missiles.(3) In a previous Israeli attack on Bsalim, on May 16, 1996, U.S.-built F16 fighter planes dropped laser-guided bombs on the electrical station.(4)The U.S., however, continues to sell Israel large quantities of weapons. On March 8, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would sell to Israel forty-one AGM-142D air to ground missiles. The same month Israel also signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the modernization of twelve of its AH-64A Apache attack helicopters to the AH-64D Apache Longbow configuration.(5) The Apache upgrades were part of a larger Israeli request for helicopter equipment and missiles, including 480 latest-generation AGM-114L3 Hellfire missiles.(6)The May 5, 2000 Israeli attacks, as well as previous attacks on February 8, 2000, and June 24, 1999, were clear violations of international humanitarian law. The electrical stations were civilian facilities and played no part in Hizballah's military campaign to oust the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Israeli-occupied area of southern Lebanon. International humanitarian law only allows attacks against """"military objectives."""" Military objectives are """"objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.""""(7) The Israeli destruction of Lebanese power stations has had no discernable effect on Hizballah's military efforts, and the attack only punished the Lebanese population. With each attack, large parts of Lebanon have been plunged into darkness, and the Lebanese state electrical utility has been forced to ration electricity to the entire country.In addition to violating international law, the Israeli attacks on electrical facilities also violated the April 1996 Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Understanding, designed to protect civilians and reduce civilian casualties on both sides of the border. The Understanding, brokered in part by the United States, has somewhat limited the impact of the fighting on the civilian population. The Israeli military's actions threatened to scuttle the fragile agreement, and plunge southern Lebanon and northern Israel back into yet another violent cycle of broad attacks on the civilians on both sides of the border. The U.S. State Department has said, """"We do not believe that Israeli attacks against civilian infrastructure and populated areas will solve the problem,"""" adding, """"We believe that April 1996 Understanding is an important undertaking which both sides need to adhere to.""""(8)The War in LebanonLebanon has been the scene of combat between Israeli military units and various guerrilla groups since the 1970s. Since 1978 the Israel Defense Forces, with the help of a surrogate militia that it arms and finances, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), has occupied part of southern Lebanon, ostensibly to prevent guerrilla incursions into and rocket attacks on northern Israel.(9) These military forces have been locked in a conflict with Lebanese and Palestinian resistance groups--Hizballah (Party of God) is the largest fighting to expel the IDF from Lebanon.(10)The war in southern Lebanon is characterized by frequent attacks, with remote-controlled mines, mortars, and rockets, by resistance groups on IDF/SLA patrols and positions in the occupied area. Sometimes these attacks are launched from locations close to Lebanese villages or United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) positions. In retaliation, IDF aircraft bomb and IDF/SLA units shell areas where the guerrillas are suspected to be hiding. Sometimes these attacks are indiscriminate in nature. Israeli targets have included Lebanese villages and surrounding areas, leading to civilian casualties. In response to civilian casualties, Hizballah has fired indiscriminate Katyusha rockets at Israel, sometimes leading to Israeli civilian casualties. Several times over the last decade these military reprisals on both sides have led to major Israeli military operations, which in addition to attacks on guerrilla positions include targeting civilian infrastructure to punish the Lebanese government and population for allowing resistance groups to operate against Israeli forces in occupied southern Lebanon.The latest sustained Israeli military campaign was """"Operation Grapes of Wrath,"""" from April 11 to April 27, 1996. Some 154 Lebanese civilians were killed and 351 were injured. (Three Israeli civilians were seriously injured in Hizballah rocket attacks during this period.) This operation ended in late April after international intervention and the negotiation of a written """"understanding,"""" which stipulated:1. Armed groups in Lebanon will not carry out attacks by Katyusha rockets or by any kind of weapon into Israel.2. Israel and those cooperating with it will not fire any kind of weapon at civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.3. Beyond this, the two parties commit to ensuring that under no circumstance will civilians be targets of attack and the civilian population and industrial and electrical installations will not be used as launching grounds for attacks.(11)Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and the United States are members of the Monitoring Group that monitors the application of the understanding and hears complaints about violations from both sides.On April 16, 2000, Israel announced it would no longer participate in the Monitoring Group meetings, claiming that Hizballah does not act in accordance with the Understanding, by firing from Lebanese villages, and that the chairs of the Monitoring Group, France and the United States, were unable to contain Hizballah. Israel said it would rejoin the Monitoring Group on the condition that Hizballah refrain from shelling Israeli positions from civilian villages for a one-week period.(12)Daily attacks between the combatants continue. Civilians continue to be the principal victims of the violence. According to the U.S. State Department Human Rights Reports for 1999, 90 percent of the people injured in southern Lebanon were civilians, and IDF/SLA units were responsible for some 77 percent of all civilian injuries.The IDF, SLA, and Lebanese combatants also sustained losses. It was the death of four Israeli soldiers and wounding of eleven more in southern Lebanon in less than a week that led Prime Minister Barak to decide, on February 7, to retaliate by attacking the electrical stations,(13) in clear violation of international humanitarian law.It is important to note the bombing of electrical stations is part of a broader pattern of deliberate Israeli attacks on civilian infrastructure in Lebanon. Less than a year previously, on June 24, 1999, Israeli aircraft bombed the electrical facilities at Jamhour, Bsalim, Baalbeck, Bint Jbail, and a power relay station north of Sidon. IDF Brig. Gen. Dan Halutz said at a press conference on June 25 that the infrastructure targets """"had been selected a long time ago,"""" and that """"the government decided to carry out an attack on Lebanese infrastructure and not only on Hizballah objectives...in order to stress that all power brokers in Lebanon who support Hizballah's murderous activity are liable to attack.""""(14)On March 5, 2000, the Israeli government passed a resolution for the IDF to leave southern Lebanon and redeploy along the Israel-Lebanon border by July. The move, however, does not ensure peace or safety for the Lebanese people. The same day, Prime Minister Barak warned on Israeli TV, """"We do not suggest to anyone to try to test our resolve to protect the citizens of this country from the international border.""""(15)Prohibitions against attacks on civilian infrastructureInternational humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, governs the conduct of military operations in southern Lebanon. In the case of the civilian population and civilian buildings, international humanitarian law requires that, """"the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.""""(16)In Lebanon, however, Israel fails to observe this requirement by repeatedly targeting civilian electrical facilities. In a letter faxed to Human Rights Watch in 1994, Col. Ahaz Ben-Ari, then Head of International Law Branch, Israel Defense Forces, included electrical supply systems in a list of civilian structures that the IDF would not deliberately target. However the IDF appears to have reversed its position. Since 1996, IDF fighter-bombers have targeted and heavily damaged Lebanese electrical stations three times, at enormous cost to the Lebanese government and civilian population. According to the Lebanese Minster of Electricity and Water Resources, the June 1999 attack cost U.S.$50 million to repair; the February 2000 attack is estimated to have caused twice as much damage; and the May 5 damage may cost the Lebanese utility another $50 million to fix.(17)Although an electrical facility may sometimes provide electricity to military units, it may only be targeted if it is shown to make an """"effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.""""(18) In addition, if the facility does in some way contribute to military action, the rule of proportionality requires that the """"incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or any combination thereof"""" must be proportional to the """"concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.""""(19)Israel has not shown that its attacks on Lebanese electrical stations provide any direct military advantage. Previous attacks have not reduced Hizballah's ability to operate against the IDF/SLA. Past Israeli arguments that these attacks place pressure on the Lebanese government to reign in Hizballah also ring false. Already in 1996, Israeli Ambassador Gad Yaacobi said at the United Nations that: """"The Lebanese government does not have the ability--or the will--to control Hizballah activities.""""(20)The AGM-114The AGM-114 """"Hellfire"""" is a short-range, air-to-ground missile used on AH-64A Apache, AH-64D Longbow Apache, AH-1W Super Cobra, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, and Special Operations UH-60 helicopters. There are currently six different production models: AGM-114A/B/C/F, AGM-114K (Hellfire II) and AGM-114L (Longbow Hellfire). The Hellfire missile homes on a laser spot projected from ground observers, other aircraft, or the launching aircraft's own laser designator. The latest generation Longbow Hellfire has millimeter wave radar fire-and-forget guidance system that is also more effective in adverse weather conditions. (21)The 100-pound Hellfire missile's maximum range is approximately eight kilometers. The AGM-114A/B/C has a high-explosive shaped charge warhead and is effective against tanks, bunkers, buildings, radar and communication equipment. The AGM-114F/K/L has a tandem warhead that is more effective against reactive armor.(22)The Hellfire was first widely used by U.S. forces during the Gulf War. After the Gulf War an undisclosed number of Hellfire missiles were transferred to the Israeli military.(23) In 1995 Israel purchased $45 million worth of Hellfire II (AGM-142K) missiles.(24) The first large-scale Israeli military use of Hellfire missiles was in the May 1996 """"Grapes of Wrath"""" Operation in southern Lebanon during which many civilian structures were targeted and some 154 Lebanese civilians were killed, and another 351 civilians were injured.(25)The AGM-114A/B/C/F/K is produced by Boeing Corporation (formerly Rockwell International) and Lockheed Martin (formerly Martin Marietta). The Longbow Hellfire is produced by Longbow Limited Liability Company, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Systems and Northrop Grumman Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector.(26)The November 1999 Israeli request for AH-64D Longbow Helicopter upgrades and 480 AGM-114L3 Longbow Hellfire missiles is apparently in final negotiations.(27) A separate contract for an unknown number of Longbow Hellfire missiles initiated on July 7, 1998 will be completed by August 31, 2005.(28)The AGM-142The AGM-142 is a medium-range Imaging-Infra-Red (IIR) or TV guided, air-to-ground missile. The manufacturer states that it is effective against """"high-value ground and sea targets such as power plants, missile sites, bridges, ships, and bunkers.""""(29) Weighing about 3,000 pounds when launched, its classified range exceeds fifty nautical miles. The AGM-142 can be fitted with an 800-pound blast fragmentation or an I-800 penetration warhead.(30)The AGM-142 is a derivative of the Israeli designed """"Popeye"""" air-to-ground missile. In 1990 the U.S. Air Force evaluated the missile and purchased several hundred from Israel. The """"D"""" upgrade to the AGM-142 was financed by the United States, and incorporated guidance improvements.The improved weapon is produced by Precision Guided Systems United States (PGSUS) Limited Liability Company of Orlando, Florida, a join venture between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, and Raphael, an Israeli firm. In early 1997, PGSUS sold Israel 45 AGM-142D missiles.(31) Since then the United States has sold, or approved sales of, AGM-142 missiles to a number of countries, including Australia, Greece and South Korea.(32)The U.S. proposed sale would be for """"41 missiles with data links (including 33 with Z-seeker heads and eight without seeker heads), containers, captive air training sets, spare and repair parts, publications and technical data, U.S. Government and contractor technical and logistics personnel services, and other related elements of program support.""""(33) An additional deal for the sale of two spare AGM-142 control sections was announced on March 31, 2000.(34)Sending the wrong signalHuman Rights Watch has documented numerous cases where U.S.-origin weapons appear to have been used by Israeli forces in violation of international humanitarian law.(35) The United States government has never publicly protested this misuse of U.S. weapons. It is possible that the AGM-114 will be used again by the Israel Air Force to attack electrical facilities or other civilian targets, and that the AGM-142 may be used in the future. In light of the recent Israeli attacks, these are clearly the wrong sales at the wrong time.Human Rights Watch holds that any state has the right to procure weapons for its legitimate self-defense, but maintains that it must also respect international humanitarian law. Selling additional air-to-ground missiles to Israel so soon after Israel blatantly violated international law would send the wrong signal to the Israeli government. Indeed these weapons could be used in Israeli attacks on civilian targets in Lebanon. Human Rights Watch therefore urges the U.S. government not to go forward with the sale of any U.S. air-to-ground missiles to Israel until the U.S. receives assurances from the Israeli government that it will not use those weapons to attack power plants and other civilian structures in Lebanon.1.

According to Robert Fisk, a British journalist who saw the remains of two missiles at Bsalim, the tail section of the missile was exactly like that of an unexploded Hellfire missile he saw in southern Lebanon in 1996. Coding on the missile fragments was also similar to that on the unexploded Hellfire missile in 1996. Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Robert Fisk, May 16, 2000. The damage described by engineers also suggests that a missile with a shaped charge warhead, like the AGM-114 was used to attack the facility.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/05/19/letter-un-security-council-members-justice-un-mandate-and-arms-sierra-leone","Letter to UN Security Council Members on Justice the UN Mandate and Arms in Sierra Leone","Letter to U.N. Security Council Members on Justice, the U.N. Mandate, and Arms in Sierra Leone","","05/19/2000","Excellency,   Current events in Sierra Leone show the urgent need for the Security Council to establish a criminal process to bring to justice gross abusers of human rights; to strengthen the United Nations mandate and capacity in that country to protect civilians; and to address violations of the U.N. arms embargo against Sierra Leonean rebels.   An International Criminal Tribunal   Human Rights Watch calls on the Security Council to establish immediately an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone.   In July 1999, when the Lomé Accord was signed, Human Rights Watch denounced its blanket amnesty for the horrendous abuses that had been committed against the Sierra Leonean people. """"Time and again, the United Nations' experience has shown that peace accords built on impunity are shaky and do not hold,"""" we wrote to the Secretary-General. In an historic move, the U.N. added a reservation to its acceptance of the Lomé accord, stating that it did not recognize the amnesty insofar as it purported to apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, in a resolution passed last month, confirmed this approach and stated: """"the United Nations holds the understanding that the amnesty provisions of the [Lomé] Agreement shall not apply to international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, and affirms that all persons who commit or authorize serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law at any time are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to bring those responsible to justice.""""   The Security Council should use the current crisis and the apprehension of Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh to begin the overdue process of holding RUF leaders and others accountable for the atrocities they have committed.   The Council should authorize immediately and establish as soon as possible an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone with jurisdiction over all crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and others serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed at least since March 1991, when the RUF launched a rebellion to overthrow the Sierra Leonean government.   The Council should reconfirm explicitly that the purported Lomé amnesty does not apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law regardless of when these crimes were committed.   Because of the inevitable time required to establish an international criminal tribunal, the Council should immediately send investigators to Sierra Leone to collect evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both before and after the Lomé Accord, in anticipation of its use by the International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone and other competent courts that respect international fair-trial standards. Beginning this process of gathering evidence now is essential for maximizing the potential of the tribunal to deter further atrocities.   A New U.N. Mandate and the Means to Uphold It   Given the resumption of fighting, the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), as currently constituted, is clearly no longer the appropriate authority to carry out what should be its principal task - ensuring the protection of civilians in Sierra Leone. Even before the recent crisis, UNAMSIL's carefully qualified mandate - to protect """"civilians under imminent threat of violence"""" when it was """"within its capabilities and areas of deployment"""" - was inadequate to ensure that abuse of civilians ceased. Furthermore, even this limited mandate was not fulfilled because the Security Council never secured for UNAMSIL the necessary means and leadership. These shortcomings are of particular concern now because, as you are well aware, serious abuses against civilians in Sierra Leone have typically occurred within the context of RUF combat activities. Civilians are now at grave risk in certain parts of the country and, despite what should be its paramount duty, UNAMSIL is not currently offering them any protection.   The Security Council should urgently give a new mandate and all necessary means to a reconstituted UNAMSIL or an alternative international force to enable it as quickly as possible to protect civilians throughout Sierra Leone. The new force should be charged with coordinating all international forces in the country as well as pro-government Sierra Leonean fighters. It should deploy throughout the country as soon as possible. And it should have the clear duty and means to protect civilians.   The new international force must operate with a policy of """"zero tolerance"""" towards violations of international humanitarian law and other abuses by rebel troops or anyone else, including forces under U.N. control as well as the Sierra Leonean troops and their allies.   The new force should have the power to arrest individuals caught in the act of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should also be given the power now to arrest suspects once they are indicted by the future International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone or any other competent court that respects international fair-trial standards.   Tightening the Arms Embargo   Human Rights Watch has been concerned that the arms embargo and other sanctions against rebel forces (as authorized by Resolutions 1132 and 1171) have not been enforced. In recent months, instead of disarming, RUF rebels have obtained additional weapons, seizing many of them from U.N. peacekeepers. In addition, Human Rights Watch has been concerned by reports that, despite being subject to an international arms embargo since 1997, RUF rebels have imported weapons via neighboring countries, including Liberia, which is also subject to a U.N. arms embargo. (We have made these reports public, most recently in a May 15 briefing paper.)

Recent developments, notably the capture of RUF leader Foday Sankoh, vividly highlight the need for the United States to support a criminal process to bring to justice those responsible for gross abuses of human rights in Sierra Leone. In addition, we strongly urge the U.S. to work to strengthen the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone's (UNAMSIL) mandate and capacity to protect civilians. While we understand that the release of the U.N. hostages remains a key U.S. priority, it should not be pursued to the exclusion of these other pressing needs.   On the question of justice, the U.S. should take the lead in ensuring that the mistakes of the Lomé Accord are not repeated or resurrected. Lomé illustrates the hazards of trying to build a peace without justice. It shows the danger of hoping that those responsible for atrocities of the past would somehow reform when their impunity only encouraged recidivism. To avoid repeating the errors of the past, the international community should firmly and unequivocally reject the amnesty provisions of Lomé. The latest round of RUF abuses and the apprehension of Foday Sankoh permit initiating the overdue process of holding RUF leaders and others accountable for the atrocities they have committed. The U.S. should call on the Security Council to establish an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone. The tribunal should have jurisdiction over all crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of humanitarian law committed since March 1991, when the RUF launched an offensive to overthrow the Sierra Leonean government.   Because of the inevitable time required to establish an international criminal tribunal, the U.S. should call for investigators to be deployed as soon as possible to begin carefully compiling evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity that would be required for eventual prosecutions by the International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone and other competent courts that respect international fair-trial standards.   The urgency of moving forward with a tribunal and credible investigations was put in stark relief by the State Department's press briefing of May 17. Spokesman Richard Boucher made a series of contradictory and deliberately ambiguous statements regarding the status of Foday Sankoh and the peace process. First he said that Sankoh's fate and the question of whether he could be rehabilitated was up to the government and people of Sierra Leone. Later, when asked whether recent events made Sankoh a war criminal or terrorist, Boucher replied: """"We've said he's in violation of the Lomé Accords. We've expressed our serious and deep concern about the action of taking U.N. soldiers hostage. But the next step and exactly what category-category implies some specific action, and that really has to be left up to the government of Sierra Leone."""" As to whether Sankoh is a war criminal, he said: """"[G]etting someone on a war crimes charge is a different thing than saying he's violated a peace accord. Now, whatever happens in that direction really we'll be seeing in the coming days. There is no decision on that point.""""   The U.S. and the international community should not defer to the Sierra Leonean government on such a critical matter. The task of prosecuting those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity is an urgent international concern. It requires resources that Sierra Leone does not possess. And it needs the process of gathering evidence to begin now - at a time when Sierra Leone is in no position to start - so as to maximize the potential for the tribunal to deter future atrocities.   Ultimately, the rule of law must be re-established in Sierra Leone, and in the short term, mob rule must be avoided at all costs. The U.S. should insist that due process of law be respected in all cases, including that of Foday Sankoh. We were alarmed to learn that State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, when asked directly whether the U.S. thought Sankoh ought to receive fair treatment, responded: """"should [the people and government of Sierra Leone] decide on a course that requires fair treatment, or a lawyer, or anything else, we'd certainly support that."""" Such a statement is dangerously inflammatory in a situation as volatile as Sierra Leone.   Given the resumption of fighting, UNAMSIL, as currently constituted, is clearly no longer the appropriate authority to carry out what should be its principal task-ensuring the protection of civilians in Sierra Leone. Even before the recent crisis, UNAMSIL's carefully qualified mandate-to protect """"civilians under imminent threat of violence"""" when it was """"within its capabilities and areas of deployment""""-was inadequate to ensure that abuse of civilians ceased. Furthermore, even this limited mandate was not fulfilled because the Security Council never secured for UNAMSIL the necessary means and leadership. These shortcomings are of particular concern now because, as you are well aware, serious abuses against civilians in Sierra Leone have typically occurred within the context of RUF combat activities. Civilians are now at grave risk in certain parts of the country and, despite what should be its paramount duty, UNAMSIL is not offering them any protection.   The U.S. should call on the Security Council to give a new mandate and all necessary means to a reconstituted UNAMSIL or an alternative international force to enable it as quickly as possible to protect civilians throughout Sierra Leone. The new force should be charged with coordinating all international forces in the country as well as pro-government Sierra Leonean fighters. It should deploy throughout the country as soon as possible. And it should have the clear duty and means to protect civilians.   The new international force must operate with a policy of """"zero tolerance"""" towards violations of international humanitarian law and other abuses by rebel troops or anyone else, including forces under U.N. control as well as the Sierra Leonean troops and their allies. The new force should have the power to arrest individuals caught in the act of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should also be given the power now to arrest suspects once they are indicted by the future International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone or any other competent court that respects international fair-trial standards.   Human Rights Watch is concerned about the continuing ability of rebel forces to acquire arms. In recent months, instead of disarming, RUF rebels have obtained additional weapons, seizing many of them from U.N. peacekeepers. In addition, Human Rights Watch has been concerned by reports that, despite being subject to an international arms embargo since 1997, RUF rebels have imported weapons via neighboring countries, including Liberia, which is also subject to a U.N. arms embargo. (We have made these reports public, most recently in a May 15 briefing paper) The RUF's ability to purchase weapons depends to a large extent on its continued control of Sierra Leone's diamond-producing areas, despite provisions in the Lomé Accord that the government shall """"exercise full control of the exploitation of gold, diamonds and other resources for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone."""" The U.S. should work for firm measures to stop the RUF from replenishing its military supplies and thus preparing itself for further violence and grave human rights abuses. Specifically, it should support the deployment of U.N. forces with the mandate and capability to rigorously enforce the arms embargo. The U.S. also should promote the creation of a U.N. inquiry into illegal arms flows to the RUF, including the apparent use of diamond revenues to finance weapons purchases.   U.S. statements continually refer to the implementation of the Lomé agreement and a return to a credible peace process. Another lesson of Lomé is that accommodating those responsible for atrocities-especially leaders of the RUF, but also the ex-SLA/AFRC and the civilian militias or civil defense forces commonly referred to as Kamajors-was an utter failure and does not bring sustainable peace. Accordingly, the U.S. should work to ensure that abusive forces do not continue to be rewarded with a power-sharing formula.   The U.S. has been a key player in Sierra Leone, and has a responsibility to continue its engagement. As a key architect of the unraveling Lomé Accord, the U.S. also has a responsibility to pursue a clear and forward-looking policy based on ending impunity for all sides and a firm commitment to protect civilians.

""""Time and again, the United Nations' experience has shown that peace accords built on impunity are shaky and do not hold,"""" we wrote to the Secretary-General. we wrote to the Secretary-General. In an historic move, the U.N. added a reservation to its acceptance of the Lomé accord, stating that it did not recognize the amnesty insofar as it purported to apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, in a resolution passed last month, confirmed this approach and stated: """"the United Nations holds the understanding that the amnesty provisions of the [Lomé] Agreement shall not apply to international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, and affirms that all persons who commit or authorize serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law at any time are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to bring those responsible to justice.""""     The Security Council should use the current crisis and the apprehension of Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh to begin the overdue process of holding RUF leaders and others accountable for the atrocities they have committed.       The Council should authorize immediately and establish as soon as possible an International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone with jurisdiction over all crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and others serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed at least since March 1991, when the RUF launched a rebellion to overthrow the Sierra Leonean government.     The Council should reconfirm explicitly that the purported Lomé amnesty does not apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law regardless of when these crimes were committed.     Because of the inevitable time required to establish an international criminal tribunal, the Council should immediately send investigators to Sierra Leone to collect evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both before and after the Lomé Accord, in anticipation of its use by the International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone and other competent courts that respect international fair-trial standards. Beginning this process of gathering evidence now is essential for maximizing the potential of the tribunal to deter further atrocities.     A New U.N. Mandate and the Means to Uphold It     Given the resumption of fighting, the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), as currently constituted, is clearly no longer the appropriate authority to carry out what should be its principal task - ensuring the protection of civilians in Sierra Leone. Even before the recent crisis, UNAMSIL's carefully qualified mandate - to protect """"civilians under imminent threat of violence"""" when it was """"within its capabilities and areas of deployment"""" - was inadequate to ensure that abuse of civilians ceased.

It should also be given the power now to arrest suspects once they are indicted by the future International Criminal Tribunal for Sierra Leone or any other competent court that respects international fair-trial standards.     Tightening the Arms Embargo     Human Rights Watch has been concerned that the arms embargo and other sanctions against rebel forces (as authorized by Resolutions 1132 and 1171) have not been enforced. In recent months, instead of disarming, RUF rebels have obtained additional weapons, seizing many of them from U.N. peacekeepers.

Our organizations are deeply concerned that the Acting Council of the Palestinian Bar Association continue to remove Palestinian human rights lawyers associated with human rights organizations from its list of practicing lawyers. The Acting Council removed active human rights lawyer Khader Shkirat, the director of LAW Society- an ICJ, FIDH, and OMCT affiliate. Mr. Shkirat received a letter stating that the Acting Council took this decision on 14 May 2000. The Acting Council's term of office expired on 9 May 2000. Mr. Shkirat is running as a candidate for the Bar Council elections. In a statement issued on 15 May 2000, we already expressed our deep concern that on 10 May 2000, the Acting Council removed six human rights lawyers associated with the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), also an ICJ and FIDH affiliate, and one lawyer from the Women's Legal and Social Counselling Center. These lawyers petitioned the Palestinian High Court, which in a welcome preliminary decision, issued on 17 May 2000, suspended the Acting Council's decision.  Our organizations remain alarmed by the punitive nature of these measures and by the lack of due process. We are further concerned that the action taken by the Acting Council may be politically motivated. Earlier, Mr. Shkirat was threatened with violence in an attempt to deter him from running for the Bar elections.  Our organizations wish to reiterate Principle 23 of the 1990 UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, which states: Lawyers like other citizens are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. In particular, they shall have the right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights and to join or form local, national or international organisation and attend their meetings, without suffering professional restrictions by reason of their lawful action or their membership in a lawful organisation. In exercising these rights, lawyers shall always conduct themselves in accordance with the law and the recognised standards and ethics of the legal profession.  As these lawyers are also human rights defenders, we also wish to emphasise that Article 12 of the 1998 UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders requires the State to  ... take all the necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration.  We, therefore, call once again on the Acting Council of the Palestinian Bar Association to rescind these measures. We also call upon the Palestinian Authority to ensure that human rights lawyers do not face threats, intimidation and professional sanctions because of their human rights activities.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

We believe NATO has an important role to play in promoting responsible arms trading practices by its partners and in assisting with the responsible disposal of surplus weapons. We have engaged in a dialogue with Secretary-General Robertson and his predecessor, Javier Solana, on this topic. In addition, we have raised concerns about arms-related issues directly with individual EAPC governments, including by exchanging correspondence with a number of PfP countries about national arms trade controls and surplus weapons stocks. We have been pleased to see a growing commitment by NATO and PfP countries, acting through the EAPC and in other fora, to address the problems posed by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In particular, efforts by the ad hoc EAPC working group on small arms have led to important action on several fronts, including the development of programs offered within the PfP framework to assist partner countries with stockpile security and destruction of surplus weapons (as outlined in a new Partnership Work Program chapter on small arms), as well as various meetings held to discuss scope for EAPC action on arms export controls. We understand that these consultations will be reported at the upcoming ministerials and, in light of the EAPC's ongoing work on these issues, we'd like to highlight three areas in which we hope there will be further progress. Stemming the Flow of Surplus Weapons Human Rights Watch has called on NATO to help remove excess arms from an already-glutted market by providing funds to finance the responsible disposal (e.g., through destruction) of excess military equipment held by partners and new allies. Such financing should be made available to address larger weapons systems, as well as small arms and light weapons. One precedent is offered by the United States, which in late 1997 purchased twenty-one surplus MiG-29 combat aircraft from Moldova to preempt their possible sale to Iran.  While new PfP programs regarding disposal of surplus small arms are optional, we feel that PfP countries should be actively encouraged to take advantage of all programs that will help address the proliferation of these weapons. In addition, where appropriate, NATO member states should arrange exchanges, by which the transfer of newer military equipment to PfP or new NATO states would be contingent on the recipient country's responsible disposal of quantities of surplus weapons. Such arrangements could do much to prevent weapons from ending up in the hands of abusive military forces.  Harmonization of Arms Trade Controls NATO also should address the larger problem of the need for strict arms trade controls. A number of PfP countries have a troubling record of arms transfers to human rights abusers, often involving both government-authorized deals and illicit arms trafficking by private traders who are not under adequate government control. We are encouraged to learn that the EAPC working group is considering initiatives to promote improvements in national export controls and has discussed harmonization of such controls. We hope that these initiatives are further developed and approved by the EAPC, and that the highest possible standards are adopted. Scrutiny of Aspirant Countries Human Rights Watch holds that NATO should use its considerable leverage to encourage aspirant members to undertake needed reforms. Recognizing that NATO expansion is not formally on the agenda of the spring ministerials, we feel that anticipated discussions on implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and Membership Action Plans (MAPs) submitted by candidate countries provide an important forum in which arms trade issues should be addressed. In these and future discussions related to NATO expansion, we urge you to explicitly link consideration of each aspirant country's NATO candidacy to the responsible disposal of surplus weapons and, more generally, strict arms trade controls.  Thank you very much for your consideration. Sincerely,  Stephen D. Goose, Acting Executive Director, Arms Division Lotte Leicht, Director, Brussels Office","Global","Arms"

""""This growing crisis demands immediate action, by both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Right Watch's Asia Division. """"The human rights of civilians caught in this conflict must be protected."""" Human Rights Watch urged Sri Lanka's chief aid donors -- including Japan, the European Union, Canada, and the U.S. -- to call on the Ministry of Defense and other relevant government agencies to redouble efforts to ensure that humanitarian organizations are allowed to deliver essential food and medical relief to rebel-controlled areas.  UNHCR has received reports that the government of India might not allow refugees fleeing the conflict to enter the country. Human Rights Watch urged the Indian government to honor the international legal obligation not to return refugees to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.  Previous bouts of heavy fighting in Sri Lanka's seventeen-year conflict have led to increased violence against civilians, particularly when significant territory has changed hands. This includes especially the hundreds of """"disappearances"""" that took place after the army wrested control of Jaffna from the LTTE in late 1995. In the northern and eastern parts of the country, the LTTE has tortured, killed, and """"disappeared"""" people it accused of being informers, and has imposed severe restrictions on freedom of movement by attempting to prevent internally displaced persons from relocating out of LTTE-held territory. The LTTE's use of child soldiers has caused many displaced persons to flee from LTTE territory. LTTE forces are also believed to be responsible for the bombing of civilians in Colombo and elsewhere.  In areas controlled by the Sri Lankan security forces, meanwhile, Tamil civilians are the frequent targets of arbitrary arrests and lengthy detentions without trial, custodial abuse that includes torture, and extrajudicial killings. On May 3, the government introduced new Emergency Regulations granting the police and armed forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention, restricting freedom of association, and censoring local and international media. After major gains by LTTE forces in the north, the government also banned all live television and radio programs and required government approval prior to transmission of all conflict-related news outside the country. """"The restrictions on journalists and on the activities and movement of humanitarian organizations have produced a virtual blackout of independent reporting on the situation and the lives that hang in the balance."""" said Jendrzejczyk. The government should ensure that humanitarian agencies and NGOs are able to carry out independent assessments of ongoing humanitarian needs and monitor population displacement. Human Rights Watch also urged the LTTE to allow relief agencies to function and impress on its forces the critically important and nonpartisan role played by these agencies. Sri Lanka's displaced population, already estimated at 800,000 island-wide, has born the brunt of this lengthy conflict. Many are living in extreme poverty and have not led a settled existence more than a decade.","Asia, Sri Lanka","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

The rights organization urged the authorities of Sierra Leone and the international community to take immediate steps to prevent a descent into ‘mob justice' in Sierra Leone.     We are receiving credible reports that government-allied forces in Sierra Leone are torturing and executing suspected RUF fighters, including RUF fighters who have given up their arms and completed rehabilitation programs,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The military authorities must take immediate steps to rein in their fighters and prevent a descent into mob justice."""" Takirambudde urged the United Nations to use its large presence in Sierra Leone to stop such abuses.     A Sierra Leone paramilitary commander, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Human Rights Watch that suspected RUF members had been taken to a government-allied paramilitary base in Freetown on the 8th of May. According to the commander, the five men were severely tortured and beaten, and the commander personally saw that their ears had been cut off. When the commander returned later that day, he was informed that the five had been taken away and he believed they had been executed. The paramilitary commander also told Human Rights Watch that government-allied commanders were facing serious difficulties in keeping their men under control. Drugs are being sold and used openly within the base, making many soldiers threateningly volatile.     The five men are believed to have been part of a larger group of 55 RUF allegedly ex-combatants who were arrested by pro-government paramilitia groups at Calaba town that same day (May 8). Many of the detained ex-combatants were allegedly carrying identification cards showing they had completed a demobilization program. The fate of the other detained men is unknown. Human Rights Watch warned that government-condoned attacks on former RUF combatants who completed rehabilitation programs is not only a war crime but could also lead many former RUF fighters to return to active fighting.     """"Tensions are running high in Sierra Leone, especially against the RUF which has been responsible for terrible abuses in the past,"""" said Takirambudde. """"It is at this crucial time that the authorities in Sierra Leone need to stand up for the rule of law, and prevent their soldiers from going on a witch-hunt against RUF suspects and demobilized fighters.""""     The laws of war specifically prohibit the mistreatment, torture, mutilation or execution of captured combatants.

Extensive evidence has been compiled, by Human Rights Watch and others, of crimes against humanity committed by soldiers and officers of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), of which Foday Sankoh is the leader. But that evidence should be carefully compiled and presented in a court of law. Sankoh should be informed of the specific charges against him as soon as possible, according to fair trial standards.     """"Foday Sankoh must not be subjected to mob rule,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.

Takirambudde noted that the international community, including the United Nations, never recognized the amnesty and is not bound by its terms. Human Rights Watch has also documented many abuses committed by the RUF since July 1999  which are not covered by the amnesty.     """"At the core of the crisis in Sierra Leone is the question of impunity,"""" said Takirambudde.

The first major human rights trial in Aceh ended today with guilty verdicts against 24 soldiers and one civilian implicated in the killings of Teungku Bantaqiah - a Muslim cleric and teacher - and over fifty of his students and followers in July 1999. The two organizations welcomed Indonesian government efforts to hold members of the security forces accountable for the atrocity, but expressed serious misgivings about the trial process and the absence of military commanders among the defendants. """"The trial shows the Indonesian government's resolve to put an end to military impunity in Aceh and this is an important step forward,"""" the organizations said. """"But it is a seriously flawed beginning. Commanding officers were not charged and key witnesses failed to appear. Future human rights trials must address those weaknesses."""" The organizations emphasized the government's failure to prosecute commanding officers. Of the 24 members of the military on trial, none was above the rank of captain and the majority were privates or non-commissioned officers. The evidence that was presented at trial told a grisly tale of an attack on a religious compound which left 34 dead and the subsequent premeditated execution of 23 students who had been injured in the initial raid. Soldiers testified that they had been ordered by their commanding officer to """"school"""" the youth, a term the soldiers said was used by local commanders as a euphemism for killing a detainee. The commanding officer in question, Lt. Colonel Sudjono, originally named as a key suspect in the massacre, has been missing for several months and was not present at the trial. Another officer, Lieutenant Colonel Syafnil Armen, who appeared as a witness and admitted to having ordered troops to bring back Teungku Bantaqiah, dead or alive, was not charged. The Indonesian military had accused Bantaqiah of supporting the Acehnese armed separatist movement. Prison sentences of between eight-and-a-half and ten years were handed down to the 25 defendants. """"If the justice effort in Aceh is to be credible, the most senior culpable officers must be brought to justice,"""" the international rights groups said. """"The exclusive focus on junior ranks weakened the legitimacy of the trial among Acehnese observers and among observers elsewhere in Indonesia. It suggests that the government is still unwilling or unable to take decisive action against higher level military leaders. To the extent this presents a foretaste of what the East Timor trials will look like, it does not bode well."""" Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also emphasized that key eyewitnesses to the massacre did not give testimony during the trial. Lt. Colonel Sudjono, as mentioned above, mysteriously disappeared and did not testify. Members of Teungku Bantaqiah's family refused to appear as witnesses, apparently because of misgivings about the way the trial was being conducted and because of fears for their security. The younger of Teungku Bantaqiah's two wives, who claimed to have witnessed the attack, was reported in the local media on 30 April 2000 as saying that she wanted to testify but had not been summoned. After making this statement, she reportedly received threats and fled Aceh seeking protection.  The international rights groups recommended that a witness protection and support program be implemented immediately in Indonesia, and called for any such program to include protections for witnesses before, during, and after the trial, for so long as threats to security remain. Although past trials in Indonesia have often been marred by reports of intimidation and harassment of witnesses, there is currently no witness protection program in the country. """"In Aceh, where the security forces have a powerful presence and a long record of literally getting away with murder, the potential for intimidation is particularly high,"""" the organizations concluded. """"Donors and other countries committed to assisting the justice effort in Indonesia should provide funds and expertise to help institute such a program. Such protections will be critical in the future not only for trials in Aceh, but also for the East Timor prosecutions and all other cases in which the defendants come from military and police ranks.""""  """"The level of trust by the people of Aceh in the government is already low,"""" the statement concluded. """"If the Acehnese believe that the trials are no more than an exercise in public relations, how can they be expected to place their trust in governmented efforts to solve the problems in the province?"""" Background Twenty-four years ago, a small group of Acehnese declared independence from Indonesia and have been fighting for a separate state ever since. Although armed opposition groups have grown stronger over the past year as exiles returned from abroad and popular support swelled, they have never been particularly respectful of other people's rights and are by no means universally well-liked in Aceh. The situation in Aceh has become far more complex than a simple insurgency, as a broad-based coalition of students, clerics, intellectuals, civil servants, and entrepreneurs — though opposed to the violent methods of the armed opposition group — have become outraged at the government's failure to put an end to the military's dismal record of abuses in the province and now share the insurgents' anti-Jakarta sentiment. The Bantaqiah massacre, as it has come to be known, is just one of hundreds of cases of alleged abuses against civilians resulting from a decade of counter-insurgency operations in the province. In 1989, guerrillas using weapons acquired largely from raids on military posts within Aceh carried out a series of attacks on soldiers and non-Acehnese migrants to the region. In ensuing years, the Indonesian army responded with ferocious and indiscriminate force, killing more than a thousand civilians, often leaving their mutilated bodies by the side of roads or rivers. Many more were arrested, tortured, and arbitrarily detained for months, sometimes years. Hundreds of men """"disappeared"""". Many women whose husbands or sons were suspected of involvement with the armed opposition were raped.  Although Aceh's status as a military operational area (DOM) was lifted in August 1998, just three months after Soeharto was forced to step down, intensive counter-insurgency efforts continued and new atrocities have continued to come to light, fueling separatist sentiment in Aceh. An accord was signed on 12 May 2000 in Geneva between the government and rebels which provides for a three-month cease-fire to allow for further efforts towards building peace in the province.  The Bantaqiah trial, the most significant justice effort to date, is the first of five planned trials in Aceh. In their statement, the two rights groups called on the Indonesian government to follow the Bantaqiah and the other planned trials with a comprehensive effort to bring perpetrators to justice. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch noted that the success of the peace initiative could well be affected by the seriousness of the justice effort.","Asia, Indonesia",""

But the international rights group also welcomed steps the new administration of Abdurrahman Wahid has taken toward respecting basic rights in the province.  """"President Wahid government has taken a fresh approach and made a long-overdue commitment to respecting basic rights in Papua, but the reality still does not match the rhetoric,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"Protesters, including some of Papua's leading citizens, continue to be targeted for organizing peaceful rallies."""" In a new 38-page report, """"Human Rights and Pro-Independence Actions in Papua, 1999-2000,"""" Human Rights Watch details the eruption of independence demands in the province following Soeharto's forced resignation in May 1998, and documents the inconsistent and at times repressive government response. (President Abdurrahman Wahid renamed the province """"Papua"""" in a visit on January 1, 2000, in deference to the wishes of the indigenous population of the island, but the Indonesian parliament has yet to officially endorse the name change.)  The report in particular credits Wahid, who took office in October 1999, with releasing political prisoners and announcing that peaceful political expression, including expression of pro-independence views, would no longer be treated as a criminal offense. Wahid has also stated unambiguously that the Indonesian government would not recognize Papuan demands for independence. Papua, Indonesia's largest province, comprising more than one-fifth of the country's total land area, was first put under Indonesian control in 1963. It was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 in a still-controversial U.N.-approved process. For many years, the province was categorized as a military combat zone and under an effective state of martial law, ostensibly because of the threat posed by the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka or OPM), an armed group engaged in a generally low-level guerrilla campaign for independence. At the same time, many Papuans sought to express their support for independence through peaceful means, notably the symbolic public raising of the """"Morning Star"""" flag which had first flown openly when local people sought to free the territory from Dutch colonial rule in 1961.  Under Soeharto, such flag-raising ceremonies and other pro-independence manifestations were ruthlessly suppressed. Demonstrators were forcibly dispersed and assaulted, and leading activists were subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention. Such activists frequently were prosecuted and imprisoned under harsh laws dealing with subversion and rebellion, as well as the notorious """"hate sowing"""" articles of the Indonesian penal code.  Indigenous Papuans, who are Melanesians and darker-skinned than the numerically and politically dominant Javanese and members of most other ethnic groups in Indonesia, were also subject to ethnic and racial discrimination. While Indonesian rule brought unprecedented economic development, it also resulted in an influx of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia and caused resentment among Papuans as the benefits went disproportionately to foreign investors and these immigrants. When Soeharto was forced from power in May 1998, many of these long repressed sentiments could be made public for the first time.  The strength of pro-independence sentiment was unmistakable as early as February 1999, when 100 Papuan leaders met with then-President Habibie to initiate what was being hailed as a """"National Dialogue"""" on Papuan concerns. But the leaders presented President Habibie with a single demand: independence. This clearly shocked and displeased the Habibie government, which had encouraged the National Dialogue up to then, and the process was soon suspended. In April 1999, the government reverted to the methods used during the Soeharto era, attempting to round up independence supporters and censor discussion of the subject. The crackdown included bans on expression, assembly, and association, arbitrary arrests, and widespread intimidation of independence supporters. Since his election, President Abdurrahman Wahid has initiated a number of reforms. Openly acknowledging the errors of the past, the new administration released political prisoners, and moved quickly to allow greater freedom, including open expression of pro-independence views. In practice, however, the government has been inconsistent. While it has permitted a number of peaceful demonstrations, other such rallies have been forcibly dispersed by police with resulting injuries to demonstrators. Likewise, even as Indonesia's Minister for Law and Legislation announced on December 13, 1999 that all Papuan political prisoners would be released, five men involved in a peaceful flag-raising which had taken place in the town Genyem on July 1, 1999, were charged with rebellion by a state prosecutor in Jayapura. Although those charges eventually were dropped, authorities are now investigating a series of peaceful flag-raising ceremonies held throughout the province on December 1, 1999 and nine people already have been named as suspects.","Asia, Indonesia",""

""""We're glad that the court is going to take the time to carefully study the law, because under the law Senegal is obliged to bring Habre to justice,"""" said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations which initiated this case. """"We're confident that we're going to win."""" Lawyers for Habre and for the victims who brought the case, as well as the state prosecutor, presented arguments behind closed doors to Dakar's three-judge Indicting Chamber on Habre's request to dismiss the case. The victims' lawyers, led by Boucounta Diallo, noted that the """"no safe haven"""" provision of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, expressly obliges states to either prosecute or extradite alleged torturers who enter its territory. Under the Senegalese constitution, international treaties, once ratified, override Senegal's legal code. The Torture Convention was the basis for Britain's detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet for crimes committed in Chile. Habre's lawyers argued that Senegal has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Chad and that the prosecution is barred by the statute of limitations. The victims' lawyers also stressed that according to Senegalese law, the 10-year statute of limitations for serious crimes only began when prosecution became possible after Habre fell from power in December 1990. The case was initiated in Dakar in January 2000, less than 10 years later. """"Today you can't commit atrocities in one country and then claim sanctuary next door,"""" said Brody. Local groups expressed disappointment that the state prosecutor had taken Habre's side in today's debate but stressed that Senegal's international credibility was at stake. """"Today, we reminded the judges that by ratifying the Torture Convention, Senegal promised that it would not be a refuge for torturers,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"That's a promise that I am sure the judges will take seriously."""" In February, Judge Demba Kandji of the Dakar Regional Court indicted Habre on torture charges, and placed him under house arrest. On Monday, Judge Kandji, whose investigation is continuing, heard the testimony from Mahamat Hassan Abakar, the president of Chad's truth commission, which spent 15 months probing Habre's crimes. The commission, which interviewed 1,726 witnesses, estimated that Habre's forces killed 40,000 Chadians. The court also heard from three former detainees who were mistreated in Habre's jails. Antoine Kenoue Tchoungre told Judge Kandji that in December 1987 he was subjected to electric shock torture while Habre looked on. The victims also announced that 53 Chadian victims had joined the original seven plaintiffs in the action against Habre. In addition, one Frenchwoman whose Chadian husband was killed by Habre's regime as well as the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), which represents 792 victims of Habre's brutality, are represented in the case. Habre, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habre's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habre was deposed in December 1990 and has lived in Senegal since.","Africa, Chad, Senegal",""

Jesse Jackson President and Founder Rainbow Coalition Chicago, IL   Dear Rev. Jackson:   We are writing to you as President Clinton's Special Envoy for Democracy in Africa on the urgent matter of the crisis in Sierra Leone. Horrendous human rights abuses against civilians have characterized this conflict, and the current crisis demands a strategy to protect the civilian population. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to put the issue of protection of civilians in Sierra Leone on the forefront of your agenda and to ensure that the U.S. government makes a forceful and public stand on this issue. This includes actively providing support to countries that are willing to send their troops to Sierra Leone for that explicit purpose.   In particular, we urge you to call for a new, augmented force to replace UNAMSIL, the United Nations operation in Sierra Leone, in order to make a coordinated effort to defend Sierra Leonean civilians. There is a dire need for a new authority capable of co-ordinating the growing U.N. and non-U.N. efforts, one with a clear mandate and capability to quickly address the grave threats to the civilian population. The augmented force should adopt a policy of """"zero tolerance"""" toward human rights abuse, including abuses committed by its own troops. Human Rights Watch has documented serious abuses on the part of all parties to the conflict in Sierra Leone, including some of those now fighting on the government side. In addition, international forces must have the ability to deploy throughout the country. While ensuring the security of civilians in Freetown may be the priority of the moment, the goal must be a widening circle of protection for civilians.   It is clear that the misguided 1999 Lomé accord, which provided a blanket amnesty for grave human rights abuses in Sierra Leone, has unraveled. The amnesty offered under the Lomé accord has been an utter failure, signaling to rebels who committed horrible abuses that they would not be held accountable for their crimes. There should be no effort to revive or give credence to any such amnesty in the future. Instead, the U.S. should now work with the U.N. to take steps to establish mechanisms for the investigation of gross human rights violations with a view to the eventual apprehension and prosecution of those found responsible. The U.S. should be working to ensure the deployment of United Nations human rights monitors in Sierra Leone to provide better information on atrocities that may be taking place outside Freetown. Collecting this evidence is a key first step toward holding perpetrators accountable, and, with time, deterring further atrocities.   The crisis in Sierra Leone cannot be solved without addressing the question of weapons supply for the rebels. We therefore urge you to focus on the need to tighten the United Nations arms embargo on Sierra Leonean rebels. There have been numerous reports of weapons shipments to the RUF over the past year, in violation of a U.N. arms embargo that has been in place since 1997. Illicit arms deliveries to the rebels reportedly have been possible with help from neighboring Liberia, which is also subject to an arms embargo, and Burkina Faso. The reported role played by Liberia in supporting the rebels demands that the U.S. be extremely wary of using President Charles Taylor as an intermediary in this conflict.   The Clinton Administration has often been reluctant to use effective and forceful public diplomacy to highlight human rights issues in Africa, which has fed misperceptions about U.S. policy. It is therefore critical that your mission to West Africa use every opportunity to ensure that the U.S. clearly weighs in on the side of protecting civilians from further atrocities in Sierra Leone.   Thank you for your attention to these important matters. We look forward to meeting with you upon your return.

In a briefing paper released today, the New York-based international monitoring group identified persistent reports that the RUF has flouted a U.N. arms embargo that has been in place since 1997, reportedly with help from neighboring Liberia, which is also subject to an arms embargo, and Burkina Faso.     """"The crisis in Sierra Leone can't be solved without addressing the question of weapons supply for the rebels,"""" said Lisa Misol of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"With peace unraveling in Sierra Leone, rebels can be expected to activate their arms supply channels unless the U.N. takes firm steps to stop them.""""     Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. Security Council to authorize U.N. forces to monitor Sierra Leone's borders (especially the Liberian border), roads, and airstrips in rebel-controlled areas and to halt any weapons shipments they detect.   Human Rights Watch also urged the Security Council to order an official inquiry into illegal arms flows to the RUF rebels, including the role of the trade in diamonds from rebel-held areas in Sierra Leone, in order to identify the illicit channels of supply, expose embargo violators, and devise strategies to halt these flows. Such an effort should draw on prior U.N. experience, including a recent U.N. investigation that exposed sanctions-busting in Angola.","Africa, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Arms, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/05/15/eastern-congo-ravaged","Eastern Congo Ravaged","Eastern Congo Ravaged","","05/15/2000","The Rwandan army and its Congolese allies have massacred and raped civilians in eastern Congo, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Their opponents, Hutu and Mai Mai armed groups, are also committing atrocities against the civilian population. The rebel Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie (RCD), which is based in Goma, controls parts of eastern Congo in defiance of the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The RCD is crucially supplied and supported by the Rwandan government.  """"The United Nations is looking for ways to prop up the 1999 Congo peace accord,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. """"But one thing must be clear—the human rights situation in Eastern Congo is disastrous. And civilians are bearing the brunt of the fighting.""""  During a visit to the areas controlled by the RCD and the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), Human Rights Watch interviewed survivors of the massacres, as well as rape victims. It found, for example, that on February 5, 2000, RCD and RPA troops attacked civilians in the village of Kilambo in North Kivu. Soldiers tied up men, raped their wives in front of them, and then killed them. Human Rights Watch has the names of thirty victims. The massacre took place in revenge for earlier attacks by Hutu armed groups.  Human Rights Watch also found evidence supporting reports by a local rights group, Heritiers de la Justice, that RCD soldiers sexually tortured and buried alive several women in Mwenga, an incident the RCD vehemently denies. Two women from Mwenga, a town in South Kivu, described to Human Rights Watch how soldiers stripped and raped five women. They also put hot pepper in the women's vaginas, then placed the women in several holes that were dug in the ground filled with salt water.  Mai Mai and predominantly Hutu armed groups are also committing widespread human rights abuses. They regularly attack villages, force people to hand over their belongings and kill them if they refuse to do so. Hutu armed groups in particular use rape as a weapon of war. Women are often gang-raped by groups of ten or more, or are taken as sexual slaves. One woman from South Kivu told Human Rights Watch how she begged members of a Hutu armed group to spare her. One let her go, but the next one broke her resistance by threatening to kill her child. He then raped her in front of her child and left her injured. The justice system has broken down under RCD rule. Soldiers and the police act with impunity and the judicial authorities are reluctant to act on criminal complaints, particularly when crimes involve RCD or Rwandan soldiers. After having registered a complaint against a soldier who had committed armed robbery against him, Sebastien Balolebwami was attacked by soldiers and shot dead on February 10, 2000. Detainees are often held for weeks without charge, and are tortured in detention centers such as the infamous """"Chien Mechant"""" (Vicious Dog) or """"Bureau II"""" detention centers.  Human Rights Watch urged that the judicial system in Eastern Congo which has ceased to function be restored. The organization also called upon the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to add another chamber, to deal with the war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Human rights groups, church organizations and other members of civil society are regularly threatened, followed, arrested and beaten by RCD authorities, who brand any oppositional activity as """"ethnic incitement."""" Despite the repression, some civil society groups continue to speak out. On International Women's Day, 8 March 2000, women's rights groups organized a day of grieving for their killed husbands and relatives. A women's activist, Zita Kavungirwa, was summoned and threatened, and another one, Marie-Jeanne Mbachu, was suspended from her job after the RCD pressured her employer.  Bruno Bahati, a leading member of the Coordination of Civil Society in South Kivu, was arrested by Rwandese security forces on April 22, 2000 on the Rwandan-Ugandan border. He is currently detained in Kigali and is accused of carrying newspapers from Kinshasa with him. In February 2000, Bukavu's Archbishop Emmanuel Kataliko was declared persona non grata by the authorities and sent to his home village outside the RCD-Goma area. The RCD accuses him of fomenting ethnic hatred after he criticized the authorities in his Christmas prayer.  The local Congolese population considers the Rwandan military, which is dominated by ethnic Tutsi, to be foreign occupiers. Their resentment often extends to all Rwandan and Congolese Tutsi. Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the existence of anti-Tutsi pamphlets circulating in eastern Congo, and warned that the abusive tactics of the RCD and RPA were inflaming ethnic hatreds and entrenching the conflict.  Human Rights Watch also called upon the U.N. to ensure that the field office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Eastern Congo has adequate resources to function effectively, as well as to ensure that the U.N. peace-keeping operation has a strong human rights component.

On 10 May 2000, the Acting Council of the Palestinian Bar Association removed at least nine human rights lawyers associated with human rights organizations in the Palestinian Autonomous Areas from its list of practicing lawyers. The lawyers include well-known human rights lawyer Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) -- an affiliate of the International Commission of Jurists and FIDH -- as well as other PCHR lawyers Iyad Alami, Hanan Matar, Ashraf Nasralla, Ibrahim Sourani, and Fouad Tarazi. Lawyer Hanan al Bakri of the Women's Legal and Social Counselling Center, was removed as well. They all received notices dated 9 May 2000, which were not signed, but only stamped with the logo of the Bar Association. The Council claims to have based its action on Article 7 of the Palestinian Bar Association Law, which prohibits, inter alia, lawyers from combining the practice of law with the holding of public or private employment, whether for salary or reward.  We are concerned by this narrow and restrictive interpretation of the law which effectively prevents lawyers associated with human rights groups from pleading before courts. This action significantly limits the capacity of these groups to provide legal assistance. We are further concerned that the lawyers were not given the chance to have their point of view heard, in accordance with due process, before such a drastic measure was taken. Principle 23 of the 1990 UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers states:  """"Lawyers like other citizens are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. In particular, they shall have the right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights and to join or form local, national or international organisation and attend their meetings, without suffering professional restrictions by reason of their lawful action or their membership in a lawful organisation. In exercising these rights, lawyers shall always conduct themselves in accordance with the law and the recognised standards and ethics of the legal profession.""""  It is fully consistent with this provision that lawyers should be free to form or join human rights groups. As the principles state, lawyers should not suffer professional restrictions for exercising this fundamental right.  We are disturbed that the Acting Council of the Bar took these steps against PCHR lawyers only a few days after PCHR obtained on 29 April 2000, a ruling from the Palestinian High Court of Justice to suspend an administrative decision of the Chief of Police. This decision prohibited the holding of public meetings without his prior approval. We fear that the Acting Bar Council's move against these lawyers was politically motivated to prevent them from carrying out their professional activities. Our fear is supported by the fact that this measure appears to be selectively applied.  The Acting Bar Council was appointed by President Arafat as an interim measure to prepare for bar elections by 9 May 2000. It took this iniquitous measure in its last day in office. The bar elections are yet to take place.  We call on the Council to rescind its decision.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

It urged, however, that the cease-fire agreement be followed by a peace process in which justice and protection of civilians are top priorities. It also called on the Indonesian government to involve leaders of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civilian groups in efforts to implement the cease-fire. Civilian groups have played a major role in pushing for a negotiated end to the armed conflict in Aceh,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"But they are not directly represented at the talks and their participation and support is going to be needed if any agreement is to last. The peace effort should also include guarantees that the rights of Acehnese civilians will be fully protected by all parties.""""  A representative of the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM), Zaini Abdullah, and the Indonesian Ambassador to Switzerland, Hasan Wirayuda, are scheduled to meet at the Henry Dunant Center in Geneva later today. Representatives of the rebels and government have met previously, most recently in mid-April, but the parties have announced that they are close to signing a Memorandum of Understanding that will provide for the first formal cease-fire in the twenty-three-year-old conflict. Early reports suggested that the parties would be agreeing to a three-month cease-fire to begin fifteen days after the signing of the memorandum.  """"Once an agreement is signed, a first priority should be finding ways to guarantee the safety of displaced villagers, aid workers, and other civilians who have increasingly been targets of violence,"""" said Saunders. """"Another critical issue is addressing Acehnese anger over the systematic military abuses that have plagued the province for more than a decade. The government should launch a comprehensive justice effort.""""  The current rebel movement in Aceh began more than two decades ago, but recent months have witnessed a significant intensification of the fighting. Civilians have increasingly borne the brunt of the violence, with local Acehnese groups claiming that fifty or more noncombatants have been killed each month this year. Human Rights Watch also urged Indonesia's donors to insist that military abuses are fully investigated and prosecuted, and to strictly condition any military assistance programs on concrete progress in ending abuses in Aceh and bringing those responsible to justice.  The Indonesian government has acknowledged past mistakes in the province, but has not made a concerted effort to address simmering demands for justice. The most significant justice effort to date has been a major human rights trial currently underway in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, before a special tribunal that includes both military and civilian judges. The defendants include over twenty soldiers involved in an attack last July on an Islamic boarding school. The followers of the charismatic religious leader there, Teungku Bantaqiah, were mowed down by bullets as were the Teungku and his wife. Over fifty bodies have been recovered from the site. Not a single soldier was wounded, suggesting the followers were unarmed, and reportedly only four weapons were found in the school.  On Tuesday, May 9, in the most recent court session of the Bantaqiah trial, a series of soldiers testified that they summarily executed twenty-six students who had been apprehended during the attack on the school. The soldiers testified that they had been ordered by their commanding officer to """"school"""" the youth, a term the soldiers said is used by local commanders as a euphemism for killing a detainee. The commanding officer in question, Lt. Colonel Sudjono, originally named as a key suspect in the massacre, has been missing for several months and is not present at the trial. He is either in hiding or is a victim of foul play himself. Despite the damning revelations, the trial is thus focusing only on twenty-five lower-ranking defendants. And without Sudjono's testimony, it is unlikely that the trial will produce significant evidence on the chain of command involved in the decision to open fire.  """"Many civilian leaders have been opposed to the violent methods of the rebels but are outraged at the government's failure to put an end to the military's dismal record of abuses in the province,"""" said Saunders. """"And the anger is only building as more details of past atrocities come to light. The new agreement offers a window of opportunity.""""  Details on the effects of the conflict on civilians, along with recommendations from Human Rights Watch, are set forth in a new """"Press Backgrounder."""" The document is available on the Human Rights Watch website (https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/05/aceh05-back.htm).  Background Since early February 2000, Indonesian security forces have mounted Operation Sadar Rencong III in Aceh, a counterinsurgency operation reportedly designed to find and arrest some 800 rebels. The operation follows a spate of killings of security forces in ambushes. Police officials report that, from July to December 1999 alone, 53 police were killed and many more were injured in such attacks. Counterinsurgency operations, however, have relied heavily on roadblocks and brutal house-to-house searches often accompanied by indiscriminate violence against unarmed civilians. Hundreds have been killed. Activists and local humanitarian aid workers, whom many soldiers see as siding with the rebels, have been directly targeted.  One particularly disturbing aspect of the conflict has been the increasing frequency of """"mysterious shootings"""" and assassinations by unknown third parties. Although a few such acts may be the work of local thugs settling local scores, most appear to have a political objective, and rumors abound that most of the recent killings are the work of rogue soldiers or former soldiers seeking to destabilize the situation. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has conceded that former soldiers are to blame for much of the violence but has said that security forces have so far been unable to apprehend the suspects.","Asia, Indonesia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/05/11/peru-presidential-runoff-election","Peru- Presidential Runoff Election","Peru: Presidential Runoff Election","HRW Letter","05/11/2000","Dr. César Gaviria Secretary General Organization of American States 17th and Constitution Avenue, Office 6 Washington, DC 20006   Dear Ambassador Gaviria, I write to express Human Rights Watch's grave concern at the failure of the government of President Alberto Fujimori to take the steps considered essential by Peruvian election monitoring groups and by the international community to ensure the fairness and credibility of the second round of Peru's presidential election. Although a month has passed since the widely questioned April 9 poll, President Fujimori has yet to take any significant action to comply with the recommendations of national and international observers, including the Electoral Observation Mission of the OAS and the National Democratic Institute/Carter Center. Moreover, negotiations between the parties contesting the elections to establish fair rules for the second round have run into severe difficulties due to the refusal of the coalition backing Fujimori's candidacy to accept more than cosmetic changes.   Since the official electoral body, the Jurado Nacional de Elecciones (JNE) has now fixed the date for the presidential run-off for May 28, time is rapidly running out for the Peruvian government to rescue the credibility of the electoral process before it is too late. An election held without reforms to ensure basic conditions of fairness and a competent and impartial vote-counting process would entirely lack validity. As the National Democratic Institute/Carter Center pre-electoral delegation reported in their May 5 statement: """"Unless immediate and comprehensive improvements are made to the political environment surrounding the presidential runoff election, as well as to administrative and technical procedures required for election day and the consolidation of results, Peru's election process will ultimately fail to meet minimum international standards for democratic elections.""""  We believe that the OAS should set a deadline for the implementation of its recommendations, and announce its intention to convene an emergency meeting of member states under General Assembly Resolution 1080, to discuss measures to be taken if this deadline is not met. Evidence of gross incompetence and still uninvestigated claims of fraud by the main vote-counting body, the Oficina Nacional de Procesos Electorales (ONPE), have continued to accumulate since the April 9 vote, and have been documented in detail by Peruvian nongovernmental monitoring groups and the national press. The delays in the transfer of the votes from polling centers to the ONPE's counting centers, the instability and breakdowns of the computing system, as well as its alleged vulnerability to outside manipulation, were all widely commented on during and following the vote. The ONPE's loss of credibility prior to the elections was compounded by its failure -despite OAS insistence- to promptly investigate allegations of the forgery of signatures for the registration of the pro-Fujimori electoral alliance Peru 2000, in which ONPE officials were alleged to have been involved. The JNE and the special prosecutor, Mirtha Trabucco Cerna, have failed to publish the results of their investigations into these serious allegations, and the prosecutor has now announced a 30-day extension of her investigation, so that the results are unlikely to be known before the May 28 election.  More than one thousand irregularities documented by the nongovernmental observer group Transparencia, and the Peoples Defender before and during the April 9 vote remain to be investigated. Many of these reports concerned the improper use of state resources or the involvement of public officials in campaigning activities on behalf of President Fujimori's candidacy. Moreover, the ONPE has still given no satisfactory explanation of the fact that the number of votes recorded in the elections exceeded by more than one million the number of registered voters. These unclarified irregularities inevitably cast a deep shadow over the credibility of the institutions charged with supervising the second round.  Government officials have downplayed the seriousness of the deficiencies in ONPE. The recent formation of working groups, including opposition party members as well as representatives of the Defensoria del Pueblo and the OAS observation mission, which are tasked with remedying the worst defects of the computing system, and the training of polling officials and party poll watchers, are not sufficient to restore confidence in the election institutions. By itself, the formation of these task groups does not mean that the ONPE is now competent and impartial enough to compute the May 28 results accurately and fairly. Under these circumstances, we believe it is essential that the OAS obtain authorization, access, and facilities, to directly supervise the vote-counting process.  Another grave defect in the conditions prior to the April 9 vote was the opposition candidates' lack of access to the mass media, especially television, and the extremely biased and vituperative television coverage of the campaign. Since the April 9 vote, opposition efforts to obtain fair television coverage for their candidate's electoral campaign in the weeks leading up to the May 28 run-off have been singularly unsuccessful.  As the OAS election observation mission and other international observers such as the NDI/Carter Center noted during the April 9 campaign, free-access television coverage of the campaigns of President Fujimori's opponents was almost non-existent, and what there was slanted and denigratory. This could be seen most clearly on the final day of the campaign when president's closing rally was being transmitted simultaneously by all seven free-access television channels, but those of opposition candidates did not appear at all. A reporter for a major United States cable network told Human Rights Watch that police barred her and other international reporters from attending a Toledo rally held at the Sheraton hotel. Only one television station carried live the official results announcing a second round. The government's control of the output of the major open television channels has been achieved by a combination of board-room intervention and financial inducement provided by massive public advertising. The effects before, during, and following the April 9 elections amounted, in the words of the chief of the OAS observation mission, Eduardo Stein, to an """"information blackout,"""" (cerco informativo) depriving Peruvians of the knowledge they needed to make an informed choice. Government officials subsequently called on private Peruvian television stations to provide time at reasonable rates for opposition electoral broadcasts, but they have categorically rejected imposing regulatory provisions to ensure reasonable air-time to the opposition contender. Under present conditions a voluntary agreement is very unlikely to bring results, since there appears to be no interest or will on the part of television owners to provide an impartial public service. In a recent editorial, a leading member of the Association of Radio and Television of Peru, Daniel Linares Bazán, described Toledo's campaign as a """"methodology of social agitation,"""" and as part of an obscure conspiracy backed by unnamed international lobbies interfering in Peruvian affairs. Although according to recent surveys the vast majority of Peruvians want more balanced coverage of the issues, election broadcasting continues to be highly unequal and slanted. Except for channels 8 and 11, access for the opposition party Peru Posible to private stations has been either prohibitively expensive, denied outright, or coverage is hostile and misleading. Effectively, therefore, the opposition candidate is denied airtime to reply to the numerous personal attacks leveled against him on prime time programs, such as the accusation made recently on Channel 2 that Mr Toledo was """"violent, a liar and a provocator"""" (violento, mentiroso y provocador). Recent negotiations between representatives of Peru 2000 and Peru Posible to discuss reforms to level the playing field in the May 28 run-off have failed to bring any improvements on the question of television access and coverage. An example of continuing bias was the failure of the free access channels, including the state-owned Channel 7, to cover the well-attended electoral rally held by Toledo on May 3 in Arequipa. Peru Posible's disillusionment with this lack of progress on media access caused it to break off the negotiations on May 4. Mr. Secretary General, the persistence and professionalism of the Electoral Observation Mission headed by Amb. Eduardo Stein deserve recognition and congratulation from democrats throughout the continent. The mission has done much to bring the gravity of the problems described in this letter to world attention, and to seek practical solutions so that the will of the Peruvian people can be respected in the forthcoming elections. In order for the Mission to be successful, however, firm pressure is needed from the OAS member states. I would urge you to set the government of Peru a deadline with which to comply with the mission's recommendations.  I would also urge that you announce in advance your intention to convene an Ad-Hoc Meeting of OAS foreign ministers under General Assembly Resolution 1080 in the event that Peru fails to meet that deadline. The """"Santiago Commitment to Democracy and the Renewal of the Inter-American System"""" – Resolution 1080 – provides for an emergency meeting of the OAS foreign ministers to decide upon specific collective action when democracy is threatened. In its preamble, Resolution 1080 exhorts member states of the OAS to make operative the principle enshrined in the Charter that """" the solidarity of the American states and the high aims which it pursues require the political organization of those states to be based on effective exercise of representative democracy."""" It is essential that the OAS member states honor this commitment to the hemispheric protection of democracy. They should show their resolve now to persuade the government of President Fujimori to introduce immediately the reforms necessary to permit free and fair elections in Peru. Thank you for your attention to these important matters. I look forward to opportunities to discuss these and other human rights issues with you in the future.  José Miguel Vivanco cc: Amb.

In an open letter to Kofi Annan released today, it urged the U.N. Secretary-General to ensure that members states grant the international forces in Sierra Leone the means and capability to do the job.      The U.N. forces in Sierra Leone are now being joined by British forces, as well as the local Sierra Leonean army, Civil Defense Forces, and former rebels now loyal to the government. West African peacekeepers may also join the effort. Other governments with the necessary military capacity have so far offered only logistic support in response to U.N. appeals.     Human Rights Watch stressed the need for a new authority capable of co-ordinating the growing U.N. and non-U.N. efforts, one with a clear mandate and capability to quickly address the grave threats to the civilian population. The augmented force should adopt a policy of """"zero tolerance"""" toward human rights abuse, including abuse committed by its own troops. Human Rights Watch has documented serious abuses on the part of all parties to the conflict in Sierra Leone including some of those now fighting on the government side.     Recent reports have suggested that suspected members of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have been summarily executed in Freetown in recent days. Human Rights Watch urged that the rights of captured combatants and suspected rebels be respected.     Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision of the British government to send military forces to Sierra Leone and noted reports that U.K. forces were engaged in activities beyond the evacuation of their own nationals. Human Rights Watch urged other countries to follow suit. Other governments with the necessary military capacity have so far offered only logistic support in response to U.N. appeals.     """"Sierra Leone clearly needs more help from the international community,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"But it's not necessarily a question of greater lethal force. Sierra Leone needs defenders with the ability, the authority, and the paramount duty to protect the civilians who have borne the brunt of this terrible war.""""     Human Rights Watch urged that international forces needed to have the ability to deploy throughout the country. While ensuring the security of civilians in Freetown may be the priority of the moment, the goal must be a widening circle of protection for civilians. The international community has the duty to ensure that the defenders are given the capabilities needed to meet these responsibilities.     The United Nations should also endeavor to deploy human rights monitors in Sierra Leone to provide better information on atrocities that may be taking place outside Freetown, Human Rights Watch said.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Need for a New Peacekeeping Authority in Sierra Leone","","05/11/2000","Dear Mr. Secretary-General,   The current crisis in Sierra Leone, in which Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels have clashed with U.N. peacekeepers, taking hundreds hostage, suggests that the fragile Lomé peace accord of July 1999, so often violated by the RUF, has now fully unraveled. Although the focus of current media attention is the abduction of U.N. peacekeepers, civilians will once again bear the brunt of RUF atrocities if the crisis leads to international paralysis.   It is time for the international community to recognize that the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), hampered by a lack of commitment from member states, has failed. The United Nations must now take firm steps to protect the civilians who are at grave risk.   To avert further tragedy in Sierra Leone, Human Rights Watch calls on you to urgently:  press U.N. member states, especially those with the necessary troops and resources, to help protect civilians in Sierra Leone by deploying forces with this explicit mandate, together with the necessary logistical and material support; assist in the creation of a unified authority to oversee all international forces operating in Sierra Leone, as well as local forces loyal to the government of Sierra Leone, and ask the Security Council to give these unified forces a clear mandate to undertake essential tasks, including deployment throughout the country as quickly as possible to protect civilians in vulnerable areas and recognizing that the security of Freetown is essential to any such effort; insist that all forces unified under the new authority show zero tolerance toward human rights abuses, not only by rebel forces, but also by soldiers within its own ranks, including pro-government forces that have been responsible for serious human rights abuses in the past, and seek Security Council endorsement of this policy; deploy human rights monitors throughout the country as quickly as possible to collect evidence of abuse as a first step toward bringing those responsible to justice and, with time, deterring further atrocities.

On Thursday, May 11, Dakar's three-judge Indicting Chamber will hear a request from Habre's lawyers to dismiss the prosecution on the ground that Senegal has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Chad. The groups noted, however, that the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1987, obliges states to either prosecute or extradite alleged torturers who enter its territory. This Convention was the basis for Britain's detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet for crimes committed in Chile. Under the Senegalese constitution, this treaty directly becomes part of Senegalese law. """"The Torture Convention was adopted in order to deny a ‘safe haven' to those who commit this heinous crime,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations which initiated the criminal action. """"Habre's theory would turn Senegal's ratification of this key treaty into an empty gesture with no real effect."""" Habre's lawyers also seek dismissal because prosecution is barred by the statute of limitations and because Senegal did not adopt national legislation incorporating the Convention against Torture until 1996. Brody noted, however, that neither of these arguments stand up to the express provisions of the Convention. The groups expressed disappointment that the State Prosecutor would align himself with Habre in Thursday's debate. They noted that President Abdoulaye Wade had appointed Habre's lawyer, Madické Niang, as his special legal advisor, while Niang retains his role with Habre. Habre's friends and supporters in Senegal have also mounted an intensive lobbying and media campaign to have the case dropped. """"The attitude of the Prosecutor appears to represent an about-face by the Senegalese government,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"But we hope that President Wade, who himself suffered unjustly during 26 years of struggle for democracy, will be sensitive to the importance of a fair judicial hearing for those who have hungered so long for justice."""" The groups also announced that next week told Judge Demba Kandji of the Dakar Regional Court will take testimony from a French doctor who treated hundreds of Chadian torture victims, the president of Chad's truth commission and three former detainees who were mistreated in Habre's jails. In February, Judge Kandji indicted Habre on torture charges, and placed him under house arrest. It was the first time that a former African head of tate had been indicted for atrocities by the courts of another country. Habre has lived in exile in Senegal since his ouster in 1990. He now remains in his villa on the outskirts of Dakar while the investigation continues. Habre, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habre's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habre was deposed in December 1990 by current president Idriss Deby, who had been his army chief of staff. Joining Human Rights Watch and RADDHO in support of the complaint are, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH), the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (ATPDH), the Chadian League for Human Rights (LTDH), the National Organization for Human Rights (Senegal), the London-based Interights, and the French organization Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme.","Africa, Chad",""

""""Given the many atrocities suffered by the Sierra Leonean people, the international community should not put all its efforts simply into evacuating its own nationals from Freetown.""""     Takirambudde supported the statement of the U.N. Secretary General on sending a rapid-reaction force to Sierra Leone, but stressed that any such force should have protection of local civilians at the heart of its mission. """"The people of Sierra Leone must not be abandoned,"""" said Takirambudde. """"The U.N. should respond rapidly to their crisis, as well as its own.""""     Human Rights Watch also suggested that it is time to start drawing lessons from the misguided 1999 amnesty for grave human rights abuses in Sierra Leone. The Lomé Accord, signed in July 1999, included a blanket amnesty for atrocities-including summary executions, amputations, rapes, abductions, and looting-committed during Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war. Most of the abuses were committed by the Revolutionary United Front under the command of Foday Sankoh.     Human Rights Watch strongly opposed the amnesty at the time. In a historic move, the U.N. did state, at the time of the pact's signing, that it did not consider itself bound by the pact's amnesty, but the international community took no steps to establish a mechanism for bringing the perpetrators to justice. Even within Sierra Leone the amnesty also does not cover atrocities committed since July 7, 1999-the date the accord was signed.      """"The amnesty was a terrible mistake from the very beginning,"""" said Takirambudde. """"It was adopted in the hopes that somehow the atrocities would end as a result. They have not. The international community must now ensure that there are consequences for the criminal acts committed by Sankoh and his henchmen.""""     Human Rights Watch noted that grave breaches of the laws of war and crimes against humanity committed during the civil war are crimes of """"universal jurisdiction,"""" for which any nation may prosecute the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, the nationality of the victims, or the place of the crime.     Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to strengthen UNAMSIL's mandate, to give the commanders on the ground the clear duty and means to protect civilians and to ensure the investigation of gross human rights violations with a view to the eventual apprehension and prosecution of those found responsible.     The organization also called on the member states of the U.N. to ensure that the full complement of troops authorized for UNAMSIL is rapidly deployed, and that these troops are of the quality- provided with the means-needed to fulfill the difficult task of maintaining peace in the Sierra Leonean context. Human Rights Watch noted that the member states of the Security Council, in particular the Permanent Five, have shown significantly greater willingness to commit their own troops on the borders of Europe than in Africa-except when it comes to evacuating their own nationals.     """"The strong international response to abuses in Bosnia and Kosovo stands in stark contrast to the way in which the appalling atrocities committed in Sierra Leone have largely been ignored,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Those countries with the resources to do so should provide troops, equipment, financial backing, and logistical support to allow the U.N. to fulfill the international community's responsibilities to Sierra Leone.

Earlier this week Tunisia allowed Zoughlami's brother, journalist Taoufiq Ben Brik, to depart for Paris, where he has been hospitalized as a result of the hunger strike he began on April 3. Ben Brik is vowing to continue his hunger strike until Zoughlami is released from prison. On Friday, May 6, Tunisian officials prevented Radhia Nasraoui, a prominent defense lawyer, from departing on a scheduled Paris flight to visit Ben Brik. """"It appears that the zeal of Tunisia's law enforcement establishment has been deliberately misdirected,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government should release Jalal Zoughlami from prison immediately and undertake an independent investigation into the beatings at the police station. Those responsible must be brought to justice.""""  Ben Salem, Ben Sedrine and Zoughlami were detained on April 26, along with Attaieb No'man, a Tunisian student, when police prevented foreign journalists and Tunisian supporters from visiting Ben Brik at his home. According to information Human Rights Watch has received, the four were ordered to lie face down on the floor of a room in the el-Manar police station. A police officer then began kicking and beating them. Zoughlami attempted to prevent the officer from kicking Ben Salem, leading to the charges against Zoghlami for """"verbal and physical abuse"""" of a police officer. Afterwards, when Ben Salem asked to be brought to a hospital, he was instead taken in an unmarked car and left in a deserted, wooded area some twenty kilometers outside of Tunis. He was later taken to a hospital by passers-by.  Ben Brik, Ben Salem and Ben Sedrine are among the leaders of the Conseil National pour les Libertés en Tunisie (CNLT), a human rights monitoring group founded in late 1998 which continues to function despite the Tunisian government's refusal to allow it to register as a non-governmental organization. In March 2000 the CNLT issued a report documenting a wide range of systematic human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary restrictions on freedom of movement, routine denial of fair trial and other due process rights, along with wholesale suppression of the right to free expression and peaceful association.  The Tunisian authorities have long targeted activists Ben Brik, Ben Salem and Ben Sedrine, along with many other Tunisian lawyers, writers, and human rights activists. They have had their passports confiscated and their telephone lines cut for long periods. The government has placed their homes and offices under blatant police surveillance. They and their families have been harassed with menacing phone calls, attacks on their property, and physical assaults.  Ben Brik began his hunger strike on April 3 to demand the return of his passport, permission to travel, and an end to the harassment directed against his family. On April 10 he was charged with """"defaming the authorities""""and """"disseminating false information"""" following publication of two articles in Swiss newspapers. The same day police forcibly evacuated and closed the office of Editions Aloés, Ben Sedrine's publishing house, following a gathering of Tunisians and foreigners to discuss press freedom.  This week, apparently in response to public pressures from the French government, authorities provided Ben Brik with a new passport and dropped the charges against him, allowing him to travel. On Wednesday, however, a court sentenced Zoughlami to three months prison on the verbal and physical abuse charges. Ben Brik has vowed to continue his hunger strike until his brother is released.  """"We welcome the government's long overdue decision to drop the trumped up charges against Taoufiq Ben Brik,"""" said Megally, """"but as Taoufiq himself has insisted, the issue is much broader than the government's persecution of one individual.

Israeli air strikes on Wednesday and Thursday killed two Lebanese civilians and injured twelve others, including a two-month baby. In retaliation, Hizballah forces launched Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, injuring 28 Israeli civilians. Israeli reprisal air strikes Friday morning then hit targets including power plants supplying Beirut and Tripoli, an arms depot in the Bekaa, and the main Beirut to Damascus highway. """"The laws of war forbid targeting civilians,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"This includes the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons, such as Katyusha rockets, in civilian areas and the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure such as power stations. Both sides must end this round of illegal reprisals and commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law.""""  In February 2000, Israeli jets attacked electrical power stations in Baalbeck, Jamhour and Deir Nabouh, in clear violation of international humanitarian law, repeating an earlier attack in June 1999. No Israeli government or military officials official has made the case that this infrastructure is facilitating in any way Hizballah's military campaign against the IDF-- the minimum requirement to make these structures legitimate military targets. In contrast Israeli officials have explicitly stated that such attacks were reprisals for Hizballah attacks and to pressure the Lebanese government.  """"This is the third time in less than a year that Israel has deliberately attacked Lebanon's civilian electrical infrastructure,"""" said Megally. """"Using military force against civilians, even if the stated purpose is pressuring the Lebanese government to rein in Hizballah guerrillas, is a blatant violation of the laws of war.""""  Human Rights Watch also condemned the firing of Katyusha rockets into populated areas of northern Israel as indiscriminate attacks that violate international humanitarian law. """"Katyushas are inaccurate weapons with an indiscriminate effect when fired into areas where civilians are concentrated,"""" Megally added. """"Hizballah must refrain from using them in this manner.""""  Neither Hizballah's nor the IDF's conduct can be justified by the other's abusive warfare. International humanitarian law prohibits such reprisals against civilians or civilian structures. The attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure also violate the April 1996 Israel-Lebanon Cease-fire Understanding, designed to protect civilians and reduce civilian casualties on both sides of the border.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

As the annual Asian Development Bank meetings begin in Chiang Mai from May 6-8, the international human rights group expressed concern over a worrisome shift in the implementation of Thai refugee policy. Burmese refugees in urban areas, including Chiang Mai, are increasingly vulnerable to arrest and, in a few cases, have been forced to return to Burma,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The Thai government has legitimate security concerns, but those concerns do not justify acts which endanger refugees. With no let-up in abuses on the Burmese side of the border, this is absolutely not the time for repatriation initiatives."""" Thai policymakers apparently have made a decision to reduce the number of Burmese refugees in Bangkok and other urban centers, and to regulate more closely the movements of Burmese refugees in the country. In one particularly egregious incident in February, five Burmese in Bangkok were transferred to the border and then deported into Burma at Friendship Bridge. They were reportedly met on the other side by Burmese authorities and later incarcerated. The new direction in Thai refugee policy is in part a response to the siege of the Burmese Embassy in Bangkok in October 1999 and that of the Ratchaburi Provincial hospital in January 2000. The embassy and hospital sieges were the work of small, radical organizations, but the Thai government has used the incidents to justify a wider crackdown that affects the entire population of urban Burmese.  Details on the change in policy are set forth in a """"Background Briefing"""" on Thai policy toward Burmese refugees, along with recommendations from Human Rights Watch. The document is linked to this release in """"related material"""" above. In addition to the new pressures facing existing refugees in urban areas, a new admissions procedure in border regions poses dangers for newly arriving refugees. Although the decision to adopt review procedures represents a positive development in Thai refugee policy, the way the procedures are being implemented is not providing protection to refugees in need, putting many at risk of rejection and forced return. The Thai government is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, which provide a universally accepted definition of a refugee, nor does it have its own domestic refugee law to offer legal guidance. The traditional Thai definition of a refugee used in official statements translates as """"person fleeing conflict."""" The U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees has pressed the Thai government to accept a broader definition of persons fleeing conflict and the effects of conflict, which would include a range of issues including forced relocations, forced portering and forced labor. According to Human Rights Watch, even this expanded definition falls short of what is needed to protect comprehensively Burmese refugees in Thailand. Instead, Thailand should base its decisions on whether the conditions which forced Burmese to flee their homes are such that they are deserving of international refugee protection. In February, heightened security concerns for the Bangkok UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) meeting contributed to growing pressure on Burmese refugees and a crackdown on NGOs working on issues related to Burma.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

The new report takes note of positive changes in Vietnam in recent years as it has opened up to the international community, including human rights improvements. Tens of thousands of political detainees and re-education camp inmates have been released, thousands of Vietnamese who had fled abroad as refugees have returned, and the government has shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the U.N. on human rights issues. At the same time, significant human rights problems remain. Freedom of expression, free association, and other basic rights are still seriously constrained. Corruption purges have been used, in part, to target party leaders advocating economic reforms while hardline conservatives appear virtually unaccountable. Vietnam's domestic media remains under strict state control. Critics have few sanctioned outlets for independent expression. Communication among dissidents and between them and the outside world is hampered by interception of mail, blockage of telephone lines, and suspension of Internet accounts. When dissidents do speak out in criticism of the Party or call for democratic reforms, they are subject to interrogation by officials and heightened monitoring of their activities. """"Dissidents of all kinds are less frequently imprisoned than in the past,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Instead they are subjected to less overt forms of harassment and intimidation, including surveillance and restriction of their freedom of movement or their ability to work.

You know very well that in Vietnam, as in many other countries, everyone has the same legal and constitutional rights and duties and transgressors are all prosecuted according to the law."""" (The complete text of the embassy's response is available on request.) However, Human Rights Watch notes in its report that the government continues to use existing laws, and to pass new ones, which contravene international human rights norms and the standards laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam became a state party in 1982. Legislation remains in force authorizing surveillance of released prisoners convicted of national security offenses and the arbitrary """"administrative detention"""" of anyone suspected of threatening national security, with no need for prior judicial approval. A new press law passed in May 1999 effectively encourages media self-censorship by requiring journalists to pay compensation or publish retractions not only for inaccurate stories but for all writing deemed to violate the """"honor of any organization or the dignity of any individual."""" An appendix to Human Rights Watch's report provides a partial listing of individuals thought to be imprisoned as of April 29, 2000 for peaceful expression of their religious or political beliefs. Because of lack of access to Vietnam's prisons by independent monitors, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive listing of all individuals currently imprisoned or detained in Vietnam for political or religious beliefs. The government continues to insist it has no political prisoners, although the director of the Public Security Ministry's Prison Management Department stated recently that the inmate population included more than 100 people convicted of crimes against national security alone.

Civilians continue to be caught in the middle of conflict between government troops and rebels belonging to the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM). Recent months have witnessed not only intensification of the fighting, but increasing reliance by both sides on tactics that put civilians directly at risk. The Indonesian government has taken some tentative steps to address deep-seated public grievances in the province, but there has been no decisive break with past practices. The government's methods have continued to include brutal counterinsurgency measures that fail adequately to distinguish between combatants and civilians. According to Acehnese monitoring groups, over fifty noncombatants are being killed each month, some singled out for suspected sympathy to the rebels, others killed when soldiers open fire on vehicles at checkpoints or raid homes in search of rebels. Over the past year, activists, students, and volunteers delivering aid to encampments of Acehnese villagers displaced by the conflict have also faced army and police aggression.  On the rebel side, there is evidence that GAM guerrillas, who have significantly stepped up ambush killings of police and military, have physically threatened non-Achenese communities in Aceh, leading thousands to flee the province. The guerrillas have also reportedly summarily executed suspected informers and prisoners. This briefing provides an overview of the conflict and describes the recent increase in attacks on civilians, giving particular attention to attacks on humanitarian aid workers. It concludes with specific recommendations for combatting the continuing deterioration of civilian safety. Background Twenty-three years ago, a small group of separatists declared Aceh's """"independence"""" from Indonesia and have been fighting a guerrilla war ever since. Although the rebels have grown stronger over the past two years as exiles returned from abroad and the political climate within Indonesia has allowed more channels for expression of popular support, the rebels have never been particularly respectful of other people's rights and are by no means universally well liked in Aceh. Starting in the late 1980s, the rebels, using weapons acquired largely from raids on Indonesian military posts within Aceh, carried out attacks on soldiers and non-Acehnese migrants to the region. The Indonesian army's response was disproportionate to the threat. Using indiscriminate force, the army killed more than a thousand civilians, often leaving their mutilated bodies by the side of roads or rivers. Many more were arrested, tortured and arbitrarily detained for months, sometimes years. Hundreds of Acehnese disappeared. When Soeharto was forced to step down as Indonesia's President in May 1998, Acehnese expected rapid change. Soeharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, apologized for past abuses and established an investigative team which, in meetings with Acehnese, eventually received some 1,700 reports of """"disappearance"""" and were presented with extensive evidence of military atrocities. In 1999, however, there was a string of new military attacks and civilian casualties, this time fueling a massive civilian response. Responsibility for one of those attacks, a massacre of a religious teacher and over fifty of his pupils at an Islamic boarding school, is now the subject of a trial in the provincial capital Banda Aceh. In court sessions in early May 2000, a series of soldiers testified that they summarily executed twenty-six students who had been apprehended during attacks on the school. The soldiers testified that they had been ordered by their commanding officer to """"school"""" the youth, a term the soldiers said was often used by local troops as a euphemism for executing a detainee. The commanding officer in question, Lt. Colonel Sudjono, originally named as a key suspect in the massacre, has been missing for several months and is not present at the trial. Without his testimony, it is unlikely that the trial will produce significant evidence on the chain of command involved in the decision to open fire. Since Soeharto's fall, the situation in Aceh has become increasingly complex. A broad-based coalition of students, clerics, intellectuals, civil servants, and entrepreneurs--though opposed to the violent methods of the rebels-- have become outraged at the government's failure to put an end to the military's dismal record of abuses in the province and now share the insurgents' anti-Jakarta sentiment. Distrust of Jakarta runs deep, as do demands for justice for the perceived wrongs heaped on Aceh for more than a decade, and demands for more equitable sharing of the substantial revenues produced by oil, natural gas, and other extraction industries. Greater political, social, and economic autonomy are objectives now widely shared among Acehnese. Although there has been an overall increase in support for the rebel movement, the popularity of the rebels among ordinary Acehnese has continued to wax and wane depending on the perceived viability of other means of achieving greater autonomy. One particularly disturbing aspect of the conflict has been the increasing frequency of """"mysterious shootings"""" and assassinations by unknown third parties. Although a few such acts may be the work of local thugs settling scores, most appear to have a political objective, and rumors abound that most of the recent killings are the work of rogue soldiers or former soldiers seeking to destabilize the situation. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has conceded that former soldiers are to blame for much of the violence but has said that security forces have so far been unable to apprehend the suspects. The Wahid Administration's Response The government of Abdurrahman Wahid, which took office in October 1999, inherited the morass in Aceh and is trying a carrot and stick approach. President Wahid has called on security forces to use peaceful means wherever possible, rejected what would have been a disastrous declaration of martial law for the province, and supported dialogue between civilian leaders and parties to the conflict. In pursuing such policies, he has had to oversome significant resistance from military leaders who still wield considerable political power in Indonesia. The Wahid government has also proposed greater political autonomy and pledged a significant increase in Aceh's share of the enormous natural gas revenues in the province. The pledges are significant, but a long history of broken promises has created deep-seated suspicion in Aceh that will not easily be overcome. At the same time, security forces have stepped up counterinsurgency efforts in response to attacks on patrolling security forces by rebels. These operations include house-to-house sweeps and checkpoint searches that have been accompanied by arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, extrajudicial killings, and other serious abuses. Although de facto martial law, in effect for a decade, was revoked with great fanfare in August 1998, there have been a succession of police and military operations since then, often involving the presence of numerous troops from outside the province. Operation Wibawa [Authority] quickly followed the end of martial law in August 1998. This was followed in June 1999 with the arrival of contingents of special troops to """"safeguard"""" the June 1999 elections. Since late 1999, Aceh has been the focus of a counterinsurgency operation called Operation Sadar Rencong [Acehnese Ceremonial Dagger]. Phase I of the operation, unannounced, appears to have been simply the continuation of Operation Wibawa, described above. Phase II began in August 1999 with at least 5,000 new police and army added to the several thousand troops already in place. The operation was also said to involve civilian militias, a practice that has led to serious human rights abuses in the past.(1) In addition to the above operations, hundreds of other troops have been brought in to protect sensitive areas such as foreign oil and gas installations. Sadar Rencong III Under President Wahid, counterinsurgency operations have expanded. Since early February 2000, the security forces have mounted Sadar Rencong III, an operation reportedly designed to find and arrest some 800 GAM members. The operation was launched following a spate of killings of security forces in ambushes. According to police figures, fifty-three policemen were killed from July to December 1999 alone, and many more were injured. The counterinsurgency operations initiated in response, however, have relied heavily on roadblocks and brutal house-to-house searches often accompanied by indiscriminate violence against unarmed civilians. Activists and local humanitarian aid workers, whom many soldiers see as siding with the rebels, have been directly targeted. Acehnese contacted by Human Rights Watch in March and April claimed that the government is targeting civilians believed sympathetic to the rebels. Citing field research and information from hospitals and morgues, the Indonesia human rights organization Kontras recorded a surge in violence from December 1999 to March 2000, including 74 disappearances and 232 killings, most of whom were said to be noncombatants. The rise in abductions and killings in the first months of 2000 prompted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to issue a rare public statement strongly condemning the escalation and its impact on civilian populations, including thousands of internally displaced people. The ICRC director-general described the situation as """"very critical,"""" and noted that up to thirty people asked the Red Cross for help each week in finding family members who had disappeared.(2) An incident in March vividly demonstrated the inconsistencies in the government's approach, suggesting the difficulties the Wahid adminstration is having in controlling the army. On March 16, 2000, an unprecedented meeting took place between Indonesian acting State Secretary Bondan Gunawan, a key advisor of Wahid, and the GAM field commander Abdullah Syafi'ie. Although the meeting was said to have been constructive, and to have laid the groundwork for greater trust between the warring parties in the future, it was followed by army actions that negated any of the gains that had been achieved. Despite army promises not to conduct """"sweeps, arrests, or violence"""" in the area, the leading Indonesian daily Kompas reported that before dawn on the morning of March 17, security forces moved into four villages near where the meeting had taken place in Glumpang Tiga subdistrict, Pidie district. Pounding on doors, the security officer examined the papers of every resident and asked where Syafi'ie was hiding. Many were punched or threatened with rifle butts. """"My chin needed stitches after being hit with a rifle butt,"""" said Asnawi Jusuf (22), a farmer accused of being a member of GAM. Jusuf, found sleeping in a village hall in Meunasah Keupula, was beaten together with six other youths.(3) A military spokesman first denied that the event had ever occurred, and then backtracked, stating that further inquiry was necessary. Internal Displacement Whole villages have been displaced by the fighting. Displacement in Aceh tends to be a short-term, localized phenomenon. Typically following a nearby clash between security forces and separatists, or simply the appearance of troops in the area, rural inhabitants travel to the nearest market town, often the subdistrict capital. They typically stay on the grounds of the mosque for days or months until they feel it is safe to return. Displacement reached a peak in June and July 1999, with an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 internally displaced people (IDPs).(4) The numbers have since gone down, with a big drop when people went home for the fasting month of Ramadan in December and January. Continuing clashes and sweeps, however, mean that a new round of displacement could occur at any time, just as fighting in January produced new waves of displaced persons in Pidie and South Aceh. Although Human Rights Watch has not been able to confirm or deny the allegations, there have been reports that both army and GAM combatants have manipulated flows of displaced persons. Aid workers have alleged that soldiers have prevented villagers in some cases from leaving their homes and, in other cases, have emptied camps by force. There have also been allegations that GAM has caused or at least directed displacement, discouraging people from going to stay with relatives instead of in a large, centralized camp. Possible reasons include the greater visibility that large displaced populations give the Aceh problem, and the opportunities camps provide for GAM to recruit and travel among the wider community. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers There are increasing numbers of student groups, NGOs, journalists, and others traveling to investigate and assist displaced populations and victims of human rights violations. Activists and student volunteers have been subject to arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, physical assault, and in several cases disappearance or extrajudicial killing. Attacks on activists have been well documented.(5) There has been less attention paid to aid workers and volunteers who have also been targeted. There are a small number of international or national aid agencies operating in Aceh, including Oxfam UK, MSF, Save the Children, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Most have begun operations only recently, and must contend with the obstacles inherent in a conflict situation with quickly shifting populations. In this context, numerous student and other local NGO efforts have sprung up to assist displaced populations. Some of these voluntary groups have links to more politically active student organizations that are calling for a referendum on independence, but even such groups officially remain separate entities with humanitarian aims. They provide food and basic health supplies, and also report on human rights abuses or help people find missing family members. Given the central role of students in demonstrations and in the referendum movement, and the fact that some volunteers also participate in pro-referendum activities, security forces either do not believe or do not understand the humanitarian intent of such groups. Although members of other NGOs have also been subject to arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, and obstruction to their work, student volunteers have been singled out for harsh treatment. The root of the problem is that the army views both displaced people themselves and those that come to their aid with suspicion. Several Acehnese volunteers interviewed by Human Rights Watch explained that, after a rebel attack on police or military personnel, volunteers in the vicinity are often caught up in the sweeps or singled out for revenge attacks. Volunteer posts, typically set up by students to coordinate aid efforts and disseminate information are a frequent target. Volunteers told Human Rights Watch of cases in which posts were razed, volunteers physically attacked and detained, and medicine and supplies seized. As one volunteer who had worked at a post near a large camp for displaced villagers told Human Rights Watch: """"After a clash in Cot Bate, 20 km away, 50 officers came to the volunteer post. They destroyed it and took medicine [we had planned to deliver to the camps] saying 'This medicine is for GAM, not the people.'""""(6) Access to victims is also often limited. One aid volunteer interviewed by Human Rights Watch made clear that even hospitals are not safe: Around evening prayer gunshots rang out, and people later found [a man hiding] in a canal. He had been tortured, a man named Armiya (26). We brought him to Lhokseumawe General Hospital. We think he was victim of a sweeping that took place five days earlier, one of ten people detained. He told us while we were bringing him to the hospital that he he'd been taken to Lhokseumawe District Military Command 113. He couldn't take the torture any longer and tried to escape, but he was shot twice and hid in the canal. At the hospital soldiers and intelligence were circling the building. At 11:00 p.m. more officers came, I think Gegana [elite police officers] and Brimob [police mobile brigade]. They started inspecting the rooms, looking for the victim, so we left the building. We hid outside and watched them wheel him to the military hospital next door, Kasrem Lilawangsa. According to a member of the hospital staff who wouldn't tell us his name, the victim was tortured more. We never found out what happened to him.""""(7) Military leaders have said that volunteers should be treated well, but they have not carried through. Colonel Tippe, who commands half the province, has also stated that """"TNI [Tentara Nasional Indonesia - the Indonesian army] soldiers should be thankful to the volunteers, who have helped in some TNI tasks. These volunteers are actually coworkers and colleagues of TNI. They are not to be considered enemies or injured. In fact we need to give them protection.""""(8) In early January 2000, Aceh police chief Brig. Gen. Bahrunsyah Kasman met with some 50 hunger strikers from the People's Crisis Center (PCC), a student humanitarian organization that spun off from the more politically minded pro-referendum organization SMUR. Responding to their demands to stop attacks on volunteers, Brig. Gen. Kasman promised to act on any reports he received of his men mistreating volunteers. Volunteers report that such statements by commanders have not been implemented. According to one student who had volunteered to assist displaced people, hatred is particularly directed against humanitarian aid workers: On January 6, a bus of us heading home for the Ramadan holiday was stopped around 4:00 at a joint Brimob/Koramil [Subdistrict Military Command] sweep at Kuala subdistrict, West Aceh. They asked """"Who here is a humanitarian volunteer?"""" A few didn't have ID cards so they went through our bags to look for ID cards. One of them hit me with his gun five times, threatening """"I'll give you internal injuries."""" All 30 of us were beaten, about half of us badly. Then they made us lie down in the mud of the rice paddy. They said """"Its a good thing you're just students. If you were humanitarian workers we would have killed you.""""(9) In an incident documented by a local Acehnese human rights group, six volunteers in Bakongan, South Aceh district, were stripped and tortured by members of Infantry Battalion 131/Padang on November 18, 1999, after they questioned TNI efforts to disperse an encampment of displaced villagers. Some 1,400 inhabitants from the villages of Ujong Pulo Rayeuk, Ujong Pulo Cut, and Keude Bakongan had taken refuge in two area mosques following TNI sweeps through the villages. According to the account, at 4:30 p.m. a volunteer in the yard of the Baitul Halim mosque saw approximately fifteen soldiers from Bakongan subdistrict military command aiming their weapons at villagers and ordering the 162 families there to leave. The students were interrogated and accused of being provocateurs responsible for inducing the people to leave their homes. After 45 minutes the camp had been cleared and the students were taken to the soldiers' barracks.(10) One detainee's account follows: """"We were ordered to line up in the visitor room, measuring 4 x 6 meters, in the dark. Then I was told to take off my clothes except for my bathing suit. Then the Danton [platoon commander] entered and I was immediately hit with the gun butt three times in the chest and three times in the face, and kicked in the chest until I was bleeding. This went on for 30 minutes. We were separated and put in two rooms of three persons each, once in my room I was stripped naked, jabbed and kicked all over my body for about an hour. . . I was accused of being GAM and made to admit I was a GAM member. Then a soldier yelled outside """"Is the grave ready?""""(11) According to the account, the five other detainees were then ordered to the front room and told to sit in front of a GAM flag that had been put up. They were told to dress and were threatened """"If you report this incident then we will find you where ever you are and shoot you all. If we can't find you we'll wipe out your whole family."""" At 12:15 a.m. the five were sent home, and the sixth was released in the evening of the next day.(12) The volunteers decided to go public with their story, holding a press conference and bringing a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission representative for Aceh. Military Resort Commander Col. Syarifuddin Tippe promised that Second Lt. R Sumanti, of Infantry Battalion 131 Padang, and five of his men would soon be brought to a military court, pledging that """"we will not hesitate to act on TNI officers that offend the people. Quickly report it to me, and I will surely act.""""(13) To date, however, there have been no prosecutions. Intimidation of Civilians by Rebels There is evidence that GAM has pressured non-Acehnese residents, some of whom have lived in Aceh for decades, to flee the province. Since mid-1999, many migrants from other parts of Sumatra have returned home, while Javanese have either gone back to Java or are living in temporary camps just over the border in North Sumatra. Flows increased prior to the December 4, 1999 anniversary of GAM's declaration of independence, when violence was anticipated, and continued into the new year. Although not all attacks on non-Acehnese can be attributed to GAM, and in some cases, may be the work of third parties seeking to further polarize the conflict and lay the blame on GAM, there is also evidence of GAM involvement. Departure of non-Acehnese typically has followed acts of violence or threats of violence. One woman from Julok, East Aceh district, told Human Rights Watch that she left home at the beginning of January 2000 after the local village head was killed by unknown men.(14) A Javanese man from Simpang Kiri subdistrict, South Aceh, who had lived in the province since 1985, told Human Rights Watch """"I'm telling you what happened and no more. In our village GAM showed us a bullet and said we had a choice of the bullet or the road. GAM flags were kept up long after December 4 [the GAM anniversary] . . . We were threatened both to go and not to go, to make us afraid and confused.""""(15) Human Rights Watch was shown a letter that an eyewitness said had been posted in his village under the letterhead ASNLF (Acheh-Sumatra National Liberation Front - another name used by GAM).(16) The letter contained warnings to district and subdistrict heads, the army, and migrants: """"Javanese transmigrants in Aceh-Sumatra must soon pull out. Do not stay in Aceh-Sumatra, complain to your king who tortures you."""" The civilian population thus finds itself caught between two armed groups, and displacement itself has become highly politicized. Civilians are caught in the middle. Recommendations Indonesia's donors must insist that military abuses end and that all cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, rape, summary execution, and other offenses are fully and impartially investigated and vigorously prosecuted. Foreign military assistance programs, including training and the transfer of weapons and arms supplies, should be conditioned on concrete progress in ending abuses in Aceh and bringing to justice soldiers, including senior military commanders, responsible for serious human rights violations. Security forces and GAM rebels must maintain the distinction between combatants and civilians and fully respect the protections contained in the Geneva Accords and the U.N.'s Guiding Principles on Internally Displaced Persons, including the principle that """"[e]very internally displaced person has the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his or her residence.""""(17) The current counterinsurgency operation, Sadar Rencong III, which military officials themselves have described as employing """"repressive"""" tactics, is widely perceived as responsible for a sharp increase in civilian fatalities. The operation should be ended or revised immediately and replaced by an approach based on commitment to civilian safety. The government of President Wahid should take immediate action to end army attacks against the staff of humanitarian organizations and other civilians in Aceh. Both the government and GAM should allow unimpeded access by humanitarian personnel and relief workers assisting civilians. Volunteers and security forces alike should receive training in principles of humanitarian assistance. Aceh needs a comprehensive justice effort. The Indonesian Human Rights Commission recently announced its intention to set up a commission of inquiry for Aceh similar to the one created to investigate the army-backed, orchestrated mayhem that wracked East Timor after the U.N.-sponsored vote there in September 1999. Creation of such a commission would be an important first step. Investigations should get underway as soon as possible, and should be followed by prosecutions and a systematic accounting of gross rights violations going back at least to 1989, when indiscriminate military response to rebel attacks first claimed large numbers of civilian casualties. 1 """"Kapolri Nyatankan Perang Terbuka dengan GBPK Aceh,"""" Waspada, August 2, 1999. 2 """"Aceh atrocities 'commonplace',"""" Associated Press, March 15, 2000 3 """"Aparat Obrak-abrik Empat Desa - Usai Pertemuan Abdullah Syafi'ie-Bondan Gunawan,"""" Kompas, March 18, 2000 4 """"East Timorese Trickle Home From West Timor; Widespread Displacement in Aceh,"""" US Committee for Refugees, 24 Nov 1999  5 """"Indonesia: Acehnese Human Rights Defenders under Attack,"""" Amnesty International, February 23, 2000. 6 Human Rights Watch interview, Banda Aceh, January 19, 2000  7 Human Rights Watch interview, Banda Aceh, January 18, 2000. 8 KIPTKA Kecewa, Rekomendasi Kasus Aceh Tidak Ditindaklanjuti, Suara Pembaruan, 24 November 9 Human Rights Watch interviews, Banda Aceh, January 19-20, 2000.

Mr. Ganji has been moved from the relative security of an area of Evin Prison under the supervision of the intelligence ministry (section 209), where he was held with other political prisoners, to an area of the prison under the control of the judiciary.  This section of the prison, known as Rehabilitation Division 8, is used to house serious violent criminals and drug traffickers. Ganji is now believed to be held in a ward with 202 convicted criminals.  During a previous imprisonment in 1996, Mr. Ganji was held in this area of the prison, where he witnessed significant violence between the inmates, including the murder of one with a razor. Human Rights Watch is concerned that Mr. Ganji's security cannot be protected in such surroundings.  Akbar Ganji is also suffering from a lung infection. Tuberculosis is rife in the crowded wards of the part of Evin prison where he is now held.  Akbar Ganji, a prominent staff writer for the daily Fath, appeared before the Tehran Press Court on Saturday, April 22. At the hearing, the head of the court, Said Mortazavi, disclosed ten charges, mostly based on complaints from the joint chiefs of staff of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and other security agencies. They objected to Mr. Ganji's articles about possible official involvement in the murders of several leading dissidents and writers in late 1998, and in the March 12 attempted assassination of Said Hajjarian, a writer and key adviser to President Mohamed Khatami.

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called on the government to drop charges against Ben Brik, return his passport to him, and stop immediately the escalating campaign of intimidation against Tunisia's human rights defenders and their relatives. This kind of intimidation and repression against activists and their families has been going on for a long time, but the arrest of Jallal Zoughlami is an alarming escalation,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Once again the Tunisian authorities have responded with repression and physical force against people who are simply trying to exercise one of the most fundamental human rights, the right to free speech.""""  On April 26, Ben Brik, whose writings have criticized the country's sharply deteriorating human rights situation, acceded to appeals from friends and supporters to end his 24-day hunger strike. Throughout the day, however, police prevented foreign journalists and Tunisian supporters, including medical doctors, from visiting him at his home. In the confrontation the authorities beat and detained activists Ali Ben Salem, Sihem Ben Sedrine, Jallal Zoughlami, and al-Taieb No'man. Ben Salem, the 70-year-old treasurer of the Conseil National pour les Libertés en Tunisie (CNLT), National Council for Civil Liberties in Tunisia, a human rights monitoring group which still lacks legal status, was subsequently taken away and left in great pain in a wooded area on the outskirts of Tunis. He remains in the hospital where he is receiving treatment for injuries sustained to his back and legs.  Ben Sedrine, a member of the CNLT, who suffered injuries to her shoulder and one eye, and No'man, a student, were taken to al Manar police station for questioning and possible legal proceedings, and released later in the day. Zoughlami, who may have sustained a broken nose, was also taken to the police station but later transferred to Tunis Civil prison. He has not been visited by his lawyer and is due to appear in court tomorrow charged with """"unauthorized gathering in a public place,"""" """"violence against law-enforcement officials,"""" and """"inciting people to break the law."""" As a result of these events Ben Brik has resumed his hunger strike. """"These charges are preposterous. Zoughlami is being victimized largely because he intervened to stop police from beating up and abducting a 70-year-old man,"""" Amnesty International said. """"This relentless persecution of Taoufiq Ben Brik and his colleagues also stems from the fact that the CNLT continues to tell the truth about the dreadful situation in Tunisia. The fact that the Tunisian government continues to block NGO's and foreign web sites and that the Tunisian media has remained entirely mute about this whole affair speaks volumes about the state of free expression in the country today,"""" Amnesty International added.  On the evening prior to his brother's arrest, Ben Brik's wife, Azza, and a group of lawyers were also assaulted and prevented from visiting Ben Brik in the hospital. They include Bar Council member Radhia Nasraoui; Chawki Tabib, Secretay General of the Association Tunisienne des Jeunes Avocats (ATJA), Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers; ATJA Secretary General Mohamed Salah Chatti; former Bar Council Secretary General Jamaleddine Bida; LTDH board member Fadhel Ghedamsi, Mourad Belbich and Ayachi Hammami. Today lawyers throughout Tunisia are observing a one-day strike called for by the Bar Council to protest the assault on their colleagues.  On Wednesday some thirty Tunisian police also turned back a visiting five-person French journalist delegation headed by Robert Menard and Virginie Lecussol of the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. According to Menard, they too were assaulted by the police, though not injured, and their materials, including cameras, were seized and destroyed.  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also called for full and impartial investigations into the beating and ill-treatment of the journalists, activists and their relatives, and urged that those found responsible be brought to justice.  Background  Taoufiq Ben Brik began his hunger strike on April 3 to protest the government's confiscation of his passport since April 1999, repeated government harassment of his family, and intimidation of Tunisian media from publishing his work. On April 10, he was arraigned in court on charges of """"spreading false information and defaming the authorities."""" These charges, which carry a penalty of up to nine years imprisonment, were in response to a January article in La Tribune, a Swiss daily, on police harassment of Ben Sedrine, and to a review in another Swiss newspaper in February of Notre Ami, Ben Ali (Our Friend, Ben Ali), a book published last year in France that was critical of Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.  On April 8, Police detained Fathi Chamkhi, President of the Rassemblement pour une Alternative Internationale de Developpement (RAID), Rally for an International Alternative for Development, together with RAID member Mohamed Chourabi and photocopy shop owner Iheb el Hani for possessing RAID and CNLT documents and charged them with """"spreading false information liable to disturb public order, defamation of the authorities, inciting fellow-citizens to violate the laws of the country, and belonging to an unauthorized association."""" They remain in detention.  On April 10, the police forcibly evacuated and closed down Sihem Ben Sedrine's publishing house, where Taoufiq Ben Brik was conducting his hunger strike, on the grounds that a public meeting held there the previous day in the presence of foreign journalists, was considered to have been """"a threat to public order.""""  On April 21, Tunisian police prevented the Tunisian section of Amnesty International from holding a public meeting on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. Security officers physically prevented Mahmoud Ben Romdhane, Chair of the organization's international board, and other AI members and guests, including foreign diplomats, from approaching the organization's office in Tunis. The former President of the AI Tunisian Section, lawyer Hachemi Jegham, was physically dragged out of the building. A similar incident had occurred on April 1.  On April 25, Ben Brik entered Mongi Slim hospital in Tunis after being advised by his doctors that he risked irreversible damage if he continued his fast. Complaining of police harassment at the hospital, he transferred to a private clinic on Tuesday. According to Ben Brik, plainclothes police subsequently entered his room in the clinic and abused him and his family. A confrontation ensued when friends from the Tunisian Human Rights League and the CNLT arrived to bring him home, resulting in injuries to a number of persons. Omer Mestiri, Ben Sedrine's husband and head of the CNLT, was abducted by unknown persons in an unmarked car and released some fifteen kilometers outside Tunis. One day earlier Mestiri had been knocked to the ground and his eyeglasses smashed after he complained to police conducting blatant surveillance of his private residence.  In May 1999, Ben Brik was injured when he was assaulted by three unidentified men wielding bicycle chains. The attack followed shortly after he had published an article abroad about the imprisonment of the vice-president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights. In January 1999, the windows of his wife's car were smashed following publication of his article discussing the case of some arrested students. Over the past several years Ben Brik and his family have been regularly subjected to menacing phone calls, cut phone lines, and police surveillance of their home.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

This report shows that human rights abuse in Rwanda goes beyond the ethnic conflict between Hutu and Tutsi,"""" said Alison Des Forges, consultant to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Tutsi-led government is now targeting Tutsi survivors of the 1994 genocide because they are supposedly political opponents.""""     In the past, the Rwandan authorities often discredited their enemies by accusing them of being genocidal killers or insurgents. Now, according to the Human Rights Watch report, they also accuse them of being monarchists who want the former king to return to power. The king, Kigeri V Ndahindurwa, was ousted by a Hutu-led revolution forty years ago and currently lives in exile in the United States.     Among other cases, Human Rights Watch examines the assassination of Assiel Kabera, former counselor to the president and a leader of the community of genocide survivors.     The report says Joseph Kabuye Sebarenzi, former speaker of the National Assembly, fled Rwanda because he feared assassination after having been accused of supporting the return of the king. Sebarenzi, who was forced to resign in early January, is a Tutsi with strong support in the community of genocide survivors. Meanwhile, a well-known Tutsi businessman, Daniel Ngenzi, has been imprisoned since August 1999 on charges of aiding RPA soldiers, themselves genocide survivors, to leave the country.     Rwandan military intelligence operatives recently forced five Tutsi, mostly soldiers or former soldiers, to return to Rwanda against their will after they had fled to neighboring countries. Authorities have linked these cases to the existence of a supposed """"army of the king."""" In another surprising development, authorities arrested some forty Hutu in the usually anti-monarchist northwest on charges of belonging to a secret monarchist association.     Human Rights Watch also documents the existence of illegal places of detention and presents cases of persons who have """"disappeared"""" into such places and been held incommunicado for months.     Human Rights Watch details killings and other abuses committed by members of the Local Defense Force, civilians recruited and armed by the government. Supposedly under the supervision of local authorities, the members of the Local Defense Force commit abuses without punishment in those areas where authorities are afraid of them or have benefitted from their crimes.     The Human Rights Watch report documents the massacre of thirty-one Tutsi by insurgents at Tamira in December 1999, a case which demonstrates the continuing threat to civilians by armed groups in the region.     """"It's true that the Rwandan government faces some risk of attack by armed groups, and some dissent within its population,"""" said Des Forges. """"But neither can be used to justify abuses against its own citizens.""""","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"

The largely student-led protests have called for the withdrawal of Syrian military and security forces from Lebanon. Yesterday, Lebanon's military court sentenced one student to one month in prison and another to ten days, while a third was fined and released. All were found guilty of distributing leaflets calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops and full independence from Damascus. Last week the military court tried eight others who were arrested as army and security forces forcibly broke up demonstrations in Beirut on April 17 and April 18. In those incidents, some thirteen people were injured, two of them seriously. The eight demonstrators received sentences ranging from ten days to six weeks in prison. Military court trials and prison should not be the response when Lebanese peacefully criticize Syria's role in their country,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"And senior government officials should not be suggesting that the exercise of freedom of expression at this historic juncture is unpatriotic. This is intimidation, and it is unacceptable.""""  In the time since Israel pledged to withdraw from occupied south Lebanon by early July, opponents of Syria's political domination of Lebanon have called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops. On April 17, dozens of demonstrators, mostly students, assembled at the justice ministry in Beirut to protest the arrest of two students on April 13 for allegedly distributing anti-Syria leaflets. The protestors chanted anti-Syria slogans, including """"Syria, get out of here."""" On April 18, protestors gathered again, this time near the National Museum. According to press reports, some put tape over their mouths to underscore the government's attempts to silence them. When this crowd refused to disperse on the order of a Lebanese army officer, security forces forcibly dispersed the demonstrators, and in an ensuing clash, several were reportedly injured. In the wake of these two incidents, some 1,000 students peacefully rallied on three university campuses on April 19 to cries of """"The Israeli army out, the Syrian army out,"""" and """"Lebanon first."""" Although the campuses were reportedly surrounded by security forces and army troops, there were no arrests and the rallies did not spill out onto the streets.  In reaction to the unrest, a statement by Lebanese president Emile Lahoud on April 21 said that he was """"extremely annoyed by attempts to incite confusion,"""" and added that the protesting students were being used as dupes. """"Young people must realize that those who are raising their voices today are being manipulated by embassies or capitals which are playing Israel's game."""" Human Rights Watch said that such remarks had a chilling effect, and compromised the right of Lebanese to freely express their ideas and opinions.  Human Rights Watch also criticized the prosecution of civilians in Lebanon's military court. """"Civilians must be tried in courts that are independent and impartial,"""" said Megally. """"The military court does not meet this international standard.

The 37-page report documents number of suspicious deaths and attacks on government critics that have remained unresolved because the government failed to conduct effective investigations. The government has increasingly used violence against street demonstrations by opposition parties and university students. Journalists have been convicted on a variety of charges and fined or given prison sentences for their writing and broadcasting. Criminal and misdemeanor proceedings have been initiated against opposition politicians and ordinary citizens who have publicly or even privately criticized the authorities.  """"The government has been steadily losing popular support since the NATO war, and it has become more repressive as a result of that fact,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Government critics are facing great danger in Serbia today.""""  The report, """"Curtailing Political Dissent: Serbia's Campaign of Violence and Harassment against Government Critics,"""" identifies several new methods of repression used by the Serbian government since the NATO war. One method is the so-called informative talk, actually a form of interrogation, used by the police to intimidate student activists from the Otpor (Resistance) group, journalists, and opposition politicians. The government also informally recruits civilian thugs to disperse protests and to beat or arrest dissenters.  The campaign of violence and harassment has been accompanied by the unprecedented use of aggressive language by government officials and the state-controlled media, including insults and threats against the political opposition and independent journalists.  The Human Rights Watch report calls on the Serbian government to establish an independent commission of inquiry, in accordance with the U.N. Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (1989), which would carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the April 11, 1999, murder of Slavko Curuvija, director of the daily Dnevni telegraf and the magazine Evropljanin, and into the October 3, 1999, accident in which four colleagues and bodyguards of opposition leader Vuk Draskovic were killed. So far the investigations of both cases have produced no results.  The report documents numerous instances of the arbitrary application of Serbia's Law on Public Information, resulting in a severe crackdown against independent media. Fines have been used to financially cripple the media and deter public criticism of the government's policies. For example, on December 23, 1999, a magistrate in Vranje, a town in the south of Serbia, fined Vranjske magazine 1,000,000 dinars (U.S. $26,000) because it published a report by the Serbian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights about repression of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's south.  According to Yugoslav law, municipal and federal elections must take place by the end of 2000.

Ramsey","","04/24/2000","Dear Chief Ramsey:  We are writing to express our concern over allegations of police  ill-treatment of IMF/World Bank protesters. Human Rights Watch,  the largest U.S.-based international human rights group, monitored  the protests on April 16 and 17. Among the areas of concern: We question whether it was necessary to close the """"convergence"""" center, a space being used by protesters to organize their activities. The fire marshal and police officials claimed that the space was a fire hazard, yet most of the safety issues noted could have been addressed by removing propane stoves or other flammable materials or unblocking doorways, without having to shut down the entire warehouse on the morning of April 15. What exactly was the fire code violation that required the closing of the space? Had the property owners been cited previously for any pre-existing code violations?  Why were the """"convergence"""" center and the offices surrounding it on the 1300 block of Florida Avenue, N.W. closed for several days, including on Monday, April 17? According to some witnesses, despite a court order, police refused protesters access to get their belongings from the center on Sunday. On Monday, when the director of the charter school at the location asked for an explanation or court order from police officials to better understand why his school and other offices in the building were closed, a police officer on the scene reportedly threatened him with arrest.  Two World Bank employees were arrested on Saturday, April 15, near 20th and K Streets, N.W., while speaking with protesters. They report that other bystanders were also arrested. What was the justification for those arrests? Did police first give an order to disperse and were they allowed to leave the area? What was the justification for the mass arrests of approximately 600 persons on Saturday, April 15? Were they allowed an opportunity to disperse before they were jailed, some for as long as 23 hours?  In addition to members of the press who were arrested during demonstrations, at least one photographer, Hee Soon Kim, from Hana News Picture Agency-Korea and the Associated Press, was clubbed until he fell to the pavement with his head bloodied near 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue on Sunday, April 16 at about noon. Two officers identified by witnesses in the crowd as involved in the beating removed their name tags. One reportedly had a lieutenant's gold-shield, and the other had a badge number of 178. Has this incident been investigated by the MPD's internal affairs unit?  Television footage showed several officers striking or pushing protesters in their faces with batons during encounters. Are batons ever supposed to be used above the shoulders when an officer is attempting to """"control"""" or move an unarmed person?  What exactly were the criteria for spraying pepper spray at demonstrators? For example, if they approached a barrier but did not touch it, would officers use spray?  How many protesters were injured during arrests or encounters with police during the period beginning on Friday, April 15 until Wednesday, April 19? How many required treatment at a hospital?  Are any police officers on the MPD now being investigated for their ill-treatment of protesters or others during the April 15-April 19 period?  Will officers who sprayed pepper spray without justification, used batons without justification, or fired tear gas canisters without justification be disciplined in any manner?  Since many of the protesters are from out of town, it is likely they will not file complaints directly with the MPD, and if they do, it is likely they would not be able to pursue those complaints thoroughly. Since many of the encounters were videotaped by police, protesters, and the media, those tapes should be reviewed and should lead to investigations into possible mistreatment, whether or not individuals file formal complaints. Will you ensure that those MPD officers who may have used excessive force are investigated fully, and, if found responsible for using excessive force, disciplined appropriately?

Human Rights Watch is the largest, U.S.-based  international human rights organization. We monitor human rights  around the world, including in the United States. We have several questions regarding allegations of ill-treatment: As you know, many protesters and others who were arrested during the demonstrations between April 15 and 19 have complained that they were not provided with adequate food, water, bathroom facilities, legal counsel, phone access or medical attention or medication. Knowing that mass arrests were likely, how did you prepare to ensure that there would be food and water available for the detainees? How was access to phones, legal counsel, bathroom facilities and medical attention ensured? How often were meals served? How was water provided? Were all detainees allowed to make a legal or other phone call while in detention? If a detainee requested his or her medication, how did U.S. Marshal's respond? Were detainees handcuffed for most of the time they were in detention? If so, why was such handcuffing necessary? Many protesters reported that they were threatened, punched, and shoved into doors, walls, and parts of transport buses by U.S. Marshals while handcuffed. We have received reports that U.S. Marshals threatened male and female protesters in detention with sexual abuse by other inmates. Those who spoke up about abusive treatment reportedly were singled out for additional threats or mistreatment. Marshals also reportedly made comments indicating that the detainees would be subjected to abuses if they did not provide their names. According to protesters' accounts we have received, the protesters believed threats and abusive treatment were used to pressure the protesters to provide their names and be processed out. How will you investigate these allegations of physical and verbal abuse? How should a detainee file a complaint if he or she witnessed or experienced ill-treatment?  As you know, many of those detained were from out of town. Most will not be able to pursue complaints, even if they did file them initially. Will you conduct any type of review, absent complaints, regarding these allegations? Are there video cameras in the holding areas that might help determine the veracity of some of these complaints?

The European Union, backed by a half-dozen other countries, has presented a draft resolution that would deplore the abuses in Chechnya; call for an independent Russian probe leading to trials; request visits to the region by special U.N. envoys on torture, summary executions, violence against women, the internally displaced, and children and armed conflict; and urge Russia to allow access to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The E.U. resolution has been held in abeyance, however, as its sponsors and Russia negotiate a consensus """"Chairman's statement"""" due to be considered on Tuesday. Earlier this week, both Russia and the European Union circulated competing draft statements, which are understood to be radically different.

Human Rights Watch has documented the summary executions of more than 120 civilians in Chechnya, as well as many others abuses (see https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/russia/chechnya/).  Human Rights Watch said that in order to be meaningful, any U.N. Commission statement or resolution needed to contain the following elements:  - a recognition that serious human rights abuses and war crimes have been committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, including mass killings, summary executions, torture, rape, and pillage;  - a recognition that Russia's prosecutorial agencies have so far failed to investigate these abuses;  - a demand for a credible and independent investigation into allegations of abuse, with a strong international role;  -immediate access to Chechnya for international monitors to investigate allegations of abuse; and  -transparency in domestic investigative and prosecutorial efforts into abuses in Chechnya.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/04/19/aceh-needs-comprehensive-justice-effort","Aceh Needs Comprehensive Justice Effort","Aceh Needs Comprehensive Justice Effort","","04/19/2000","New York -- Human Rights Watch today challenged the Indonesian government to systematically prosecute widespread atrocities in Aceh. The call came as a long-delayed human rights trial was finally set to begin in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital The crimes in Aceh deserve the same attention that the crimes in East Timor are getting,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The abuses in Aceh were systematic, but the government's approach so far has been piecemeal and ineffective. The current trial will be significant only if it is followed by a much more comprehensive effort to bring perpetrators to justice."""" The trial that is scheduled to begin today is the first of five planned """"connectivity trials,"""" in which joint panels of civil and military judges will hear evidence of alleged military atrocities against civilians. The trial, being held in Banda Aceh, capital of the province of Aceh, will seek to establish responsibility for the killing of more than fifty people at an Islamic boarding school in Beutong Ateuh West Aceh on July 23, 1999. Soldiers opened fire on religious teacher Tengku Bantaqiah and his family and students. The army has claimed that there was an exchange of fire, but eyewitness accounts and preliminary investigations suggest the shooting was unprovoked. Human rights organizations in Indonesia raised concerns when the prospect of a """"connectivity"""" trial for the Bantaqiah massacre was first announced last November and the highest ranking defendant named was only a lieutenant colonel. Now the officer in question, Lt. Colonel Sudjono, has been reported missing and is either in hiding or is a victim of foul play himself. Without the chief suspect, the trial will focus on twenty-five lower-ranking defendants, and it is unlikely that the trial will produce significant evidence on the chain of command involved in the decision to open fire. Human Rights Watch noted several other deficiencies in the government's efforts to date. Only five trials are envisioned and only one, the Bantaqiah trial, has been pursued vigorously. Hundreds of other cases have gone completely unaddressed. In addition, the joint civil/military panel, though an improvement on a purely military court, is flawed. One problem is that the military judges on each panel can be expected to be biased in favor of military defendants. A second defect is that Indonesia's existing criminal code does not specify many human rights offenses recognized under international law.  Human Rights Watch has called instead for creation of national courts for past cases of gross abuses and has urged that such courts be staffed by civilian judges and expressly given jurisdiction over internationally recognized human rights crimes. Such courts could hear not only the East Timor trials but also the Aceh trials and all other cases of alleged atrocities against civilian populations. """"Some of the government officials who have been pushing for the Bantaqiah trial sincerely want to bring abusive officers to justice and this is a step forward,"""" said Saunders. """"But even so, there are glaring deficiencies in the current trial. Without a more decisive effort to establish justice, there is a real danger that the Acehnese public will see this trial as tokenism and dismiss the entire justice effort as an empty gesture."""" Human Rights Watch urged those countries, including the United States, now reconsidering military cooperation with Indonesia to recognize the weaknesses in the Aceh trial and to insist on an end to counterinsurgency abuses and credible prosecutions of the most senior culpable officers before resuming military sales or training programs. It called on countries concerned with reform efforts in Indonesia, including Japan, the European Union and its member states, and the United States to send observers to the trial to monitor how it is conducted. It also called on the Indonesian attorney general's office to provide adequate protection to the witnesses, several of whom have reported intimidation in recent months. Background Twenty-three years ago, a small group of Acehnese rebels declared independence from Indonesia and have been fighting a guerrilla war ever since. Although the rebels have grown stronger over the past year as exiles returned from abroad and popular support swelled, the rebels have never been particularly respectful of other people's rights and are by no means universally well-liked in Aceh. The situation in Aceh has become far more complex than a simple insurgency, as a broad-based coalition of students, clerics, intellectuals, civil servants, and entrepreneurs—though opposed to the violent methods of the rebels— have become outraged at the government's failure to put an end to the military's dismal record of abuses in the province and now share the insurgents' anti-Jakarta sentiment. The Bantaqiah massacre, as it has come to be known, is just one of hundreds of cases of alleged abuses against civilians resulting from a decade of counterinsurgency operations in the province. In 1989, guerrillas using weapons acquired largely from raids on military posts within Aceh carried out a series of attacks on soldiers and non-Acehnese migrants to the region. In ensuing years, the Indonesian army responded with ferocious and indiscriminate force, killing more than a thousand civilians, often leaving their mutilated bodies by the side of roads or rivers. Many more were arrested, tortured, and arbitrarily detained for months, sometimes years. Hundreds of men disappeared. Many women whose husbands or sons were suspected of involvement with the guerrillas were raped.  Although martial law was lifted in August 1998, just three months after Soeharto was forced to step down, intensive counterinsurgency efforts continue and new atrocities have continued to come to light, fueling separatist sentiment in Aceh.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak yesterday said that he will seek an amendment to Israeli law to allow him, as minister of defense, to order the continued detention of Lebanese hostages. The Israeli cabinet is scheduled to meet today to discuss the matter, and the speaker of the Knesset has already said he would convene an emergency session to vote on any proposed amendments. """"Hostage-taking is a war crime,""""said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"No domestic legislation can change that.""""  Barak's statement came in response to a Supreme Court ruling yesterday dismissing a challenge to the court's April 12 ruling ordering the release of eight of the hostages. The earlier ruling, which is applicable to all of the hostages held in Israel, found that the hostages were not a danger to state security and that their detention as """"bargaining chips"""" was illegal.  """"Israel's highest court has acknowledged that these detainees should be released,"""" Megally said. """"The Israeli government should admit its wrongdoing and immediately release them.""""  The fifteen hostages are part of a larger group of twenty-one hostages kidnapped from Lebanon by Israel and the SLA beginning in the mid-1980s. Israel has conditioned the release of the hostages to information leading to the return of Israeli POWs and MIAs. Five of the twenty-one were released in December 1999, and a sixth hostage, reported to be mentally ill, was released on April 5.  Justice Minister Yossi Beilin has said he will seek to renew the administrative detention of at least two hostages, religious leader Sheikh `Abd al-Karim Obeid and militia leader Mustafa al-Dirani. Under the Emergency Powers (Detention) Law of 1979, Israel can hold administrative detainees indefinitely without charge or trial. Obeid has already spent almost eleven years in administrative detention; al-Dirani will have been held for six years in May. Although Israel alleges that both Obeid  and al-Dirani held leadership positions in Lebanese resistance organizations, and that al-Dirani at one time had custody of missing Israeli soldier Ron Arad, neither has ever been charged with a crime.  """"From the beginning Israel admitted that it was holding Obeid and al-Dirani hostage,"""" Megally said. """"Calling them administrative detainees will not disguise the fact that they remain hostages.""""  Human Rights Watch also expressed deep concern over the conditions in which Obeid and al-Dirani are held. Despite credible reports that some Lebanese hostages have been tortured in Israeli custody, Israel has refused to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to monitor their treatment.  In March Zvi Rish, a lawyer for al-Dirani, filed a civil case against the Israeli government asking for an NIS 6,000,000 (US$1,473,900) compensation for torture and ill-treatment al-Dirani suffered while in Israeli custody. The case alleges that during the first month of his interrogation al-Dirani was raped, sodomized with a wooden club, violently shaken, beaten, deprived of sleep, bound in painful positions, and left covered in his own feces for several days as """"plain and simple vengeance.""""  """"Israel is legally obligated investigate charges of torture and mistreatment and bring those responsible for any abuses to justice,"""" Megally said.

Russian soldiers went on a rampage in the Chechen village of Alkhan-Yurt in December 1999, looting and burning dozens of homes and summarily executing at least fourteen civilians, according to the 32-page report. The report criticizes Russia's military and political leadership for failing to investigate the crime, and charges that Russia's military command is complicit to the abuses. The events in Alkhan-Yurt were previously revealed in Human Rights Watch press releases, but the new report provides a more comprehensive account of the massacre and its victims. Human Rights Watch called on British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is receiving president-elect Vladimir Putin of Russia in London today and tomorrow, to warn his guest that Britain will take Russia to the European Court of Human Rights if the massacres are not fully investigated by Russian prosecutors.

""""There can be no question about what happened there. The only question is what Russia -- and its international partners -- are going to do about it."""" Russia's military began shelling and bombing Alkhan-Yurt in November 1999. The offensive lasted until December 1, when Russian troops entered the village and went from house to house to ensure that no fighters were left. During this so-called """"mop-up"""" operation, soldiers threw live grenades into basements, began looting houses and sent hundreds of residents to a neighboring village. In the two weeks following December 1, soldiers sealed off the village and went on a rampage, looting and burning many homes, killing at least fourteen civilians, and raping several women. When the allegations first emerged, the Russian military and political leadership dismissed them out of hand, claiming that Chechen rebels had unleashed an """"information war."""" Then, as evidence of the killing mounted, the military procuracy was forced to open a criminal investigation into the events. However, this investigation: it focused only on the period leading up to and including the seizure of the village by Russian forces, although the rampage took place in the two following weeks. The military procuracy told Human Rights Watch that it had closed the investigation and no one was charged.

Your failure clearly to condemn the war crimes committed by Russian forces and to call for accountability will undermine the action taken by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. As you know, last week that body voted to strip the Russian delegation of its voting rights, put Russia on notice that it risked suspension from the organization, and called on member states to file an inter-state complaint with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Your meeting with President-elect Putin last month in St. Petersburg signaled that Britain was eager to play a leading role in developing a strong relationship with Russia in the post-Yeltsin era, but that it was unwilling to use this relationship as leverage to secure better human rights compliance by the Russian government. We believe that at this juncture Britain must play a critical role in maintaining pressure on the Russian government to curtail abuses by its forces in Chechnya, and to punish those who have perpetrated war crimes and other violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. As I am sure you are aware, these abuses include the mass, summary execution of civilians, arbitrary detention and subsequent beating and torture of detainees, the indiscriminate bombardment of densely populated areas, systematic looting, and rape. In particular, there is an urgent need to ensure that war crimes, such as the summary execution of civilians in Alkhan-Yurt and the Staropromyslovsky and Aldi districts of Grozny, be vigorously prosecuted. We remain skeptical as to the willingness of the Russian authorities to investigate and punish these crimes in a transparent, credible, and vigorous manner. You should make absolutely clear to President-elect Putin that if the investigations currently underway prove to have been carried out in bad faith or should they fail to result in prosecutions, Britain will take the lead in calling for an international commission of inquiry and will file an inter-state complaint against Russia with the European Court of Human Rights for gross violations of human rights. In this vein, we also ask that you put President-elect Putin on notice that Britain stands prepared to withhold its support for loan payments to Russia by the World Bank and other international financial institutions.  We would also ask that you raise the matter of the disgraceful obfuscation by Russian authorities during the recent trip by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to Chechnya and Ingushetia. Mrs. Robinson was repeatedly denied access to detention facilities and massacre sites, and President-elect Putin also refused to meet with her. President-elect Putin should be made aware that Britain will fully support a strong resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, currently in session, that will condemn abuses and call for their thorough investigation. Only strong, consistent pressure on the Russian government can ensure that Russian forces will desist from the atrocities for which they have become notorious, and that their perpetrators will be held accountable.

The government ordered the closure of Editions Aloés following a gathering there on April 9 of more than eighty people to discuss Tunisian government restrictions on press freedoms and to support journalist Toufik Ben Brik. Ben Brik, who writes for several European news organizations and is unable to publish in Tunisia, began a hunger strike at the offices of the publishing house on April 3 to protest continued official harassment and the confiscation of his passport.  On Monday the governor of Tunis ordered the publishing house closed for three months and sealed the office on the grounds that the Sunday meeting had been """"unauthorized"""" and """"disturbed the public order."""" At around 6:15 pm on Monday evening, police moved in to evacuate the building.  Ben Sedrine and Ben Brik are among the founding members of the Conseil National pour les Libertés en Tunisie (CNLT), a human rights monitoring group that has continued to function despite the authorities' refusal to accept its application for legal status.  """"This is the latest in a series of blatant assaults by the government on Tunisians who attempt to exercise peacefully their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"These events demonstrate the determination of the authorities to silence those like Sihem Ben Sedrine and Toufik Ben Brik, who confront the absence of basic human rights and democratic freedoms in Tunisia today.""""  Megally also called attention to the jailing on Saturday, April 8, of two persons associated with a Tunisian nongovernmental organization, the Rassemblement pour une Alternative Internationale de Dévelopment (RAID), and the proprietor of a copy shop. Fathi Chamki, Mohamned Chourabi, and Ihab al-Hani were accused of having in their possession documents and reports of the RAID and the CNLT. The three remained in detention as of April 12, and face various charges, including belonging to an illegal organization, spreading false information, and appealing to citizens to violate the law.  Background  The offices of Editions Aloés were ransacked twice in December 1999, and the organization's computers and some archives were stolen. In late December and again in early January, security officials reportedly threatened employees of Editions Aloés in efforts to persuade them to spy on Ben Sedrine. On January 13, Editions Aloés' co-founder and literary director, Jean-François Poirier, a French national, was summarily dismissed from his position as assistant professor of philosophy at the Institut des Sciences Humaines in Tunis, and on February 13 he was given thirty hours to leave the country. In March the organization's telephone lines were cut. Ben Sedrine has also been deprived of her passport.  Toufik Ben Brik has been the target of numerous reprisals by the Tunisian authorities for his reporting on human rights issues in the country. On Monday, the same day as the closure of Editions Aloés, Ben Brik was arraigned before a judge on charges of spreading false information and defaming the authorities. These charges, which carry a maximum penalty of nine years in prison, were in response to a January article in La Tribune, a Swiss daily, on police harassment of Ben Sedrine, and to a February review in another Swiss newspaper of Notre Ami, Ben Ali (Our Friend Ben Ali), a book published last year in France that was critical of Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.  Ben Brik began a hunger strike on April 3 to demand the return of his passport, confiscated in April 1999. Following the forced closure of Editions Aloés, he is continuing his strike at the office of the CNLT, in the residence of Ben Sedrine and her husband, Omer Mestiri, secretary-general of the CNLT.  Ben Brik was injured last May in an attack by three unidentified men wielding bicycle chains shortly after publication of his article in a Swiss publication about the imprisonment of Khemais Ksila, a vice-president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights. In January 1999 a group of men presumed to be state agents smashed the windows of a car belonging to his wife, Azza, following publication of an article discussing the case of some arrested students.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

The threats are reportedly because of its role in providing humanitarian assistance to victims of labor abuse, including ethnic Vietnamese minorities. During the past two weeks, the Cambodian media has published a series of potentially inflammatory statements attacking Licadho for assisting a group of victims of human trafficking and exploitative labor conditions, some of whom are Vietnamese. Cambodian authorities now appear to be on the verge of arresting Licadho staff because of the human rights group's assistance to the workers. """"Any legal action against Licadho in this case is clearly unwarranted and should be condemned for what it is -- a transparent attempt to crack down on the legitimate activities of human rights groups in Cambodia,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division.  The Vietnamese workers had been trafficked to Cambodia to labor in a Phnom Penh garment factory, where they were detained and made to work in exploitative conditions. They were rescued from the factory on February 17 and placed in a temporary safe house, following intervention by municipal court authorities, secured by both Licadho and United Nations human rights staff. The plan was for the ethnic Vietnamese workers, who lack legal authorization to reside in Cambodia, to return to Vietnam once they had secured outstanding wages owed them from the factory. Local authorities have insisted that Licadho should be held responsible for the subsequent departure of a number of workers from the safe house. Last month, a Licadho staff member was detained for several hours by police and interrogated about the missing workers. In recent days local officials, in conversations with human rights workers, have threatened the arrest of Licadho staff. Rasmei Kampuchea, the country's largest-selling newspaper, has also published a series of articles attacking Licadho and stating that the group should be brought to court for failing to prevent the workers from leaving the safe house. Licadho has also received anonymous warnings, threatening that demonstrators would attack the group's office in Phnom Penh.

""""This weapon will be an indiscriminate killer unable to tell a soldier from a civilian,"""" said Stephen Goose. """"The Pentagon's alternative to landmines is no alternative at all."""" Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York, is a founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.  The prototype replacements for non-self-destructing mines were tested in October 1999, and the Pentagon is about to award a major contract for engineering and testing. A production decision is scheduled for July-September 2002, with as many as 523,000 units expected to be produced by 2005.  In September 1997, at the conclusion of negotiations on the Mine Ban Treaty (also known as the Ottawa Convention), President Clinton announced that the U.S. would join the treaty in 2006, if the Pentagon had identified and fielded alternatives to antipersonnel mines by that time. """"The Pentagon is not likely to meet the 2006 deadline, and the replacement systems they've developed so far would not be compliant with the ban treaty,"""" said Goose. In addition to the battlefield-override-system, Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the RADAM program.

The Committee has been mandated by Congress to make independent recommendations about potential mine alternatives. Human Rights Watch recommends eliminating the RADAM program, removing the target-activated feature from the non-self-destructing mine alternative, and making compliance with the Mine Ban Treaty a clear requirement for all aspects of the landmine alternatives program. Human Rights Watch also recommends exploring seriously non-material alternatives to antipersonnel mines (such as changes in doctrine and tactics) instead of the Pentagon's focus only on material solutions.

""""The appeal process will be a very important test of the system's fairness. It is imperative that the Sharif defense team have a full opportunity to challenge all alleged trial irregularities."""" Sharif was sentenced today to life in prison and found guilty of hijacking under the Anti-Terrorism Act after a trial marred by controversy. Last December, as the trial was underway, the military government amended the act to add hijacking and conspiracy to the list of offenses under the act. The intent of these amendments was plainly to facilitate Sharif's trial on these charges under the act. Also in December, the government amended the act to allow for the appointment of a High Court judge, and removed sessions court Judge Rehmat Hussain Jaffery from hearing the case. In January, the replacement judge stepped down, publicly complaining of the presence of intelligence agents in his courtroom. Ultimately, the trial was returned to Jaffery.  In March, Sharif complained that he was not allowed any consultation with his lawyers and alleged that his cell and the armoured personnel carrier in which he was brought to court had been bugged. Also in March, and only days before the final arguments were to be presented in the trial, Sharif's lawyer Iqbal Raad and two of his colleagues were assassinated in their office. Other members of the defense team charged that the government had failed to provide them protection despite repeated warnings that they were being harassed and threatened.  Enacted under the Sharif administration, the Anti-Terrorism Act violates international standards of due process as well as the right to free expression. While Sharif was treated better than some defendants, perhaps because of the international scrutiny the case attracted, courts established under the act are supposed to conduct trials within seven days. Convicted persons have only seven days in which to file appeals, and these too must be heard and decided within a seven-day period. The act criminalizes, among other activities, """"distributing, publishing or pasting of a handbill or making graffiti or wall-chalking intended to create unrest or fear"""" -- an ill-defined provision that could be applied against political speech.  Since coming to power in October 1999, the military government of General Pervez Musharraf has also required all Supreme and High Court judges to take an oath prohibiting them from making any order against the Chief Executive """"or any person exercising powers or jurisdiction under his authority."""" The oaths undermine the independence of the judiciary and immunize officials of the military regime from prosecution.  Sharif was found innocent on charges of attempted murder and kidnapping. Sharif's co-defendants were acquitted on all charges stemming from events on the day of the coup, when a civilian plane carrying army chief of staff General Pervez Musharraf and some 200 other passengers was prevented from landing at Karachi's airport, allegedly on Sharif's orders.","Asia, Pakistan",""

""""The United Nations must seize the initiative here -- not hand it back to Moscow.""""  Human Rights Watch has documented the summary executions of more than one hundred civilians in Chechnya, and believes the actual number is much higher.

On Monday, a state prosecutor in Tunis summoned Ben Brik to hear charges of publishing false information and offending public institutions. The accusations stem from articles about human-rights abuses in Tunisia that Ben Brik wrote for the European newspapers Tribune de Genève and Le Courier. If convicted, Ben Brik reportedly faces up to nine years in prison in addition to unspecified fines. Ben Brik, who is a founder of a local human rights monitoring group, the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), began a hunger strike on Monday to protest his treatment at the hands of authorities. He remains prohibited from traveling outside of Tunisia since authorities confiscated his passport last year.  """"This action is further testimony to the Tunisian government's utter contempt for critical and independent journalism,"""" said CPJ Executive Director Ann K. Cooper. """"Taoufik Ben Brik is a dedicated and professional journalist who is being targeted simply for doing his job. This harassment must stop.""""  CPJ and Human Rights Watch have previously protested the Tunisian authorities' harassment of Ben Brik and unwarranted restrictions on his freedom of expression. Over the last two years, Ben Brik has been the target of numerous reprisals from Tunisian authorities for his coverage of human rights. He has been detained by police and physically assaulted by presumed state agents. His telephone service has been regularly interrupted, and he has frequently come under police surveillance.  Last month Human Rights Watch awarded Ben Brik the organization's Hellman/Hammett award, given annually to writers around the world who have been the target of political persecution.  A copy of the letter to President Ben Ali is attached.  * * *  April 5, 2000  His Excellency Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali President of the Republic of Tunisia c/o His Excellency Noureddine Mejdoub 1515 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20005  Your Excellency:  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) are writing to protest the Tunisian government's continuing harassment of Taoufik Ben Brik, a free-lance reporter who writes for a number of European news organizations. He is also a founding member of the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), a human rights monitoring group that has been critical of state human rights abuses and whose application for legal status has been rejected by authorities.  On Monday, April 3, Ben Brik was summoned before a state prosecutor in Tunis to answer charges of spreading false information and defaming public institutions in connection with articles he wrote for European newspapers in recent months about the human rights situation in Tunisia. The first article, published in January in the Swiss daily La Tribune de Genève discussed the police harassment of Tunisian journalist and publisher Sihem Bensedrine. The second piece was a review of the book Our Friend Ben Ali, by French journalists Jean-Pierre Tuquoi and Nicolas Beau, which initially appeared in a February issue of the Swiss daily Le Courier. The book, published last year, includes highly critical accounts of human-rights abuses in Tunisia.  Ben Brik's case is presently adjourned until April 10. If convicted, he reportedly faces up to nine years in prison in addition to unspecified fines. We understand that Ben Brik began a hunger strike on Monday to protest his treatment at the hands of Tunisian authorities, including the ongoing ban on his travel outside the country since authorities confiscated his passport last year.  Monday's legal action is only the most recent example of state harassment against Ben Brik in reprisal for his coverage of human rights issues and other sensitive domestic issues. CPJ and HRW have written to Tunisian authorities on numerous occasions during the past two years expressing concern about police intimidation and other violations of Ben Brik's civil rights. Examples include:  · Ben Brik's telephone lines have been frequently interrupted and he has been the target of rigorous police surveillance near his home. · On January 28 1999, a group of five men, presumed to be state agents, drove up in a Peugeot 405 automobile and vandalized a car belonging to Ben Brik's wife, Azza. They smashed the car's windows and windshield, and stole a baby seat. Later that evening, Ben Brik received an anonymous threatening phone call. The two incidents followed the publication, earlier that month, of an article by Ben Brik in the Swiss daily La Tribune de Genève, discussing the recent release of seven students who had been arrested after protesting Ministry of Higher Education policies. · Last April, Tunisian airport police confiscated Ben Brik's passport, preventing him from leaving the country for a planned trip to Switzerland. Last month, Ben Brik wrote to Interior Minister Abdullah Qalal requesting that the passport be returned. To our knowledge, authorities have so far failed to respond to this request. · On May 21, 1999, Ben Brik was assaulted outside his home by three unidentified men wielding bicycle chains. The journalist suffered injuries to his right arm before escaping his attackers. The attack is believed to have come in retaliation for an article he wrote for the May 10, 1999, edition of Le Temps, a Swiss publication, in which he discussed the case of Khemais Ksila, a vice president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights, who was imprisoned for speaking out about human-rights abuses in Tunisia. Three days after the attack, Ben Brik was arrested without warrant in Tunis and held for about three hours.  CPJ and HRW view these acts of harassment and intimidation as flagrant violations of the right to free expression as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Tunisia is a state party. The ICCPR requires that states guarantee journalists the right to """"seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers.""""  We respectfully urge Your Excellency to ensure that Tunisian authorities immediately cease their harassment of Taoufik Ben Brik and allow him to carry out his professional duties without state interference, in accordance with international press freedom standards and his internationally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. Specifically, we call on you to examine all possible legal options to ensure that judicial proceedings initiated against Ben Brik are dropped. We also urge you to use your good offices to ensure that Ben Brik's passport is returned so that he may travel freely.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

According to reports collected by Human Rights Watch, Russian soldiers have repeatedly detained and beaten young men, extorting bribes for their release. In at least one instance, Russian soldiers threw a grenade at a funeral.  Four witnesses from Tangi Chu who managed to escape at great personal risk reported to Human Rights Watch that the village is deprived of food or water. Located approximately 25 km south of Grozny, Tangi Chu has been cut off since January 14, 2000. The village was the site of the brutal rape and murder of eighteen-year-old Heda Kungayeva on Sunday, March 26 (See, """"More Evidence of Rape by Russian Forces in Chechnya,"""" HRW Release March 30, 2000).  The four witnesses reported that young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are routinely detained by the Russian forces in the village, and beaten and humiliated in front of other villagers. Prisoners are then taken to the Russian positions in the hills where they are held in pits in the ground. The Russian forces inform the families of those detained that they must provide the soldiers with guns within two hours, or the detainees will either be killed or transported to filtration camps. The witnesses told Human Rights Watch that there are no weapons in the village, so the villagers are forced to purchase weapons from the Russian soldiers in order to exchange them for the detainees. The witnesses say, those detained are severely beaten and tortured.  """"Ibragim I."""" (not his real name) provided Human Rights Watch with the names and ages of twelve men who were arrested and detained in this manner between March 24 and March 28. One of the twelve had been detained, beaten, and ransomed three times. Another of the twelve is a deaf mute who was detained and beaten twice—the second time, his ribs were broken. Ibragim reported that a third man of the twelve was taken to the """"Internat"""" filtration camp in Urus Martan (approximately seven kilometers from Tangi Chu.) He was held for two days in a van and for two days in the detention center. His relatives paid three automatic guns and a car to get him released, after which the Russians released him in Tangi Chu to ensure that he would not escape the village. This man had three broken ribs, and his body was covered with bruises.  Ibragim I. reported that on March 26, the administrator of Tangi Chu, a Chechen, was detained and severely beaten because he had asked the Russian soldiers to allow the young people in the village to go to the school to vote in the presidential election. Ibragim I. told Human Rights Watch that he attended a funeral at the end of February during which the Russian forces came, forced several young men to strip naked in front of the other mourners, and beat them. These men were then taken in APCs to the Russian positions and held in pits until their relatives provided guns in exchange for their release. Both Ibragim I., and """"Alisa A."""" (not her real name) reported that these men were returned with blood flowing from their mouths, unable to stand.  """"Adil A."""" (not his real name) cited the names of several of the same men whom Ibragim I. described to Human Rights Watch. Furthermore, Adil A. and his sister """"Fatima F."""" (not her real name) reported that on March 18 or 19, a fifteen-year old, his father, and Adil A's twenty-two-year-old brother were stopped on their tractor by Russian contract soldiers in a military truck. The soldiers proceeded to beat the two young men with rifle butts and to kick them. Adil A. and some other villagers witnessed this, and when they came close, the Russians stopped and let the boys go. Both boys were covered in blood and could not breathe. Adil A.'s brother was cut on his lower back, and his face and body were severely bruised. Adil A. and Fatima F. further reported a second incident on the same day, when three men were stopped on their tractor and beaten approximately 500 meters from where the other three had been attacked. Adil A. witnessed the beating and Fatima F. saw the men afterwards. One of the men was cut across the top of his head and on his forehead, and the left side of his face was swollen and bruised. He had difficulty breathing due to the beatings.  Adil A. and Fatima F. reported to Human Rights Watch that on the same day, March 18 or 19, a twenty-year-old villager went into his garden to get wood. He was taken away by Russian soldiers, and no one knew where to look for him. The next day, the villagers were told that the young man had been accused of selling weapons. One half hour later, the young man was brought back into the village unconscious, and thrown onto the road. Adil A. spoke to the young man after he recovered consciousness, who reported that he had been tortured with electric shocks in detention.  Also on March 18 or 19, according to Adil A. and Fatima F., Russian soldiers launched a small grenade into the crowd at a funeral in the village. Two older men, both approximately sixty years old, were wounded by the shrapnel, one in the elbow and one in the thigh. The Russian forces surrounding the village would not allow the men to be taken out of Tangi Chu to a hospital, and the shrapnel has not been removed.  Ibragim, Alisa, Adil, and Fatima all reported to Human Rights Watch that in addition to the violence and beatings that are being perpetrated against the residents of Tangi Chu, there is a severe humanitarian crisis in the village. There is no water for drinking or washing. The river which runs through the village is polluted by the Russian forces who drive their APCs and trucks through the river, and can therefore not be a source of drinking water. Furthermore, the Russian forces have destroyed the pipeline which brought fresh mountain spring water into the village. The forces allegedly shelled the pipeline just past the Russian positions, so that the Russian troops can obtain fresh water from the pipeline, but the villagers cannot.  For food, villagers have been eating raw wheat boiled in water, and they are forced to cut down fruit trees for wood. Witnesses report severe cases of malnutrition, dehydration, tuberculosis, dysentery, digestive diseases, lung diseases, several kinds of serious skin diseases, and lice infestations. No medical care is available in the village, and the Russian forces do not allow villagers to travel out of the village to obtain care. One day in late March a Russian doctor was allowed to treat those civilians who had been either injured by shelling and shrapnel, or who had been severely beaten by Russian troops. This doctor examined some of the villagers suffering from other ailments as well. The next day, the doctor was transferred out of Tangi Chu, and the villagers have since been prevented from receiving medical care of any kind. Within the past few weeks, according to witnesses from the village, the Russian forces have begun to accept bribes from some women in the village to use their APCs to transport them out to purchase food. Human Rights Watch welcomes reports that the Russian colonel responsible for the rape and murder of Heda Kungayeva will be prosecuted. However, her case was not an isolated incident of severe ill-treatment. Human Rights Watch calls on President Vladimir Putin immediately and unequivocally to put an end to any and all human rights abuses being perpetrated against civilians in Chechnya. Human Rights Watch further calls on the Russian government to open immediately the roads into and out of Tangi Chu and any other blockaded villages, to ensure that the civilians receive food, water, and medical care, and to cease immediately the detentions and beatings of the villagers.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Prominent writers and journalists from all over the world have been recipients of this award since its establishment over a decade ago.  Matus is the author of The Black Book of Chilean Justice, an exposé of corruption in the Chilean judiciary, which contains a searing critique of the judicial system under the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Immediately following the release of the book in April 1999, a Chilean judge ordered the confiscation of all copies of the book on the grounds that it violated article 6(b) of the Law of State Security. Police subsequently raided the warehouse of the book's publisher as well as bookstores across Santiago, impounding the entire stock of the book. Fearing imminent arrest, Matus fled to Argentina and later to the United States, where she was granted political asylum. The Chilean government has yet to lift the ban on Matus' book.  Article 6 (b) of the Law of State Security, established in 1958, criminalizes the publishing of statements considered defamatory by senior government officials, the armed forces or the judiciary, and gives judges the flexibility to order the seizure and ban of any books containing such statements.

Fernando Tapias Stahelin`","","04/03/2000","It is my pleasure to write to you in response to your March 1 letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, a  copy of which was sent to me by Ambassador Luis Moreno. In it, you explained your reaction to  the publication of a recent Human Rights Watch report called """"The Ties That Bind: Colombia and  Military-Paramilitary Links.""""   wish to revisit some of the issues you raised in the interest of correcting the record. As I have said to you personally, I believe that Human Rights Watch and the Colombian Armed Forces have maintained a productive, though at times difficult communication regarding human rights in Colombia. I value that communication, and I hope that we can continue to share our concerns as well as our information in the interest of furthering the protection of human rights in Colombia.  Besides making reference to the letter, I would also like to highlight several statements made by yourself and the Colombian Army officers under your command regarding Human Rights Watch and specifically my work with that organization.  First, I must take issue with the personal attacks directed against myself and the false and inflammatory suggestions made against Human Rights Watch, an organization that I believe maintains the highest standards of research and accountability.  Most notably, the Colombian Armed Forces General Command maintains on its official Web Site a text that directly accuses Human Rights Watch and American embassy personnel of forming part of a """"strange and shameful alliance"""" with a criminal drug trafficking cartel and that their goal is to """"discredit(ing) Colombia's military forces."""" The text asserts that an American embassy official is a liar. By featuring these baseless accusations on its official Web Site, Colombia's Armed Forces implicitly endorses these spurious views.  These views are in direct contradiction to your stated commitment to human rights. This text remains available at the following address: http://www.cgfm.mil.co/gucobw.htm.  In your interview with Caracol Radio on February 23, you ask a rhetorical question that leaves listeners little doubt that you give credence to the accusation featured on the Armed Forces General Command Web Site. Indeed, we subsequently received telephone calls from several journalists seeking a reaction to the charge -- which they said was made by the commander of the Colombian Armed Forces -- that Human Rights Watch was in the pay of drug traffickers.  According to the transcript you forwarded to Senator McConnell of your reaction to the Human Rights Watch report, you had the following reaction to the Human Rights Watch report:  """"Now, what I ask myself is why is it that the fight against drug trafficking is so uncomfortable for some people or some organizations... why is there so much interest in not combating drug trafficking? I remember back in the times of the cartels when an attempt was made to pass tough laws against traffickers they moved heaven and earth, they moved every institution, (so) it is logical that when we now have a determined campaign against drug trafficking and the possibility that this would be the beginning of the end of drug trafficking, [the cartels] are also moving everything that they can move to make sure it doesn't happen."""" (emphasis added)  During the same broadcast, Gen. Jorge Mora claimed that I earned a """"very high salary in the United States"""" for attacking the armed forces, a clear insinuation of illegal activity without any basis in fact. General Mora also asserted that my work in Colombia was not performed out of a genuine concern for human rights, but for less savory reasons, saying, """"I don't know what the motives of Mr. Vivanco are to prevent a fight against drug trafficking in Colombia."""" (emphasis added)  In a separate response not included in the transcript but which I heard first-hand as I waited to respond, Gen. Mora added that I was paid """"millions and millions of dollars"""" to block the anti-drug package currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress. Of course, he had no evidence to cite to support this outrageous claim since it is patently false.  Other generals quoted in the Colombian media on February 24 echoed these false accusations.  Gen. Eduardo Herrera Verbel, commander of the Fourth Brigade, told the newspaper El Colombiano that """"It would be interesting to know what Mr. Vivanco's dark motives are to attack the prestige of the Colombian state and its armed institutions."""" General Herrera was mentioned in """"The Ties That Bind,"""" since he was commander of the Fourth Brigade when Major David Hernández, implicated in the murder of former peace counselor Alex Lopera, was apparently allowed to escape his supposed prison in 1999.  Gen. Jaime Ernesto Canal told the Cali-based El País that """"there must be dark interests seeking to prevent the United States from helping us in the war against drug trafficking."""" General Canal was also mentioned in """"The Ties That Bind."""" Colombian government investigators and Human Rights Watch interviews include compelling, detailed information that in 1999, the Colombian Army's Third Brigade under General Canal's command set up a """"paramilitary"""" group in the department of Valle del Cauca, in southern Colombia. The investigators identify this group by its self-imposed name, the Calima Front (Frente Calima), and told Human Rights Watch that they were able to link the group to active duty, retired, and reserve military officers attached to the Third Brigade along with hired paramilitaries taken from the ranks of the Peasant Self-Defense Group of Córdoba and Urabá (Autodefensas Campesinas de Córdoba y Urabá, ACCU), commanded by Carlos Castaño. According to these government investigators as well as eyewitness testimony obtained by Human Rights Watch, the Third Brigade provided the Calima Front with weapons and intelligence.  In your interview with Caracol, you characterize our report as intended to """"block"""" any military aid to Colombia. That is not correct. The report clearly states that any security assistance sent to Colombia should be conditioned on the strict observance of human rights. Given your stated commitment to upholding human rights within the institution you lead, I believe you should embrace these conditions and the opportunity to demonstrate publicly that Colombia's commitment to improving its human rights record goes beyond press statements.  Finally, I would like to respond to affirmations made to me in person by several Colombian military officers that """"The Ties That Bind"""" failed to give sufficient credit to the military for investigating the cases involving the Fourth and Thirteenth Brigades.  Our information shows that far from aggressively investigating these cases and ensuring that those responsible were punished in civilian courts as the law demands, the military did not pay attention to reports of abuses until the National Police and Attorney General's office had developed convincing evidence pointing to the involvement of military officers. Indeed, it was only after the police captured some of the kidnapers and obtained information that led them to exhume businessman Benjamín Khoudari's body that the military began its investigation.  Inaction on the part of the military is particularly evident in the case involving the Fourth Brigade, which delayed years in arresting officers like Major David Hernández, implicated in multiple cases of serious human rights violations.  In both the Fourth and Thirteenth Brigade cases, several of the officers arrested have left the military prisons where they were said to be kept. For instance, military authorities gave Sergeant Juan José Mosquera, implicated in the kidnaping and murder of Khoudari, a pass to leave the Grupo Mecanizado Rincón Quiñonez, administered by the Thirteenth Brigade. He never returned. According to our information, this soldier may have been linked formally to at least twelve other murder investigations, yet was allowed to freely come and go from an army installation.  After the escape of Major Hernández, mentioned above, Major Diego Fino left the Fourth Brigade just this March, in circumstances that remain unclear. As we noted in """"The Ties That Bind: Colombia and Military-Paramilitary Links,"""" the Attorney General's office has linked this officer to the 1999 murder of Alex Lopera. At the time, Major Fino commanded the """"Juan del Corral"""" Battalion.  I look forward to moving beyond the kind of personal and baseless attacks that do nothing to address the serious human rights challenges that lie ahead for Colombia. As always, we welcome the opportunity to address substantive issues with you.

The ban, implemented on March 25 for an indefinite period, applies to all outdoor gatherings in Kuala Lumpur of more than four people. The ban comes on the heels of restrictions on the popular opposition newspaper Harakah, the Islamic opposition party PAS (Parti Islam Se-Malaysia), and the critical media.   """"This is not the first time the Mahathir government has tried to silence outspoken opposition voices,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"One year ago, it was Anwar and his supporters. Now it appears to be PAS's turn. But the ultimate casualties are Malaysian democracy and human rights."""" The prohibition on rallies follows public protest around the government's increased repression of opposition media. On March 1 the Home Affairs Ministry restricted the popular Harakah newspaper to two issues per month, down from twice weekly, and banned it from newsstands. About 200 people peaceably protested the restrictions on March 14. Seven were arrested, including prominent human rights lawyer Sivarasa Rasiah, opposition supporters, and journalists. The circulation of Harakah, published by PAS, soared last year following its strong critique of the arrest and trials of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. In January, the newspaper's editor and printer were arrested under the Sedition Act for an article critical of the government. Their court cases are still pending. Another target is Detik magazine. On March 27, the Home Affairs Ministry refused to renew its publishing permit. A third, the youth magazine Al-Wasilah, has also received notice that its license may not be renewed when it expires in August. Under Malaysia's 1984 Printing Presses and Publications Act, all print media must apply annually for publishing permit renewal. There is no legal remedy or judicial review when the Home Affairs Minister refuses to renew a permit. Under the act, """"[a]ny decision of the Minister . . . to suspend a license or permit shall be final and shall not be called in question by any court on any ground whatsoever,"""" and """"[n]o person shall be given an opportunity to be heard with regard to . . . suspension of the license or permit."""" """"Rights guarantees have no meaning when they can be taken away at will by government decree,"""" continued Saunders.

The open memorandum was released one week before Peru's general elections, as the congressional Commission on Women and Human Development drafts amendments to the Law for Protection from Family Violence. The New York-based rights group called for specific reforms to improve the family violence legislation and to strengthen its implementation. """"Peru has been a regional leader in the fight against domestic violence,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But Congress must now rectify the law's serious omissions."""" Domestic violence is a serious, long-standing problem in Peru, with particular impact on women. Every year, thousands are beaten, raped, or psychologically abused by their intimate partners. Peru adopted the Law for Protection from Family Violence in 1993. The law, one of the first of its kind to be adopted in Latin America, was intended to ensure that victims of domestic violence have swift and effective access to protection and justice, but its impact has been disappointing. Although strengthened in 1997, the law still contains serious flaws. It does not protect women from marital rape or stalking, nor does it apply to women who are harassed or beaten by intimate partners if they are not living together. The law makes conciliation an obligation, rather than an option, in cases of domestic violence. This means women are forced to go to at least one conciliation hearing with their abusers before they can pursue their charges in court.  In addition, the judicial system appears fraught with bias. Police and medical examiners sometimes treat women in a hostile and degrading manner, state prosecutors fail to request available protection measures, and judges minimize the harm that domestic violence causes. Human Rights Watch urged the Comission on Women and Human Development to strengthen the definition of family violence, eliminate mandatory conciliation sessions between women and their abusers, and provide for more rigorous oversight and training of police, forensic doctors, state prosecutors, and judges.

In 1998, the National Police received nearly 28,000 reports of domestic abuse.(1) Yet with many victims reluctant to report domestic violence, the real number of women who live in violent interpersonal relationships almost certainly is much higher. For example, a 1999 survey undertaken by the National Institute of Statistics in metropolitan Lima found that no less than 82 percent of the 2,460 women who were interviewed said that they knew someone who had suffered some kind of domestic abuse within the previous twelve months.(2)   The state authorities in Peru have taken a number of steps to address this problem in recent years, and notably, Peru was among the first countries in Latin America to adopt special legislation on domestic violence. The Law for Protection from Family Violence (hereinafter """"Family Violence Law""""), first adopted in 1993 and subsequently strengthened in 1997, established a distinct and expedited procedure for dealing with cases of domestic violence and sought to define more clearly the respective roles and responsibilities of those within the justice system who are involved with such cases.(3)   In addition, since the late 1980s, twelve women's police stations have been established specifically to respond to violence within the home and twenty specialized sections have been created within regular police stations for the same purpose. Further, a system of Municipal Defender's Offices (Demunas) put in place since the early 1990s has taken on an increasing role in responding to the needs of victims of domestic violence. The most recent innovation has been a system of one-stop centers for victims of domestic violence, where women can find under one roof women police officers, medical examiners, and state prosecutors. The Ministry for the Promotion of Women and Human Development (PROMUDEH) has inaugurated nine such centers since March 1999. In addition, the vibrant non-governmental women's rights community in Peru has played a crucial role in both providing services to victims of domestic violence and pressing the government to improve its overall response to violence against women.   Despite this determined attention to domestic violence, however, as the investigations carried out by Human Rights Watch show, serious problems remain both in law and in practice. The Family Violence Law, despite its amendment in 1997, remains deeply flawed. Its definition of family violence is incomplete, effectively excluding entire categories of women as well as particular forms of domestic violence. Furthermore, the law privileges conciliation over prosecution, sending a troubling message that assaults within interpersonal relationships should be resolved through negotiation rather than sanctions.   Adding to the impact of these deficiencies, implementation in practice of the Family Violence Law is also seriously inadequate. From the very moment that they do so, those women who attempt to lodge a domestic violence complaint face a justice system which appears fraught with bias and incapable of affording them effective remedy or redress. Police are unresponsive and ineffectual; medical examinations by forensic doctors are frequently cursory and inadequate, tending to minimize injuries women have sustained through domestic violence; and state prosecutors and judges often appear to consider domestic violence insufficiently serious to warrant prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators. As a result, in practice women are afforded inadequate protection against domestic violence by the state, and this, in turn, serves only to deter women from making complaints and to mask the full extent of the problem.   Peru's international human rights obligations require that the state authorities take effective steps to ensure that women are able fully to exercise their human rights, including protecting them from threat or use of violence generally and within the family. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights, both ratified by Peru in 1978, require the state to ensure that all individuals enjoy the rights to life, security, and equal protection under the law, without distinction of any kind, including sex. Further, since 1982 Peru has been a state party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which requires state authorities to exercise due diligence in investigating, prosecuting, and punishing violence against women as a form of discrimination.(4) Peru's obligations to act effectively to eliminate violence against women are also set out in the Inter-American Convention for the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women (hereinafter """"Convention of Belém do Pará""""), which Peru ratified in 1996.   Human Rights Watch has been monitoring the state's response to violence against women in Peru for more than three years, and in this connection conducted two fact-finding missions to the country in November 1996 and December 1999. During both visits, Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed women's rights advocates, community activists, domestic violence shelter personnel, social workers, and private attorneys. We also interviewed officials of the Peruvian National Police, the Institute for Legal Medicine, the Public Ministry, the People's Defender's Office, and the judiciary. In addition, Human Rights Watch received testimonies from twenty-five women victims of domestic abuse. Most interviews were conducted in Lima, but domestic violence cases were also investigated in Tarapoto, San Martín Department, in order to assess the particular challenges that women victims in rural areas face when seeking redress. Despite the positive changes made to the Family Violence Law in 1997, Human Rights Watch found during its most recent visit to Peru that legal and structural problems continue to deny women access to genuine protection, remedy and redress.   Since November 1999, when the Commission on Women and Human Development in the Peruvian Congress established a multi-sectorial working group to review the Family Violence Law, a new and important opportunity exists to address the continuing problem of domestic violence in Peru. The working group, composed of representatives from both government ministries and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), has authority to recommend further amendment of the Family Violence Law. Upon deliberation of the working group recommendations, the Commission will present its final proposal to Congress at the end of April 2000. The Commission, it is hoped, will seize the opportunity to thoroughly examine and recommend improvements in relation to not only the provisions of the Family Violence Law but also the significant structural obstacles that prevent women victims of domestic violence from securing effective protection, remedy, and redress. This is essential if the Commission is to assist the state in carrying out its responsibility to exercise due diligence in the investigation, prosecution, and punishment of violence against women, and to ensure equal protection under the law to all Peruvian citizens, without distinction on account of their sex or other grounds.   This memorandum identifies both key deficiencies of the Family Violence Law and major problems affecting its implementation. Based on our research, Human Rights Watch has identified six priority areas for reform in law and practice. First, the Family Violence Law must prohibit all forms of domestic violence. This means the law must adopt an inclusive definition of family and intimate relationships, marital rape should be acknowledged as a kind of domestic violence, and specific forms of psychological violence, in addition to grave threats and coercion, should be explicitly included. At a minimum, this expanded, but not exhaustive, list should include stalking and repeated harassment. Second, the use of conciliation in domestic violence cases should be an option offered to victims with the benefit of free legal counsel rather than a mandatory step in the process. Third, the police must adopt report-taking procedures that respect the integrity of the victim and expedite the process. Fourth, the critical role of forensic doctors in determining whether an assault is classified as a misdemeanor or a felony means the medicolegal system deserves particular oversight to ensure that bias does not translate into the minimization of injuries. Fifth, every effort must be made to ensure that public prosecution functions properly so that women are not obliged to hire their own legal counsel to pursue their cases in court. Sixth, prosecutors and judges must act aggressively in carrying out their paramount duty to protect victims of domestic violence from further abuse. All of these steps are necessary to fulfill Peru's international obligations to combat violence against women.   Reforming the Law   Four years after it was first adopted, the Peruvian Congress recognized the need to strengthen the Family Violence Law. The law was thus amended in 1997, among other things, to expand the definition of family violence, improve victims' access to forensic medical examinations, and further clarify police and other procedures. The modified law defines family violence as """"any act or omission that causes physical or psychological harm, mistreatment without injury, including grave threats or coercion, that occur between: a) spouses; b) co-inhabitants;...f) those who live in the same domicile, as long as there does not exist any contractual or labor relationship,""""(5) and it delineates the roles that the police, the Public Ministry, and the judiciary should assume in the prevention and prosecution of family violence. The law is also applicable to ascendants, descendants, and relatives to the fourth degree of consanguinity and second degree of affiliation. This memorandum is concerned only with violence in intimate relationships between adult men and women.   As a whole, the 1997 amendments improved the original law significantly. However, these amendments did not address all of the shortcomings in the law and left intact particularly troubling aspects. Significant oversights have meant that groups of people are excluded from the law and certain injuries escape proscription. First, intimate partners not living together when the violence occurs are not covered under the law, denying many women the protections it established. Second, the law does not recognize sexual violence as a type of domestic violence. Third, while the law acknowledges psychological violence as domestic abuse, it fails to provide an expanded list of acts that would constitute such violence. Fourth, the law makes conciliation mandatory for anyone who reports domestic violence.   Cohabitation Requirement   The Family Violence Law only extends protection to women from their abusive intimate partners in cases where the abuser resides with the victim.(6) This excludes from protection all women not actually living with their abuser at the time of assault. This assumption, that domestic violence can only occur between men and women living under one roof, ignores reality and effectively endangers women's lives. Women are often stalked, harassed, battered, or raped by men with whom they share or have shared an intimate relationship, whether or not they have ever lived together. Similarly, violence can continue long after cohabitation has ceased. Jacinta Suárez, for example, one of the victims of domestic violence interviewed by Human Rights Watch, had moved from her abuser's home to that of her sister, but her abuser kept following her, forcing her to have sex with him, and, at least once, raped her at knifepoint.(7) The Convention of Belém do Pará recognizes the range of relationships in which women may encounter violence. It defines violence against women as, inter alia, that which """"occurs within the family or domestic unit or within any other interpersonal relationship, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence...(emphasis added).""""(8)   Marital Rape as Domestic Violence   In addition to excluding groups of women, the Family Violence Law also excludes a significant form of domestic violence: marital rape. Rape is a felony offense against sexual liberty in Peru, and the exemption for marriage was removed in the 1991 Criminal Code of Peru.(9) Nearly half of the women we spoke with in 1996 and 1999 had suffered rape or other kinds of sexual violence in their relationships. Under the current system, women who have been raped by their intimate partners cannot report the assault as physical domestic violence. They have two options: either file a psychological abuse complaint under the Family Violence Law, or file a standard criminal rape complaint. If they pursue this latter option, women filing a rape complaint do not have access to the streamlined process envisioned in the Family Violence Law. In theory, women reporting domestic violence can secure an immediate protection order, while this is not available in rape cases. Another disadvantage is that women who file a rape complaint must themselves pay for their sexual violence forensic examination, while the examinations for domestic violence complainants are carried out free of charge.(10)       Psychological Violence   Unlike sexual violence, psychological violence is explicitly prohibited in the Family Violence Law. Psychological violence is a significant problem in Peru: nearly one quarter of the 27,935 domestic violence complaints lodged in 1998 was for psychological violence.(11) Yet there is considerable confusion throughout the judicial system over what constitutes psychological violence and how to make it an actionable offense. This is due, in part, to the fact that the Family Violence Law fails to specify any acts that amount to psychological abuse beyond mentioning """"grave threats and coercion."""" A study commissioned by the Inter-American Development Bank proposes a long, if not exhaustive, list of the forms psychological violence can take. These include, but are not limited to, destructive criticism, threats of abandonment or abuse, constant or frequent persecution (e.g. stalking), and surveillance.(12)  Conciliation   Under the Family Violence Law, women who report domestic violence are obligated to undergo a conciliation session with their abusers before prosecution can proceed. The law requires that family prosecutors summon the victim and perpetrator of domestic violence for a conciliation hearing.(13) Although we understand that this reflects a general trend in Peru toward extrajudicial conflict resolution, we are concerned that the requirement that women accept the use of conciliation in domestic violence cases may be singularly inappropriate in a large number of cases. The fact that prosecutors assume a central role in conciliation communicates to the abuser, the victim, and the community at large that domestic violence constitutes a lesser offense.     In practice, conciliation sessions impose inappropriate obligations on the victims of violence, divert cases from prosecution, and delay victims' access to concrete remedies. The agreements reached in these sessions are rarely enforced, and non-compliance carries only a minimal penalty. In this context, many cases of domestic violence are not treated as they should be, as crimes that should be prosecuted and punished, but rather are mediated between the parties as if they were civil disputes between equal parties with legitimate competing claims.     Human Rights Watch has learned of agreements that included commitments by the victim of abuse to """"take responsibility for all domestic tasks"""" or """"agree to leave work and go directly to the house.""""(14) These obligations imply that the problem is not the violence, but rather the victim's behavior. This is entirely wrong. Women's rights activists and attorneys repeatedly complained that prosecutors prioritize family unity over the woman's safety and integrity. In every domestic violence case documented by Human Rights Watch in which prosecutors conducted a mandatory conciliation hearing, the women reported that they had been pressured by the prosecutor to preserve the relationship; in some cases, prosecutors explicitly condoned the abuse and urged the women to modify their behavior. For example, summoned by the prosecutor to a conciliation hearing, Irma Quispe's partner admitted to beating her but said this was because she was stubborn and had refused to obey him. The prosecutor then reprimanded Quispe, stating, """"So you're stubborn? You have to obey your husband. You have to do right by your children and improve.""""(15)   The mandatory conciliation requirement puts women at risk of long drawn out proceedings during which they receive little or no protection from further abuse. Further, the Family Violence Law allows prosecutors to reinitiate conciliation proceedings after they have been suspended because the victim had felt pressured or insecure or had expressed a desire to desist.(16) Thus, prosecutors can and do allow conciliation proceedings to drag on without providing protection measures for the victim in the meantime. These delays can result in dire consequences as in the case of Raquel García. The prosecutor summoned García's husband four times before he appeared for their first conciliation hearing. Then, despite García's appeal for a protection order to remove him from her house, the prosecutor instead made her husband sign an agreement not to hurt her anymore. Less than a month later, he assaulted her again, only for the prosecutor to summon both of them for another hearing more than a month later. The violence escalated following this summons: García's husband beat her severely, drenched both her and her bed in beer and water, and forced her to remain in such conditions throughout a cold night. The prosecutor set yet another hearing, García's husband failed to appear until the fourth summons, and once again the prosecutor drafted another conciliation agreement. When Human Rights Watch met García, she was living in a shelter, ever fearful of her husband's threats.(17)   Moreover, there is no meaningful punishment for failure to honor conciliation agreements. Breaches of such agreements generally go unpunished. After María Dominguez reported her husband for domestic abuse, for example, the family judge in Cono Norte facilitated a conciliation agreement in January 1998 under which her husband agreed to leave the house within two months. Yet when Human Rights Watch interviewed her nearly two years later, he was still living there and refusing to comply with the agreement.(18) Even when enforced, the law provides only minimal punishment for non-compliance with conciliation agreements. Prosecutors and judges can only cite defendants for contempt, which usually takes the form of a reprimand, rarely a fine, and never imprisonment.(19)   Human Rights Watch urges the Commission to do the following:  Ensure that all victims of domestic violence are protected under the Family Violence Law. The requirement that the man and woman involved be living in the same residence when the violence occurred should be eliminated. Include explicitly marital rape as a form of domestic violence. Specify explicitly, but not exhaustively, acts that constitute psychological violence apart from grave threats. This list should include, at a minimum, stalking and repeated harassment. Abolish the mandatory nature of conciliation procedures in domestic violence cases. If the procedure is to be preserved, it should be offered to victims as an option. Victims should have the benefit of free legal aid in making the decision to engage in conciliation over their other options. Eliminate the role of the prosecutor in conciliation. Ensure that those who remain authorized to conduct optional conciliation hearings in family-related matters (such as judges and Demunas personnel) receive thorough, rigorous, and continuous training in conflict resolution techniques. This training should also seek to eliminate gender bias among these practitioners. Establish effective mechanisms in the criminal law system for sanctioning non-compliance.      Addressing Problems with Implementation   Bias throughout the justice system against taking domestic violence seriously thwarts meaningful implementation of the Family Violence Law and compromises women's access to effective remedies and redress. There are four critical ways in which this bias is expressed. First, the police are often unresponsive or even hostile to women who report domestic violence. Second, forensic doctors in the Institute for Legal Medicine (IML, its Spanish acronym) frequently minimize injuries sustained in domestic violence incidents. Third, state prosecutors fail to duly investigate and prosecute domestic violence cases, preferring to hold mediation hearings even when the victim's life may be at risk. Because she cannot count on prosecutors to perform their duties, a victim must hire her own legal counsel to usher her case through the system if she wishes to see her batterer held accountable. Fourth, neither prosecutors nor judges make sufficient use of protection measures to shield women from future violence.   Police Procedures    Whether women can even begin to seek protection from their abusers depends crucially on the responsiveness and competence of the police. Most women report domestic violence to their local police station or a specialized women's police station.(20) The Family Violence Law stipulates that the police have the duty to investigate all reported cases of domestic violence, regardless of whether the victim pursues the charges and, at the request of the victim, can provide guarantees (protection) to safeguard her integrity.(21) The police are also empowered to search the home of the accused, in cases of delicto flagrante or when there is """"a very grave danger"""" of the commission of a crime. When the police apprehend perpetrators in the act of committing domestic abuse, they can detain them for up to twenty-four hours.(22)   Because filing a complaint with the police is the principle and first avenue for gaining access to the justice system, barriers at this stage can, and often do, deny women's access to redress. Human Rights Watch documented troubling deficiencies in the performance of the police. These include mistreatment of women filing complaints, inadequate investigations, unnecessary delays, and practices that jeopardize women's safety and physical and psychological integrity.   Virtually every case we investigated involved initial police rejection of the complaint. The women we interviewed said they encountered incredulity and abusive treatment when they attempted to report violence in their interpersonal relationships. This is particularly true for women reporting intimate partner rape. The ranking officer at the Lima Women's Police Station expressed his bias against such claims, saying """"When a woman reports this...the question remains, to what extent can we say it's rape between a couple...to what extent does a couple find [sexual] satisfaction through violence? It confuses us.""""(23)   Victims of psychological abuse and women's rights activists told Human Rights Watch that there is widespread reluctance to recognize and accept psychological violence as a real harm to be investigated. When police officers, often the first to hear reports of domestic violence, refuse to take psychological violence seriously, as in Altagracia Huamán's case, victims are effectively denied redress and protection. When Huamán tried to file a complaint for psychological abuse because her husband continued to stalk and threaten her after she moved out, the attending officer at the Chorrillos police station reportedly asked her, """"Why, are you crazy?"""" and refused to register her complaint.(24)   Many women we spoke with described more than one thwarted attempt to report domestic abuse, of all types, and to seek protection.(25) When the police do accept complaints, Human Rights Watch found that their investigations are usually limited to sending the victim to the forensic doctor, picking up the results, and summoning the assailant for an interview.   Police often require women to undergo a forensic examination before they can file an official complaint for domestic violence. Indeed, the ranking officer at the Lima Women's Police Station stated to Human Rights Watch that this is standard operating procedure: """"it is better to take the statement after the forensic exam [because] a lot of people come here in the heat of the moment.""""(26) This requirement has no grounding in law and imposes an undue delay in the process. The police are not required to accompany victims to the nearest forensic doctor or state health facility and rarely do so. In central Lima, the IML offices are just across the street from the women's police station. In many areas, however, women must travel significant distances to get their exam at the only IML office in the department or at a state-run health facility. Until a recent reform in early 2000, the police were required to pick up the medical certificates, which could take anywhere from five days to one month.(27) Now, the IML has adopted a welcome new policy of giving the certificates directly to victims.(28) While this will expedite the process, it does not resolve the problem of police refusal to take full statements before the examination. For example, if for whatever reason the victim fails to return to the police station with her certificate, there is no official record of her statement, and police do not pursue any investigation.   In those cases in which women do make formal statements, the police must summon the alleged aggressor to take his statement. We found that in some cases, the police gave the summonses directly to the victims to deliver to their abusers. This reflects a grossly negligent disregard for the victim's safety. Several of the women we interviewed said that their abusers responded to receiving the summons by inflicting another violent attack.(29)   Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the Commission:  Clarify the duty of the National Police to take and register a victim's complete, official statement immediately. No other step, such as the forensic examination, should be required before the statement is recorded. Require police officers to serve police, prosecutorial, and judicial summonses directly and promptly to perpetrators of domestic violence. Ensure that the National Police institute disciplinary measures or, if relevant, criminal proceedings against those police officers who refuse complaints, fail to act promptly, or mistreat victims. Clarify that the National Police must include, without delay, a required course on domestic violence in the Police Academy curriculum. This course should train police to conduct prompt, thorough, and respectful intakes of complaints.  Role of Forensic Doctors   The paramount importance of the forensic medical certificate in determining victims' ability to seek protection and redress merits special attention. Under Peruvian law physical domestic violence can be classified as either a misdemeanor or a felony offense.(30) It is unclear, due to the ambiguities in the law as to what constitutes psychological violence, what the parameters are for determining when psychological abuse constitutes a misdemeanor and when it rises to the level of a felony. The vast majority of domestic violence cases are classified as misdemeanors. The critical actors in this process are the medical examiners charged with conducting forensic examinations and quantifying injuries to legal effect. The medical certificate is often the only evidence to corroborate victims' testimonies. Human Rights Watch documented serious problems with the medicolegal system, including inadequate and incomplete examinations, which result in the minimization of injuries sustained in domestic violence situations. The lack of clarity on psychological violence has contributed to a situation in which forensic doctors cannot fulfill their designated role in assessing injury to legal effect in these cases.   The IML physicians conduct most forensic exams. The IML was created to ensure the Public Ministry could rely on a cadre of specialized, impartial forensic doctors. IML physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists should, in theory, be the best trained and most competent to diagnose injuries to legal effect. In areas where there are no IML facilities, physicians in state-run health centers, clinics, and hospitals conduct the forensic examinations. Private institutions may also issue medical certificates to legal effect but only if they have entered into a special agreement with the Public Ministry.(31) The Family Violence Law stipulates that all state-run facilities must issue the medical certificates free of charge to victims of domestic violence.(32)   Typically, the course a domestic violence complaint follows rests largely on the forensic doctor's diagnosis of the injuries.(33) Victims of domestic violence and women's rights attorneys and activists strongly alleged that physicians in the IML frequently minimized victims' injuries. As one attorney explained, """"There's enormous room for subjectivity, and they [forensic doctors] minimize them [the injuries]. I've seen it many times: they give more days for the same kind of injury when it's a 'normal' injury, not between family members. It's enough that it's a domestic violence injury for them to minimize it.""""(34) We spoke with women who had suffered serious violence at the hands of their intimate partners but whose access to redress was thwarted by questionable classification of their injuries. For example, Verónica Alvarez, a thirty-six-year-old mother of four, was hit in the face with a metal typewriter by her partner, leaving her permanently scarred, yet her case was classified as a misdemeanor because the forensic doctor in Arequipa classified her injuries as needing fewer than ten days of treatment and recuperation.(35) One prosecutor even told Human Rights Watch that, based on her experience with the IML, in domestic violence cases, """"none is a felony unless there is a broken bone.""""(36)   Diagnoses that are inconsistent with the injuries are the result, in part, of inadequate and incomplete examinations. Women reported that exams were often quick, cursory, and did not include basic tests and measurement of bruises and lacerations nor were photographs taken of their injuries. For example, Laura Alomar was beaten by her husband, thrown against the floor, repeatedly kicked, thrown against the wall, and hit in the breast with a hard object. She said that the forensic doctor who examined her did not ask her anything about her injuries and only looked over those that were plainly visible.(37) Moreover, supplementary exams, such as x-rays, that would significantly improve the quality of the medical evidence, can be difficult to obtain. The IML headquarters in central Lima, for example, did not have an x-ray machine or other basic diagnostic instruments and had to send victims to the Auxiliary Laboratory of the Central Morgue or a local hospital for additional, but in some cases essential, tests. There is some confusion as to whether these supplemental exams carry a fee. While the head of the IML, Doctor María del Carmen Contreras Marcovich, told Human Rights Watch that these are free for victims of domestic violence, as are the basic exams, a forensic doctor in the employ of the IML asserted that they did in fact carry a charge.(38) The result may be that fees are assessed for these supplemental exams, and women are either required to pay or simply do not get the tests because they cannot afford to do so. In 1996, when the basic physical exam carried a charge, our research indicated that many women never went to a forensic doctor because they had no money to do so.   Psychological evaluations, which could complement physical evidence and help provide a more complete diagnosis of the harm caused, are not routinely provided for women who lodge complaints of domestic violence. The IML may only conduct such evaluations when they are explicitly requested in a referral from a competent authority.(39) In fact, many women are not informed that they may receive both physical and psychological examinations. Hence, unless the referring authority requests a psychological examination, a victim of domestic abuse who is sent for a physical examination will not undergo any kind of psychological evaluation, effectively precluding the collection of additional evidence that could support her case.   Women seeking solely a psychological evaluation encounter another obstacle: the difficulty of translating psychological trauma into a quantifiable injury. Whereas physical injuries, at least theoretically, can be objectively assessed and classified according to the standard scale used in the Peruvian criminal justice system, the extent of psychological trauma is assessed using qualitative criteria. Human Rights Watch was told that many prosecutors in the Public Ministry are unwilling to accept psychological diagnoses as proof that domestic violence has occurred,(40) and an IML psychologist commented that judges """"want a calculation of the harm, [but] we cannot quantify the harm, because we use qualitative criteria.""""(41)   The end result is that most cases of domestic violence are officially classified as misdemeanors, and this has profound implications for the victim's ability to secure effective protection and redress. Under Peru's Criminal Procedural Code, misdemeanors fall within the jurisdiction of justices of the peace.(42) The Family Violence Law provides that all domestic violence claims should be screened initially by a prosecutor and then referred to the appropriate judicial authority, depending on whether the prosecutor deems the offense to constitute a misdemeanor or a felony.(43) In practice, however, police frequently bypass the prosecutor and refer cases directly to justices of the peace if they consider them to constitute misdemeanors. This is not an adequate or satisfactory system. The justices of the peace are often the only judicial authority in rural areas, yet they have very limited powers to provide protection or to punish perpetrators, whether in rural or urban areas. Justices of the peace cannot issue protection orders in misdemeanor cases, for example, and have limited powers to enforce any sentences that are imposed. While a justice of the peace may order an abuser to stay away from the victim, non-compliance can only be sanctioned as contempt of the court, punishable with a small fine or community service.   Even when abusers are prosecuted, misdemeanor offenses in domestic violence cases carry a maximum penalty of no more than twenty to thirty days' community service.(44) In fact, according to women's right activists, Public Ministry officials, and judges interviewed by Human Rights Watch, neither fines nor community service are generally leveled against perpetrators of domestic violence. Indeed, none of the battered women we interviewed reported that their abusers had been either fined or compelled to undertake community service.   Human Rights Watch urges the Commission to undertake the following:  Include in the Family Violence Law a clear delineation of responsibilities of forensic doctors in documenting domestic violence injuries. This should require the IML to improve on the current forms it uses and develop a standardized, comprehensive protocol, including information about domestic violence and clear guidelines for the collection of medical evidence and calculation of harm. The protocol should also include a detailed section on psychological violence. Ensure that the protocol is made available to the public and widely disseminated to all health care personnel. Include in Article 3 of the Family Violence Law specific actions the state should take to ensure that all employees in the IML and state health facilities are properly trained in the content of domestic violence legislation and procedures for collecting medical evidence. Ensure that all IML and state-employed physicians are aware of and abide by the cost exemption for all medical examinations related to cases of domestic violence, including psychological assessments. Call for mandatory periodic training of all justices of the peace on Peru's domestic violence legislation to ensure they understand their duty to sanction. This training should promote understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence and underscore that it cannot be excused, tolerated, or condoned under any circumstances.  Role of State Prosecutors    The strong tendency within the criminal justice system to perceive domestic violence as simply a minor offense is further reflected in the performance of state prosecutors. The Peruvian state has a clear legal obligation to investigate and prosecute in cases of domestic violence. Under the Family Violence Law, the National Police must register complaints of domestic violence and conduct preliminary investigations, and the Public Ministry must process the complaints and prosecute perpetrators. Yet Human Rights Watch found that victims of domestic violence cannot rely on the Public Ministry to pursue their cases. Women's rights activists, domestic violence attorneys, judges, government officials, and even prosecutors we spoke with all indicated that cases proceed through the legal system only when the victim has her own lawyer. The governmental Women's Human Rights Defender, Rocío Villanueva Flores, stated, """"In practice, if you don't have your own lawyer, your case won't get anywhere.""""(45)   The manner in which domestic violence complaints are processed effectively denies victims access to the state's prosecutorial machinery. First, domestic violence cases that are classified as misdemeanors are remanded directly to justices of the peace, bypassing the Public Ministry entirely. In these cases, women victims do not have the benefit of any legal counsel and must represent themselves in hearings. Second, when cases are directed to prosecutors, the emphasis on conciliation effectively denies women the right to effective judicial redress. As discussed above, prosecutors seek to resolve cases through mediated settlements rather than by prosecuting perpetrators of domestic violence. Finally, there are simply too few family prosecutors to deal with the high volume of domestic violence cases, while in some cases, there are """"mixed"""" prosecutors who must handle criminal, civil and family-related cases. The magnitude of the problem of domestic violence in Peru suggests the need to better equip the system to handle the increasing volume of cases.   Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the Commission:  Further clarify in the Family Violence Law the obligations of state prosecutors, both family and criminal, to actively pursue the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators of domestic violence. Recommend that the Public Ministry adopt and distribute national directives on how prosecutors should handle domestic violence complaints and conduct specific and periodic in-house training workshops.  Failure to Protect   The Peruvian justice system has the obligation not only to duly investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators, but also to protect victims of domestic violence. Indeed, the availability of immediate and effective protection measures is an essential element of state response to violence against women. Many women who report domestic violence are under constant threat or in imminent danger.(46) The Convention of Belém do Pará enshrines the right of victims of violence to rapid redress and stipulates that states should establish just and efficient legal procedures that include protection measures.(47) The inefficiency of these mechanisms in Peru has a direct impact on reporting, as women justifiably fear retaliation from their intimate partners, and effectively contributes to placing women's lives at risk. The Family Violence Law defines a role for both prosecutors and judges in providing this protection, which can include restraining orders and forced removal of the aggressor from the victim's home.(48) Human Rights Watch found, however, that implementation has so far been woefully inadequate.   All of the women's rights advocates and lawyers we spoke with concurred that neither prosecutors nor the competent members of the judiciary make adequate use of protection measures. In fact, Movimiento Manuela Ramos (MMR), a non-governmental organization that provides legal counsel to victims of domestic violence, found that prosecutors issued protective measures in only one out of forty-five domestic violence cases filed in Lima in 1996 and 1997.(49) While victims, technically, can petition judges directly for these orders--that is, if they are well versed in legal procedures, which the great majority are not--judges respond more favorably to cases initiated by state prosecutors. As one domestic violence attorney explained, """"Very few women can get a protective measure on their own directly from a judge.""""(50) In general, Human Rights Watch found that family judges are reluctant to order precautionary measures. One civil prosecutor reported that judges had often ruled out of order requests for immediate remedies that she had made, commenting, """"Some judges would limit themselves to declaring that violence had happened, but did not offer protection. Their attitude is 'better they [the victims] go to therapy.'""""(51) Part of the problem here may stem from the lack of training provided to family judges in addition to the fact that they do not have the power normally to provide remedies in cases involving violent assaults.   Our research confirmed the obstacles women face in securing protection from their violent intimate partners. In her own words, Raquel García """"begged"""" the prosecutor handling her case to make her husband leave the house, but the prosecutor simply required her husband to sign an agreement not to hurt her anymore rather than taking action to afford her effective protection.(52) In another case, protection measures were granted only with delay and then not enforced. A full two months after María Pérez sought protection against her husband because he physically abused her and habitually locked her in the house, a family judge ordered her husband to leave the house. Shortly thereafter, however, he returned and the abuse was renewed. Concerned neighbors finally reported the situation to the police; at the time of her interview with Human Rights Watch, Pérez had been living in a shelter for nearly six months to escape the abuse to which she had been subjected at her home.(53)   Human Rights Watch recommends that the Commission undertake the following:  Streamline the process for the issuance of protection orders and precautionary measures.  Ensure that all temporary protective orders are fully enforceable by the police. Require that all police stations, Demunas, IML offices, state health facilities, PROMUDEH offices, and all other appropriate agencies prominently post a list of victims' rights, including the range of protection measures available to them, written in accessible language.      1 This figure includes all victims who can report under the Family Violence Law, not only women.

The Criminal Code was modified in May 1999 to make the non-aggravated rape of females over fourteen years of age a public action crime: the state now has an obligation to prosecute. Before, the victim had to pursue private prosecution: she was named a party in the suit against the perpetrator, and had to hire an attorney to direct the prosecutorial investigation of the crime, develop the case, and present evidence against the accused in court. While the state always had the obligation to prosecute the rape of minors (under fourteen years of age) and aggravated rape, as of the modification, it has now assumed these obligations in rape where the victim is an adult woman, regardless of aggravating circumstances. Law No. 27115 of May 15, 1999.      10 As a result of the 1997 amendments, Article 29 of the Family Violence Law stipulates that all state health facilities must issue the forensic medical certificates in domestic violence cases free of charge. Law No. 27016, adopted in December 1998, further modified Article 29 of the Family Violence Law to clearly state that the exam itself is free, and to mention specific health care facilities that are under the obligation to conduct the exams and issue the certificates free of charge and to legal effect in cases of domestic violence.

Rather, it defers to the Criminal Code of Peru for the definition of misdemeanor and felony assault, as well as for the respective penalties. The Criminal Code establishes a system whereby assaults are classified according to the number of days resulting injuries require for treatment and disability leave. Intentional injuries requiring ten days or fewer are categorized as misdemeanors (Book III, Title II, Article 441); those requiring more than ten but fewer than thirty days are simple felonies (Book II, Title I, Chapter III, Article 122); and those requiring more than thirty days, causing permanent mutilation, disfigurement, or incapacity or placing the victim's life in imminent danger, are classified as aggravated felonies (Book II, Title I, Chapter III, Article 121). The code was modified in 1997 to stipulate that misdemeanor offenses can rise to the level of felony when the injuries are sustained in domestic violence. The modification leaves this determination to the discretion of the judge (Book III, Title II, Article 441).      31 Family Violence Law, Article 29.      32 Most IML examinations carry a fee. The exceptions are the following: 1) domestic violence cases; 2) minors; and 3) when requested by a prosecutor or judge.

Prosecutors can dictate protection orders (medidas de protección), while only judges can issue precautionary measures (medidas cautelares). In concrete terms, the range of measures available to each is the same; the difference is that traditionally, only judges have had the authority to issue these kinds of injunctions and then, usually only once a case has reached the court. The Family Violence Law gives prosecutors the ability to issue these protection orders, but he or she must seek confirmation by the appropriate judge once the order is issued. Because they are in effect the same thing, in this document we use the term """"protective order"""" or """"protection order"""" to refer to both.      49 MMR, La Violencia contra la Mujer (Violence against Women), pp.70-71.      50 Human Rights Watch interview, Grecia Rojas, attorney, Flora Tristán Women's Center, Lima, October 28, 1996.      51 Human Rights Watch telephone interview, anonymous civil prosecutor, Lima, September 22 and 25, 1997.      52 Human Rights Watch interview, Raquel García, Lima, October 27, 1996.      53 Human Rights Watch interview, María Pérez, Lima, December 11, 1999.","Americas, Peru","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence"

We consider this review to be both important and timely. We have therefore prepared the attached memorandum, which details our concerns on this issue and sets out a series of recommendations to help your Commission in its critical review and final recommendations. As you may know, Human Rights Watch is an independent monitoring organization established in 1978, which conducts regular, systematic investigations of human rights abuses in some seventy countries around the world. The Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch was created in 1990 to document state-sponsored or state-tolerated violence against women and sex discrimination.  As part of this work, Human Rights Watch has been monitoring the state's response to domestic violence in Peru for over three years. In this connection, we have conducted two missions to Peru, in October-November 1996 and in December 1999. On both occasions, researchers from the Women's Rights Division interviewed women's rights advocates, community activists, domestic violence shelter personnel, social workers, and private attorneys who represent victims of domestic violence. We also spoke with individuals from the Peruvian National Police, the Institute for Legal Medicine, the Ministry of Justice, the Public Ministry, the People's Defender's Office, and the judiciary. In addition, we collected testimonies from twenty-five women victims of domestic abuse. While the majority of the interviews were conducted in Lima, we also documented domestic violence cases in Tarapoto, Department of San Martín. Our research, and the attached memorandum, focus on violence against women in their interpersonal relationships. We do not address the whole range of situations covered by the Family Violence Law. In the course of our investigations, we found that Peru is not fulfilling its international human rights obligations to protect women from domestic violence and to establish effective legal measures to remedy these violations. This is due both to problems embedded in the Family Violence Law and to its implementation. In the first instance, the law adopts an incomplete definition of family violence that excludes whole groups of women; fails to proscribe explicitly certain kinds of violence, such as marital rape; and fails to specify acts constitutive of psychological abuse. Furthermore, the law makes conciliation a mandatory step for women who report domestic violence. Second, Human Rights Watch found that, in practice, implementation of the law is seriously deficient and that there is compelling evidence that bias against victims of domestic violence pervades the justice system. We received many complaints that, when called upon to respond to instances of violence against women, the police, medical examiners, prosecutors and judges frequently fail to take domestic violence seriously, and effectively obstruct women's access to redress. In adopting the Family Violence Law in 1993, and amending it in 1997, the Peruvian government recognized domestic violence as a widespread problem of public magnitude in Peru. Yet, deficiencies in the law and its flawed implementation mean that the problem remains acute. Indeed, every step in the system that obstructs or delays women's access to redress or reinforces women's subordinate status within interpersonal relationships serves only to ensure that the violence will continue. Now, through the attention being devoted to domestic violence by your Commission, Congress has a new and vital opportunity to ensure that Peruvian women are afforded all possible protection and remedy against domestic violence and that Peru lives up to its obligations under international human rights law to properly investigate and prosecute instances of domestic violence and to provide effective remedies for victims.  We thank you for your consideration. We look forward to further opportunities to discuss our findings and to contribute to the efforts of the Peruvian government and civil society to respond meaningfully and effectively to domestic violence against women.

Human Rights Watch has registered twenty-seven cases of harrasment against journalists in Angola in the last twelve months. Journalist and human rights activist Rafael Marques was convicted today by an Angolan court for defamation of the President. The trial was marred by serious procedural irregularities, such as the violation of Marques' right of defense. Marques was sentenced to six months in prison, but his lawyers paid a bond to keep him out of jail pending appeal before the Supreme Court. """"Marques' conviction is clearly part of an ongoing trend, and we're extremely concerned about this,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. Two other journalists—the director of the Agora newspaper, Aguiar dos Santos, and the editor of Agora, Antonio Freitas—were also on trial. Another journalist, Andre Domingos Mussamo, was released on bail in mid-March after being held in detention in the Angolan province of Cuanza Norte for over three months despite the expiry of two release deadlines. Mussamo is accused of stealing documents from the provincial government headquarters and of violating state secrets because of an unpublished article written by him. The article made reference to a letter from the provincial governor to President Eduardo dos Santos. He was detained on December 2, 1999. The law under which Mussamo is being held is the Law of Crimes against State Security, which was technically revoked by the new Constitution adopted in 1991. """"President dos Santos told us a few years ago that in Angola, ‘there is more freedom of the press than anywhere,'"""" said Takirambudde. """"But we see no sign of this press freedom and the Angolan government is isolated internationally on this issue. This is very disappointing."""" Takirambudde noted that the European Parliament recently made a declaration condemning infringements on press freedom in Angola, and the U.S. government and European Union have recently issued demarches on the subject.","Africa, Angola",""

Russia's brutal conduct in the war in Chechnya is currently being debated at the United Nations Commission for Human Rights in Geneva, and will be the topic of a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe convening on Monday in Strasbourg. """"The debates in Geneva and Strasbourg must produce resolutions on Chechnya that hold Russia accountable for the crimes its forces have committed there,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Without a credible system for accountability, there is no reason to think these kinds of crimes will stop.""""  On February 6, as many as 3,000 Chechen fighters arrived in Gekhi-Chu en route to the mountains. At about 7:00 a.m. the next day, Russian forces bombed the village intensively with artillery, warplanes, and helicopters for several hours. Russian contract soldiers entered the village at about 1:00 p.m. and ordered civilians from their cellars-where they had sought shelter from the bombardment-ostensibly to check their documents. Witnesses stated that the Chechen fighters had left Gekhi-Chu by dawn on February 7. However, the presence of such large numbers of fighters in a densely populated village exposed the civilian inhabitants to grave danger. Human Rights Watch condemned the Chechen fighters for this violation of international humanitarian law. Magomed (53) described to Human Rights Watch how he and his two sons, Musa (21) and Ruslan (25) were ordered out of a cellar on Tsentralnaia Street at gunpoint by Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs troops (OMON). According to Magomed, OMON immediately took the two brothers aside, and forced them to strip to the waist and stand with their hands above their heads. Magomed told Human Rights Watch that he was standing about thirty meters away and saw what he believed was the summary execution of four young men, Adlan Israilov (32), Aslambek Israilov (28), Turpal Israilov (about 22), and Alik (about 20). Magomed said:  The Russians took out four men from another cellar and shot them; I saw the soldiers shoot but couldn't see at whom; there was a wall in the way. After the shooting, the soldiers who fired came over to us and took my sons and five other men away.  The father of three of the men who were executed, Uvais Israilov (70), went with Magomed to see the bodies of the four dead men. He told Human Rights Watch: When we arrived we saw four bodies lying in a row . . . The four were shot in the back of the head at point blank range; there were burn marks on their hair. Each had identical bullet entrance wounds, but different exit wounds. Magomed moved on to another street, but when he returned, a local woman, Zurat, told him that some men had been executed in her cowshed on Tsentralnaia Street. Magomed told Human Rights Watch he saw there the bodies of his younger son, Musa, and of a refugee whose name he did not know. Musa had been shot in the ear; the other man had been shot in the back of the head, with the bullet exiting through the cheek, and had been wounded in the arm. The men's boots and woolen socks had been removed. Magomed stated that his elder son, Ruslan, had been seriously wounded by a shot in the back and left for dead. A female relative, Petimat (41), told Human Rights Watch that two fingers on Ruslan's left hand were missing. She believes he was shot from behind with his hands behind his back and that his fingers prevented the bullet from penetrating his head. She stated that the soldiers also shot Ruslan in the back, shattering his collar bone and that, like the other victims, his boots and socks had been removed. A local doctor treated his wounds later that day. Ruslan's current whereabouts are unknown. Magomed told Human Rights Watch that he was unable to bury the bodies since there was nobody to wash and prepare them for proper burial. The following day, at about 9:00 a.m., he returned to the cowshed only to discover Russian troops loading the two corpses onto a tank. He approached them and said, """"Give me back my son."""" He then offered one of the soldiers, who was about 35 and had the emblem of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on his uniform, 400 rubles for his son's body. The soldier took the money, and the soldiers helped to unload the body of Musa and the other execution victim. Magomed stated that the commanding officer was about 45 and was dressed in a Russian army uniform. Russian snipers shot indiscriminately at civilians in Gekhi-Chu. Witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch alleged that snipers killed at least seven men. Human Rights Watch confirmed two such killings and the serious wounding of a thirty-two-year-old woman. Aishad Makhajiyeva (38) described to Human Rights Watch how on February 7 a sniper shot her sister, Almat (32), in the head just after the shelling began. The bullet passed straight through the upper part of her brain and exited on the upper side of her head, toward the rear. Although conscious, Almat is paralyzed on the left side of her body and has difficulty speaking. She is currently convalescing in hospital in Nazran, Ingushetia.  Alkhazur Khuliev (57), described how on February 7 a Russian sniper shot dead an elderly villager, believed to be Naskho Visaitov (about 70). He told Human Rights Watch: """"A sniper was standing about three meters from me . . . I heard him shout, 'I'll get him' [ya ego vedu] . . . I saw him shoot an old man . . . who was about one hundred meters away."""" The sniper, about 35 years old, was wearing a military uniform. Sultan Kataev (59) stated that his uncle, Adlan Miev, (about 70) was shot by a sniper on February 6 in the chest and leg. Miev died of his wounds two days later in a hospital in the town of Urus-Martan.  The eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch all described in detail how soldiers returned repeatedly to the village to loot it, carting away livestock, electronic goods, carpets, clothes and other items of value.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

The E.U. should be trying to promote civil society groups in Africa, not helping governments to silence them,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa of Human Rights Watch. He urged the E.U. to increase its aid to civil society organizations so that they have the necessary resources to continue their work. In a letter addressed to the prime ministers of the European Union member states, Human Rights Watch also called on the E.U. to shine a spotlight on widespread human rights violations in Africa and take concrete steps to end impunity for such abuses. The organization urged the E.U. to make support and strengthening of civil society a key element of the Cairo Summit and its action plan. A copy of the letter can be found at https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/03/euletter0331.htm Key recommendations about E.U. policy toward Africa include: In order to end impunity, leaders on all sides in the Great Lakes who were responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity must be brought to justice. The E.U. and its member states should support the creation of an international jurisdiction to try cases from Burundi, the DRC, and Rwanda since 1994, which would reinforce the impact of judgments from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).  The E.U. and its member states should energetically denounce violations of human rights and humanitarian law by all parties involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including Rwanda and Uganda, and insist upon accountability for the perpetrators. Close scrutiny of the E.U.'s economic assistance to all the states involved in the conflict should continue to ensure that funds earmarked for social and economic development programs do not end up in the war chests of the belligerents. The E.U. and its member states should call for a U.N. embargo on the sale and transfer of arms to the region, and to governments with troops in the DRC. Any assistance to the military or police by E.U. member states to Nigeria should be carefully tailored to ensure that it cannot be used to benefit officers who have been responsible for human rights violations or in situations where human rights violations are likely. The E.U. and its member states should express its grave concern about recent incidents in which soldiers have fired indiscriminately on civilians during disturbances in Kaduna and elsewhere over the introduction of Sharia or in the oil-producing regions of the Niger Delta. The E.U. and its member states should make clear to the Nigerian government that any attempt to resolve the crisis in the Niger Delta, where there is serious discontent about the terms of oil production, in a way that does not respect the rights of those who live in the oil-producing regions is unacceptable. The E.U. and its member states should use all possible means to pressure the rebels in Sierra Leone to cease their attacks on civilians, to release all abductees, and to allow for full access by humanitarian organizations. The E.U. and its member states should support the operation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with a strong investigative component as required by the Lomé accord, and support the rebuilding of the judicial system.  The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty provides the best framework for the total eradication of antipersonnel mines, including their clearance.

The Indonesian government has given the refugees, some 100,000 people, until the end of the month to choose whether to go back to East Timor or remain in Indonesia. Indonesia says it will end all delivery of food and other assistance as of March 31. """"Everyone wants a quick resolution of the refugee crisis, but this ultimatum is counterproductive,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The threatened deadline alone has created panic. If it is implemented, the cutoff will directly endanger the lives of tens of thousands of refugees without solving the underlying problems.""""  Conditions for many of the refugees are already dire. There have been food shortages, along with health and nutrition problems in many of the camps. Some reports estimate that as many as 500 refugees have died from stomach and respiratory ailments. Refugees also continue to face significant obstacles in deciding whether to return. In some areas, refugees continue to be subjected to intimidation by armed militias and disinformation campaigns. Refugees are told that conditions in East Timor are worse than in the camps, and that the United Nations is acting as a new colonial occupying force. Other refugees opposed independence for East Timor, or come from militia or army families, and fear vigilante justice should they return to East Timor.  Indonesian officials claim, however, that they can no longer afford to feed the refugees, that food aid acts as a magnet and prevents refugees in West Timor from returning home permanently, claiming that after March 31, the refugees should be the sole responsibility of the international community.  """"Given Indonesia's economic woes, the call for international financial support in feeding and caring for the refugees is understandable. We call on donors to make urgently needed assistance available. But an artificial deadline helps no one,"""" said Saunders. """"Thousands of refugees are not now in a position to make a free and informed choice about whether to return. A large part of the problem has been Indonesia's failure to create conditions in which refugees can make a genuine choice."""" According to aid agencies, the total number of refugees currently in West Timor is just under 100,000. Precise figures are not available because access to the camps and settlements has been limited by harassment and intimidation of humanitarian aid workers by pro-Indonesian militias still dominant in a number of the camps. Many refugees have also been subjected to months of disinformation and, often, intimidation by members of the pro-Indonesian militias. Indonesia has recently made some progress in combating the intimidation in the camps, but lack of security and reliable information continue to be important obstacles to return. Aid workers in West Timor estimate that one-half to two-thirds of the refugees, if given a free choice, would eventually choose to return to East Timor. """"Withdrawal of food aid and other humanitarian assistance should never be used as a means to pressure refugees into returning home prematurely"""" said Saunders. """"Return should be voluntary and based on the free and informed choice of the refugees themselves.""""  Following the announcement by the United Nations on September 4, 1999 that nearly eighty percent of East Timorese voters had rejected continued rule by Indonesia, East Timor was the site of orchestrated mayhem. In the days and weeks following the announcement, an estimated seventy percent of homes and buildings across East Timor were destroyed, more than two-thirds of the population was displaced, and an estimated 250,000 East Timorese fled or were forcibly taken, often at gunpoint, across the border into Indonesian West Timor. To date, roughly 150,000 refugees have returned to East Timor.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/29/letter-european-union-ministers","Letter to European Union Ministers","Letter to European Union Ministers","","03/29/2000","In a letter addressed to the prime ministers of the European Union member states, Human Rights Watch  called on the E.U. to shine a spotlight on widespread human rights violations in Africa and take concrete steps to end impunity for such abuses. Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. and its member states to take effective steps that would ensure coherence and integration of human rights concerns and commitments into its Common Foreign and Security Policy and its external relations, including development cooperation. Such a strategy calls for incorporating specific policies to address issues of human rights, accountability and the rule of law in Africa, and to use E.U. cooperation agreements and diplomatic activity to further these goals. Programs designed to support and strengthen civil society, including African human rights organizations, should receive particular attention. Robust public and private diplomacy to protest human rights violations by governments or rebel groups is an essential component of this strategy. Effective and transparent implementation mechanisms must be attached to such enhanced E.U. efforts on behalf of existing E.U. human rights and development policies and commitments. The following memorandum reflects some of the principal concerns about E.U. policy toward Africa from the work of Human Rights Watch, but does not discuss every country where we work or every issue of importance.  Support for Civil Society The emergence of a vibrant civil society is among the most important developments sweeping the continent, yet it remains precarious and vulnerable in many countries. We were therefore alarmed to learn that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) prohibited the Civil Society Forum sponsored by the North-South Center from taking place prior to the opening of the Summit in Cairo. Although the forum will be held in Lisbon, its significance and potential impact on the E.U.-Africa Summit has been drastically reduced.  The E.U. and its member states should strongly protest this attempt to silence civil society groups in Africa, and firmly commit to raise support and strengthening of civil society in Africa at the Summit and in its action plan. The E.U. should give visible, high-profile support to efforts by organizations of civil society to promote human rights standards and monitor their governments' compliance. The E.U. should develop transparent mechanisms to regularly monitor and protest attacks on civil society activists, and instruct its representatives in Africa to work with other international actors to create a network to protect activists in danger. We also urge the E.U. to increase its aid to civil society organizations so that they have the necessary resources to continue their work. Prevention of War Crimes, Crimes Against Humanity and Genocide Nowhere is the need for justice and accountability more apparent than in the Great Lakes crisis. Given the interlinked nature of these conflicts -- the past slaughter of Hutu refugees in the DRC and the current fear and hatred between those identified with Tutsi and those identified with Hutu in the Kivu provinces of the DRC, the possibility of future threats against the government of Rwanda, and the ethnic killing in Burundi -- the E.U. and its member states must show that genocide and crimes against humanity will be punished no matter where or by whom they are committed. To leave allegations of such crimes unaddressed in any part of this region will undermine the potential deterrent effect of judgments by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).  Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. and its member states to support the creation of an international jurisdiction to try cases from Burundi, the DRC, and Rwanda since 1994, which would reinforce the impact of judgments from the ICTR. Given the present work load as well as the troubled administrative history of the ICTR, it would be best to establish separate but coordinating divisions, with their own administration, prosecution, and trial chamber. They should be structured in such a way as to benefit from the existing jurisprudence created by the ICTR and with recourse to the same appeals chamber. Like the International Criminal Tribunal for Ex-Yugoslavia, these tribunals should have no fixed date for the end of their mandates. By creating a jurisdiction able to prosecute crimes not yet committed as well as those of the past, the international community would deliver a clear warning to extremists of all kinds who might otherwise be tempted to organize ethnic violence in order to disrupt any peace accords. At the same time, we urge the E.U. and its member states to increase and ameliorate support for independent national judiciaries in Africa. In the long term, defense of human rights and the rule of law will be best assured by credible and independent institutions of justice. However, such assistance should not simply target government programs, but must also aim to enhance nongovernmental capacities in the justice arena.  Child Soldiers The use of hundreds of thousands of children as soldiers worldwide is a global crises that demands continued international attention, especially in Africa. Recently, two milestones in the effort to end this appalling practice have been achieved: the entry into force of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in November of 1999, and the agreement by a working group in January on a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts. The Charter is the first regional treaty to prohibit any recruitment or participation in hostilities of children under the age of eighteen. We urge all E.U. and OAU member states to swiftly sign, ratify and implement the new child soldiers protocol after its formal adoption by the General Assembly, and to also declare a minimum age of at least eighteen for voluntary recruitment. We also urge all OAU member states that have not already done so to ratify the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In addition, we urge cooperation among states to ensure that children who have been used as soldiers are swiftly demobilized and receive support for their rehabilitation and social reintegration. Land Mines The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty provide the best framework for the total eradication of antipersonnel mines, including their clearance. We call on the E.U. to work for universalization of this important agreement. The E.U. should urge the nine OAU member states that have not yet signed the ban treaty to do so now (CAR, Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, DR Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Nigeria, Libya, Somalia). The E.U. should urge the twenty-one OAU member states that have signed but not ratified the Mine Ban Treaty to ratify immediately (Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Rwanda, Sao Tome, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia). The E.U. should also work to ensure that Finland, the only E.U. member state that has not yet joined the Mine Ban Treaty, signs the ban treaty now. The E.U. should also work to ensure that Greece, the only E.U. member state that has signed but not ratified the Mine Ban Treaty, ratifies the ban treaty now. Refugee Protection Human Rights Watch is very concerned that the E.U. and its member states should take all necessary measures to secure the civilian and humanitarian nature of refugee camps. Efforts should be made to disarm and separate combatants from civilians refugees; to exclude from international protection those individuals suspected of having committed crimes against humanity or war crimes, with a view to investigate and prosecute where appropriate in accordance with international standards; and to preserve the civilian and humanitarian institution of asylum. The E.U. and its member states should provide appropriate assistance to governments and to international humanitarian agencies, such as UNHCR, to carry out these tasks and to guarantee the security of humanitarian staff. Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned about those who have become refugees as a result of their human rights work. Human rights defenders in the Great Lakes region often face severe persecution aimed at silencing them for documenting and speaking out against human rights violations. We are particularly concerned about Congolese human rights defenders who are working in eastern Congo and have investigated human rights abuses by both Kabila's government during the 1996-97 war and the rebel RCD which took over the region in August 1998. Many activists, fearing for their lives at the hands of the rebels, have fled to neighboring countries; many have been unable to find safe asylum in these countries. The E.U. and its member states should urge UNHCR in neighbouring countries to guarantee the safety and protection of human rights defenders seeking asylum who may face grave danger. Angola Angola returned to all-out war in December 1998. The human cost of the war in 1999 was impossible to determine, but it is estimated that more than 2.1 million people had been displaced. Both the government and the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), were responsible for appalling levels of death and destruction.  Human Rights Watch welcomes the report by Canada's ambassador to the U.N., Robert Fowler, chair of the Angola Sanctions Committee. From 1993 until January 1999, despite the introduction of three packages of sanctions against UNITA, the U.N. largely turned a blind eye to their violation. Following the appointment of Robert Fowler as chair, the Sanctions Committee has become much more active, producing three reports with detailed recommendations. The challenge is now to see the panel's recommendations enacted, such as ensuring that compliance with U.N. sanctions regimes be among the criteria considered by the E.U. when evaluating candidates for new membership (aimed at Bulgaria especially), and that candidacies of nationals from offending countries should not be supported for senior positions within the U.N. and international organizations should be discouraged from holding conferences and meetings in listed countries (a recommendation aimed at Togo, which is an incoming chair of the Organization of African Unity). The E.U. should work with the Security Council to support an arms embargo on Angola, applicable to both the government and UNITA. The E.U. has played a supportive role in the Angolan peace process but lacked the leverage of the United States. Portugal, the former colonial power and a member with Russia and the U.S. of the """"Troika"""" monitors in the peace process, continues to play an important role but, disappointingly, has not been active in pressing rights issues. The E.U. has issued a number of communiques which included condemnations of human rights abuses by both sides, and we urge the E.U. to continue denouncing such abuses publicly.  Burundi In September 1999, Burundian authorities abruptly ordered some 350,000 residents of the province of Bujumbura-rurale to move into regroupment sites, purportedly to reduce Hutu support for the rebel groups and to slow their advance on the capital. They acted also to quiet growing restiveness among extremist Tutsi who were accusing Buyoya's government of inaction before the insurgent threat. Soldiers have been responsible for killing civilians in the course of operations against rebels around the capital. Insurgents too, representing several different factions, have also slaughtered civilians. More than one hundred thousand civilians have been slain in Burundi, both by Hutu and by Tutsi. Many of these killings are crimes against humanity and some have been described as genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry. They must be prosecuted promptly and effectively by an international tribunal as well as by Burundian courts. Some Burundians and foreign observers now propose yet another international investigation as well as a Burundian Truth and Reconciliation commission. Such commissions may add greater detail to what is already known of this tragic past, but they serve a different purpose from that of prosecutions and must not become a pretext for delaying them. In order to end impunity, leaders on all sides who were responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity must be brought to justice, using Burundian national courts as well as an international tribunal. The E.U. should support an extension of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to include prosecution of such crimes. As an immediate priority, the E.U. and its member states should press delegates to the Arusha talks to request this extention in the final accords for ending the war in Burundi. The majority of cases now pending would be judged in Burundian courts. Given the current limitations in number and resources of these courts, the E.U. should begin preparing the assistance that will be needed for them to function effectively and according to due process. To remedy the shortage of judicial personnel, the E.U. and its members states should assist in the intensive training of new staff. Such training should also be seen as an opportunity to integrate greater numbers of Hutu into the judicial system, a move which would help make judicial decisions more credible in the eyes of Hutu. The E.U. should also press Burundian authorities to accept the help of foreign jurists who could serve as judges, assessors, and prosecutors in these trials, just as they are now serving as lawyers for the defense. Donor governments, including the E.U., have denounced violence against civilians and the regroupment policy and called for investigations into the worst massacres. In September, the E.U. urged the U.N. human rights operation to assist in investigating the August massacres reportedly perpetrated by Burundian soldiers. Human Rights Watch welcomes the E.U.'s calls for such investigations in Burundi and urges the E.U. to respond publicly to reports of massacres and support investigations into such abuses. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) The DRC conflict continues to present the biggest security crisis in the continent, contributing to the worsening of the humanitarian situation in much of central and southern Africa. The principal belligerents signed a shaky peace pact in Lusaka, Zambia, on July 14, that competing rebel factions later joined, but there are few illusions that progress towards implementation of the Lusaka pact will be anything other than slow and painful. Since the signing of the Lusaka agreement, inhabitants of rural areas in north and south Kivu have complained about the intensification of attacks by Hutu rebels on their villages. At the same time, the rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) and members of the Rwandan and Ugandan militaries backing them developed a pattern of reprisal attacks on civilians whenever their soldiers came under fire from the Hutu rebels or the Mai-Mai. Caught in the crossfire, hundreds of thousands of civilians in eastern Congo are forced to flee their homes to district and provincial capitals of the Kivus, and even to seek asylum in neighboring countries. The generalized insecurity has set the scene for a likely social explosion in the near future.  Forces of the RCD on several occasions have massacred scores of civilians. Human Rights Watch recently spoke to survivors of an attack which took place on February 5 in the village of Kilambo in north Kivu. According to witnesses, Kilambo was first attacked in last week of January by a group of Hutu rebels believed to be Interahamwe. The attackers raped, looted and killed many villagers. When the RCD rebels arrived, they also killed and looted the villagers, accusing them of sympathizing with the Hutu rebels. In South Kivu, over the 1998-99 New Year, the RCD massacred up to 500 civilians in and around the village of Makabola; other mass killings of civilians by the Hutu fighters and RCD forces took place throughout the year. The RCD repeatedly promised to investigate these and other similar incidents, and to punish perpetrators, but failed to deliver on such promises. A breakaway faction of the RCD headed by Prof. Wamba dia Wamba claims to control, with the backing of Uganda, northeastern areas of the Congo along the border with Uganda. The presence of the rebels and their Ugandan backers, an increased availability of small firearms, and the emergence of an alarmingly exclusive ethnic ideology, were contributing factors in the deadly escalation of a localized interethnic conflict between the pastoralist Hema and agriculturalist Lendu tribesmen. Triggered by long-standing disputes over land rights in mid-June 1999, humanitarian sources reported that by mid-October the conflict had resulted in the displacement of over 100,000 people, and up to 5,000 to 7,000 killings. Both the Kabila government and the rebels stepped up their harassment of Congolese human rights defenders and civil society activists. The Kabila government's attempts to intimidate the political opposition, the press, and the country's dynamic civil society and human rights movement led to severe restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association. The government made cosmetic concessions to an ever-retreating democratization agenda. Its Court of Military Order sent to the firing squads scores of soldiers and civilians convicted of disciplinary and a variety of criminal offenses after trials that lacked both in due process and venues of appeal. The RCD cracks down on dissenting voices in areas under their control in much the same way as the government does by seeking to intimidate opinion leaders through detention, harsh and degrading treatment, and travel restrictions. Provided that the belligerent parties themselves respected their own accord, the E.U. pledged in several public statements support for its implementation, particularly in the areas of resettling civilians displaced by the war, fostering national reconciliation in the DRC, and supporting the country's rehabilitation plans. In June 1999 the European Commission issued a communication to the E.U. Council of Ministers and Parliament reviewing the E.U.'s economic cooperation with countries at war in the DRC. The report was intended to avoid the misuse of development funds provided by the E.U. for military purposes. Also in June a presidential declaration expressed concern at the continuing flow of arms and military equipment to the Great Lakes and Central Africa regions. The statement called on member states to strictly adhere by the E.U.'s own Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and recalled that, under the E.U. code, countries agree not to authorize arms exports that might """"aggravate existing tensions or armed conflicts in the country of final destination"""" or risk fueling human rights abuses. The E.U. and its member states should energetically denounce violations of human rights and humanitarian law by all parties involved in the DRC war, including Rwanda and Uganda, and insist upon accountability for the perpetrators. Strong and constant pressure should be exerted on all foreign countries involved in the war in the Congo as well as the Congolese government to observe their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law. The E.U. and its member states should insist that the U.N. complete a prompt and thorough investigation of charges of violations of international humanitarian law against all parties, and support the creation of a separate chamber for the DRC of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to prosecute such crimes. Close scrutiny of the E.U.'s economic assistance to all the states involved in the conflict should continue to ensure that funds earmarked for social and economic development programs do not end up in the war chests of the belligerents. The E.U. and its member states should call for a embargo on the sale and transfer of arms to the region, and to governments with troops in the DRC. The E.U. and its member states should extend technical and financial assistance to the process of inter-Congolese dialogue after ensuring that the process in all its phases is transparent and accessible to all stake holders, namely the government, the rebel factions, the unarmed opposition and civil society. Nigeria The inauguration on May 29 of the first civilian government for 16 years in Nigeria offers a real hope that the country can take its rightful place as a leader of the African continent and that its citizens can enjoy the respect for human rights to which they are entitled. Nevertheless, serious concerns remain, including defects in the electoral process and the lack of a democratically drafted constitution, as well as the heritage of military rule; in particular, ongoing security force abuses. In recent months, ethnic and religious tensions have led to clashes in which hundreds of people have died, threatening the stability of the state. The federal government has failed to show leadership in attempts to solve these problems, and to insist that the rights of Nigerians must be respected by state governments and by the security forces.  The E.U. and its member states can play an important role in supporting legal and practical reforms by the Nigerian government through technical assistance and diplomatic pressure, and by assisting civil society organizations working towards increased respect for human rights. Any military assistance from the EU or its member states to the Nigerian military should be carefully tailored to ensure that it cannot be used to benefit officers who have been responsible for human rights violations or in situations where human rights violations are likely. The E.U. should also express its grave concern about recent incidents in which soldiers have fired indiscriminately on civilians during disturbances in Kaduna and elsewhere over the introduction of sharia, or in the oil producing regions of the Niger Delta. EU countries have major investments in the Nigerian oil industry. It is therefore especially important that the EU and make clear to the Nigerian government that any attempt to resolve the crisis in the Niger Delta, where there is serious discontent at the terms of oil production, in a way that does not respect the rights of those who live in the oil producing regions is unacceptable. In particular, the EU should protest the use of the army to raze the village of Odi, Bayelsa State, in November 1999. Equally, the E.U. should insist to the multinational oil companies working in Nigeria that they must play their part in ensuring that oil production does not continue only due to the threat or actual use of force against those who protest their activities.  Rwanda The Rwandan government is fighting an active war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and facing the possible renewal of serious violence in northwestern Rwanda where attacks by insurgents in December 1999 and early January broke a period of relative calm that had lasted for several months. In both arenas, Rwandan troops are reported to have committed serious abuses against civilians. In 1999, the Rwandan authorities imposed a program of forced villagization on the people of northwestern Rwanda. Originally implemented in the eastern part of the country in an effort to provide land for the hundreds of thousands of Rwandans who returned from exile following the RPF victory, this program was transferred to the northwest with a different purpose, that of contributing to security in a region threatened by insurgency. Local officials, sometimes backed by military or police, have insisted that people destroy their homes and move to government-designated sites where they have been obliged to live in shelters of wood and leaves, perhaps covered with a piece of plastic, until they find the resources to construct a new home. Naturally the weak, particularly widows, the elderly, and minors heading households, have the hardest time in building new homes for themselves. The government has argued that this program will permit the easier delivery of services, but in fact few of the sites provide any services at all and many residents are now farther from their fields, sources of water, schools, churches, health centers, and markets than they were before. Some who have resisted destroying their homes have been fined, jailed or threatened with physical harm by the authorities. Some 130,000 persons remain imprisoned on charges of genocide, while fewer than 4,000 have been brought to trial. Rwandan prosecutors and judicial police undertook a major initiative to prepare dossiers for the tens of thousands of persons whose cases had never been investigated in order to comply with a December 31, 1999 deadline for completing this work. As of late January, some 34,000 persons still had not yet been investigated and the National Assembly had passed a law again extending the time period during which people could be held without formal charges. The slow progress of trials, understandable at first because of the enormous difficulties of organizing a new judicial system, now has no such justification, given the very significant amount of funds and technical assistance that has been delivered to the Rwandan ministry of justice. The Rwandan government has decided to implement a new system of state-organized popular courts called gacaca, although they have virtually nothing in common with the customary system of conflict resolution which bore this name. Arguing that conformity with tradition requires banning lawyers, they have made no provision for legal advice to either accused or victims. The system for choosing judges will be carried out, as were elections last year, by having people line up behind the persons of their choice. Those persons said to have """"divisive"""" ideas would not be permitted to serve, but there is no indication how or by whom this test would be applied. Some 220,000 judges are supposed to be trained in a few days time to interpret the genocide law as well as to implement Rwandan judicial procedure. In addition to paying for the training of judges and other personnel for the gacaca system, the E.U. should support the training of legal defenders to assist the accused and of independent monitors to follow the proceedings. Local human rights associations would be the most appropriate groups to organize this monitoring, perhaps through the use of small tape recorders to help record the proceedings. The Rwandan government continues to receive substantial support from the E.U. and its member states. During 1999, about 45 percent of its budget was paid for by foreign aid. The World Bank, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands continue to be major donors and Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Norway all indicated their intention to increase aid to Rwanda. In March 2000, the European Commission announced its new aid program, known as the national indicative program, to Rwanda, which signals a normalization of E.U. cooperation with Rwanda.  The E.U. and its member states should insist more vigorously that the Rwandan government investigate and bring to trial those soldiers, including senior officers, allegedly responsible for massacring civilians and for other serious human rights abuses. The E.U. and its member states should seek the expansion of the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda so it would be empowered, like the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, to prosecute crimes on an ongoing basis until the Security Council deems the conflict in the region no longer a threat to international peace. The E.U. and its member states should make assistance to gacaca conditional upon revision of the proposed system to provide the right of legal assistance to accused and victims and to eliminate existing measures for excluding persons who hold ideas unpopular with the government. The E.U. and its member states should not offer assistance to the villagization program as presently being implemented. Sierra Leone The international commitment to justice shown to Sierra Leone falls far short of that shown to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, especially Kosovo and East Timor, even though the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone match or surpass anything seen in these crises. Human Rights Watch is alarmed by the ongoing human rights abuses being committed by rebel groups in Sierra Leone since the signing of the Lomé peace accord, including extrajudicial killing, rape of girls and women, torture, abduction, ambushes, mutilation, attacks on aid workers and their beneficiaries, and looting of property. The attacks on villages have caused the displacement of thousands of civilians. Most of the victims were civilians in internally displaced persons camps, who were attacked when they ventured out to get food, wood and/or water. Several of the attacks occurred less than one kilometer from checkpoints manned by ECOMOG [the West African peacekeeping force], Sierra Leonean Army soldiers, and/or UNAMSIL peacekeepers.  Rebels forces have also refused to release all abducted civilians still being held by them despite having agreed to do so under the Lome Peace Accord. The rebels seem particularly reluctant to release girls and women who they continue to hold as sex slaves and 'rebel wives.' Abducted civilians who have recently escaped describe living under repressive conditions which include forced labor (particularly in the diamond mining areas), forced taxation and intimidation by rebel fighters. Residents of the capital Freetown report frequent incidents of extortion, theft and intimidation by rebel fighters who've settled in the capital. Governmental (police, loyal Sierra Leonean Army, ECOMOG) bodies responsible for the protection of the civilian population seem reluctant to establish the rule of law and intervene to stop these flagrant violations for fear of undermining the implementation of the peace accord. The management of the country's diamond resources will be critical for the success of the peace process. The Lomé agreement set up a Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development (CMRRD), which is headed by Foday Sankoh and which has yet to begin functioning. Given the well-known link between diamonds and arms purchases in Sierra Leone, effective and transparent control of the diamond resources is essential. In this regard, the E.U. and its member states should continue to notify neighboring governments, especially Liberia, that its assistance with the peace process, as well as with ending arms flows to Sierra Leone, will be a key to future E.U. assistance. Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. and its member states to use all possible means to pressure the rebels to cease their attacks on civilians, to release all abductees, and to allow for full access by humanitarian organizations. We call on the E.U. and its member states to support the operation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with a strong investigative component as required by the Lomé accord, and to support the rebuilding of the judicial system. In addition, we urge support for the work of Bethuel Abdu Kiplagat, appointed by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson to explore the possibilities for establishing an international commission of inquiry into human rights violations in Sierra Leone. The E.U. and its member states should also urge the human rights observers, deployed as part of the operation in Sierra Leone, to report promptly and publicly on current abuses affecting all civilians and call on the U.N. leadership to be responsive to the human rights observers reporting. Sudan The seventeen-year civil war continued in the south, in the Nuba Mountains, and in the east of Africa's largest country between the Islamist government and against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a coalition of armed opposition movements. Settlement proved elusive because of difficult issues of religion and the state, economic and political marginalization of minorities, and the diversity of Sudan's Arab and African, Muslim and non-Muslim population of thirty million.  The government persistently bombed civilian installations, including hospitals, and relief sites, killing and injuring civilians and destroying scarce infrastructure. Western Upper Nile has been the scene of many aerial bombardments at airstrips and in civilian areas as the government seeks to push the inhabitants who are southerners away from oil sites. On several occasions, the government military has made use of oil company equipment and a company airstrip in the south to conduct those bombing raids. Tens of thousands of people in Western Upper Nile have been forcibly displaced. The most serious abuse of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) is the armed ethnic conflict between its Bor Dinka soldiers and officers and the Didinga tribe which formerly supported the SPLA until its abuses—summary executions, torture, stealing food—led the Didinga to revolt. The SPLA planted antipersonnel land mines freely in the Didinga area. Despite many peace delegations, the SPLA has not implemented the recommendations to end this slaughter.  E.U. countries and others rushed to do business in Sudan, particularly in the petroleum sector, despite fears that oil development would only fund more weapons acquisition. The E.U. has decided to broaden its assistance from strictly emergency assistance to """"humanitarianism plus."""" In June 1999, the French government promised to side with Sudan within the E.U. The representative of the E.U. to Sudan noted in September that Sudan had taken practical steps that will lead to the full normalization of relations with the E.U., and cited the formation of a government fact-finding committee on slavery. The progress in human rights, however, has not gone nearly far enough. Although the Sudanese made a stab at dealing with the slavery problem, the continued refusal to recognize the problem for what it is -- slavery -- underlines the government's unwillingness to make any real reforms or to prosecute individuals for grave crimes committed against children and women. With minor exceptions, the ban on humanitarian operations in the rebel-held Nuba Mountains remains, and the continued arbitrary imposition of bans on humanitarian operations in southern Sudan kept the displaced and needy continually on the edge. There was no access for the U.N. or international NGOs to the rebel-held east. Human Rights Watch calls on the E.U. and its member states to support the establishment of a U.N. human rights monitoring office in both rebel and non-rebel areas of Sudan, an end to flight bans for humanitarian operations, and access to the whole country for humanitarian relief. The E.U. and its member states should urge the government to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention against Torture and its Additional Protocol, and cease all bombing in the south and Nuba Mountains until a system is in place to guarantee and verify that civilian objects and civilian populations are not targeted and are very rarely hit indiscriminately. The E.U. and its member states should do everything possible to support the peaceful settlement of the SPLA/Didinga conflict, and the People-to-People reconciliation process sponsored by the New Sudan Council of Churches. The E.U. and its member states should use all means of pressure with the Sudanese government to ensure the unconditional release of all children being held by the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) at their bases in Sudan.

Human Rights Watch today released fresh evidence of two additional cases of rape that it has documented through witness testimony. Human Rights Watch has previously documented rape in other Chechen towns and villages, including Shali and Alkhan-Yurt. (See, Rape Allegations Surface in Chechnya, HRW Release January 20, 2000.) The Geneva Conventions define rape as a war crime. """"It would certainly be a step in the right direction if the Russian government actually prosecuted a serviceman for rape,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But a single prosecution wouldn't begin to address the problem. There have been hundreds of war crimes, including summary executions and rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya."""" According to two eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Heda Kungayeva, 18, was raped and murdered by Russian forces sometime between midnight on March 26-27 and the evening of March 28, in the village of Tangi Chu south of Grozny.  According to """"A.B."""" (not the witness's real initials), Kungayeva was at home with her father and three siblings on the night of March 26. Her siblings told A.B.'s relatives that when soldiers came near their home, Kungayeva called out to her father, warning him of the arrival of the Russian forces and telling him to leave the house to avoid arbitrary detention. Her father departed, leaving Kungayeva in the house with her siblings.  A.B. reported that when her father returned, the other children informed him that the Russian soldiers had come to the house, looked at all the children, and said, """"We'd better take the pretty woman."""" The Russian soldiers then took Kungayeva away. """"B.D."""" (not the witness's true initials) told Human Rights Watch that on the night of March 26-27, B.D. heard screaming and shooting from the Kungayevs' house. B.D. ran to the Kungayevs' house just after midnight. Mr. Kungayev told B.D. that his 18-year-old daughter had just been taken away by Russian contract soldiers in an armored personnel carrier (APC). B.D. reported to Human Rights Watch that the sound of the APC pulling away from the village was still audible. Villagers followed the APC to the edge of Tangi Chu, and watched it return to the Russian military positions in the mountains surrounding the village. On March 27, a group of villagers obtained permission from local Russian forces to travel to Urus-Martan, seven kilometers from Tangi Chu, to search for Kungayeva. They believed that she might have been taken to one of two detention facilities run by Russian forces in that town.  A.B. and B.D. both reported to Human Rights Watch that on March 28, a Russian commander in Urus Martan told the group of villagers that Kungayeva was dead, and had been raped by drunken men. He promised to find and punish the perpetrators, and to return the corpse. The witnesses told Human Rights Watch that Kungayeva's body was returned on the evening of March 28. They said that her body was badly disfigured. Human Rights Watch has collected evidence of another rape, earlier this year, at the Kavkaz military checkpoint near the border with Ingushetia. Alisa (not her real name) reported to Human Rights Watch that in the last week of January, while traveling by bus with Maya (not her real name) from Chechnya to Ingushetia, the bus was stopped at the Kavkaz Russian military checkpoint, manned by Russian contract soldiers. Ostensibly because the photograph of Alisa in her passport no longer resembled her current appearance, the soldiers detained her, together with Maya. The bus driver pleaded with the soldiers not to detain the women, but the soldiers responded that the women would be sent back to their point of origin. The driver left. Alisa and Maya were taken to separate underground shelters near the checkpoint. In Alisa's shelter were four Russian soldiers who accused her of being a sniper. They gave her a gun and told her to dismantle it, put it back together, and then shoot. Alisa told Human Rights Watch that she had never held a gun and did not know how to handle one. One of the soldiers hit her with either his wrist or fist, and Alisa fell to the floor. Two other soldiers began kicking her. The soldiers told Alisa, """"You will never have children again."""" Then the soldiers raped her. Some time later, Maya was brought into the underground shelter where Alisa was being held. According to Alisa, Maya was covered in blood and her mouth was cut. Alisa told Human Rights Watch that Maya said she had also been raped. Alisa told Human Rights Watch that she believes Chechen fighters paid the Russian forces for their release. She spent three weeks in bed recovering from the abuse. Rape is considered a war crime under Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits it in its Article Four (Fundamental Guarantees), """"at any time, and in any place whatsoever…outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution, and any form of indecent assault.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Women's Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/29/china-increasing-harassment-bao-tong","China- Increasing Harassment of Bao Tong","China: Increasing Harassment of Bao Tong","Former Chinese Official Writes to Chinese Authorities","03/29/2000","(New York) -- Human Rights Watch today condemned the Chinese government's harassment of Bao Tong, a former Chinese Central Committee member imprisoned during the student protests in May 1989. In a letter to Chinese authorities made public today, Bao, who was released from prison in 1996, reports that security officials have stepped up their monitoring and harassment of him since the beginning of the year. (The text of the letter is below.) """"My personal freedom has been limited and violated. Day and night, whenever I step out of my home, there are always six people closely following me,"""" Bao writes in the letter. Bao opposed the Chinese government decision to send troops into Tiananmen Square in June 1989. In his letter, also sent to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, Bao Tong says that his treatment violates guarantees of free expression contained in the Chinese constitution and belies the """"great and glorious"""" picture of conditions in China described in a recent """"Human Rights White Paper"""" issued by Beijing. """"Bao Tong's arbitrary treatment shows just how little ‘rule of law' means in China,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"He's out of jail, but he's by no means free. He's threatened by officials each time he publicly questions Communist Party policy or complains about invasion of his personal freedom."""" Bao's letter was written on March 13, 2000, just prior to the opening of the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. He calls on the Commission to take note of """"what is unmentioned in the Chinese Human Rights White Paper,"""" and observes that, """"I am an old man, and I have neither fear nor illusions, but I feel obligated to confront such violations of a citizen's civil rights, even if that means my own imprisonment."""" A U.S.-sponsored resolution censuring China for its dismal human rights record is on the Commission's agenda. Almost a year ago, at the time of the 1999 Commission meeting, Bao Tong called for the reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 protests. Four Public Security Bureau officials warned him that he was """"endangering state security,"""" a notoriously vague charge that has been used repeatedly this past year to sentence critics of the government to lengthy prison terms. Bao Tong also complains that reporters interviewing him have been frequently warned they would be punished, and that his phone service has been cut at the time of important political anniversaries. Bao Tong was a senior aide to then Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang and author of many of China's economic reforms. Bao was detained on May 26, 1989, on his way to a Central Committee meeting. He was released in 1996 and kept under house arrest for one year. When his political rights were finally restored in May 1998, Bao Tong began speaking out against government and Party policies. The current curtailment of his civil rights, however, is the most egregious since his imprisonment. """"The Chinese government should immediately cease all harassment and threats against Bao Tong,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Bao Tong's letter: To: The Public Security Bureau of Beijing The State Security Ministry State Council of the Peoples Republic of China The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights  Date: March 13, 2000 To Whom It May Concern, It has come to my attention that our government has just published the Human Rights White Paper announcing that the people of China enjoy unprecedented democracy and freedom. I have also noticed that the U.N. Human Rights Commission is currently holding a meeting in Geneva. I am compelled to urge you to note that the Human Right White Paper published by our government only mentions one side, the great and glorious side; however it does not touch upon the other side, that is, the many outstanding problems that need to be addressed. My own situation is actually an example of victimization attributable to these remaining problems. First, my lawful right of freedom of expression has repeatedly been threatened. Ever since the government announced that my civil rights had been restored in May of 1998, I have spoken publicly, in accordance with Article 35 of the Constitution, about my opinions regarding China's political situation and its government's policy. However during these twenty-two months, I have been warned eight times by agents of the Public Security Bureau. They said that my actions constituted """"endangering state security."""" I was told that the reporters who interviewed me were """"punished"""" or were going to be """"punished."""" Whenever any important political anniversaries came along, my telephone line had technical difficulties such that I would have no phone service for days. Secondly, since the beginning of the year 2000, my personal freedom has been limited and violated. Day or night, whenever I step out of my home, there are always six people closely following me. They come with me when I accompany my granddaughter to school, and when I go to the hospital, bank or shops. They watch very closely to see who I talk to, what I do, and what I say. They even stopped me from getting into a taxi once, claiming that they were """"executing orders,"""" though they could never show me any legal justification to prove that they had the right to do so. In addition, it has long been a practice of the security agents to prevent guests from seeing me. The agents do not notify me of their actions. Perhaps their intention is to isolate me from the rest of society. This kind of violation of a citizen's individual freedom extends existing violations of citizens' political rights.  I believe that if such a thing can happen to me and it can not be resolved over a prolonged period of time, it can happen to other citizens as well. Therefore, given the publishing of the White Paper and the meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, I believe it is my obligation to report these problems, none of which are not mentioned in our government's Human Rights White Paper.  All of my interviews and articles are public and in accessible media (such as the AP, Reuter, etc.). The Chinese Constitution is also accessible. I welcome you to make your own determination according to the law as to whether my actions should be protected or punished, and whether article 35 and 37 of the Chinese Constitution uphold my right to freedom of speech. I also urge the court to make its judgment. By doing so, it would make clear to the world how China executes its own constitution and law; and how China is upholding its commitment to the U.N. Human Right covenants. I am an old man, and I have neither fear nor illusions, but I feel obligated to confront such violation of a citizen's civil rights, even if that means my own imprisonment. I have also directly reported my situation to the local Public Security Bureau. Even if they can not improve my situation, my only hope lies in their redirecting this letter to you. I also hope the Chinese government will not make the mistake of being so one-sided again when writing a Human Rights White Paper. I also urge the U.N. Commission to note what is unmentioned in the Chinese Human Rights White Paper. I thank you for you attention. Regards, Bao Tong Shi Jing Sha District, Beijing, PRC.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

The presidential People's Democratic Party (PDP) has thus far received thirty of the sixty-three seats in the lower chamber. Thirteen have gone to the Communist Party, two to the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP), and fifteen to independent candidates. The independent candidates, moreover, are almost without exception widely acknowledged to be solidly pro-government. A joint United Nations-Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observer mission statement noted that the February 27 elections failed to meet minimum democratic standards. But the government intensified its efforts to eliminate candidates in the March 12 run-offs who were perceived as not supportive of the president or as solid alternatives to the ruling party. Many of these candidates were either de-registered, threatened, or forced by authorities to withdraw their candidacy. """"The extensive and egregious violations committed during the campaign and on election day immediately called into question the integrity of the vote,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"But identical violations committed during the second round show that the Rakhmonov government has used every means possible to rig the vote and deliberately limit any real pluralism."""" In a letter to President Emomali Rakhmonov, Human Rights Watch documented obstruction of political parties; a wholly arbitrary candidate registration process and intimidation of independent candidates; numerous and grave irregularities in the voting procedure; state interference in the electoral process; and flagrantly biased coverage by the state media. """"We said the November 1999 presidential elections were a farce because they were a rubber stamp for just one candidate,"""" said Ms. Cartner. """"Sadly, many elements of this election are just as absurd. Despite its promises to the contrary, the government has once again demonstrated blatant bad faith in creating the conditions for a free and fair vote.""""  The ballot marked the last major step of the transitional period outlined in the June 1997 peace agreement that ended Tajikistan's five-year civil war. The government has made repeated promises to ensure free and fair conditions for the parliamentary ballot after the November 1999 presidential elections, which were criticized by the international community for severe restrictions on freedom of association and expression. In those elections, President Rakhmonov was reelected for a seven-year term.  Below is a copy of HRW's letter to President Rakhmonov. March 29, 2000 President Emomali Rakhmonov Dushanbe Republic of Tajikistan via facsimile: (73772)215110 Dear President Rakhmonov: We write to express our great disappointment at the conditions surrounding the parliamentary elections in Tajikistan, both in the February 27 vote and the March 12 run-off. Despite repeated promises by your government to ensure democratic conditions further to the deeply flawed November 1999 presidential elections, these elections once again resulted in an indisputable perversion of the democratic process. Authorities and the state media have in general presented the elections as a successful democratic exercise. However, a joint United Nations-Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observer mission, while commending the """"pluralistic"""" nature of the elections, noted that they failed to meet minimum international standards. The severity and extent of the violations documented by both the joint observer mission and Human Rights Watch show clearly that—as during the presidential campaign—the authorities made a concerted effort to manipulate the parliamentary ballot and limit true pluralism.  That your government once again demonstrated blatant bad faith in creating the conditions for a fair and open vote is of all the more concern to us given that the elections took place under the observance of the U.N. and the OSCE, two organizations mandated to play central roles in the implementation of the June 1997 peace accord. Further, despite a statement on violations provided by the joint observer mission that called into question the integrity of the vote, all of the violations noted by the observer mission on election day reoccurred and in many cases intensified during the March 12 run-off ballot. We are deeply alarmed by what appears to be your government's intention to flaunt criticism by the international community and openly shirk commitments under international law. We take this opportunity to point out some of the most flagrant violations that occurred. These include obstruction of the work of political parties, a wholly arbitrary candidate registration process and intimidation of independent candidates, numerous and grave irregularities in the voting procedure, state interference in the electoral process, and flagrantly biased coverage by the state media. Political Parties Six parties were permitted to participate in the elections: the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Communist Party (CP), the Socialist Party, the Democratic. Party (Almaty platform), the Adolatkhoh (Justice) Party and the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP). But numerous and grave violations, as described in this letter, obstructed the activities of other opposition parties and severely limited this ostensible pluralism. Of sixty-three seats in the lower chamber of parliament, the PDP gained thirty, the CP thirteen, and the IRP two. In addition, the majority of independent candidates are either PDP members or widely acknowledged to be solidly pro-government. Claiming vote-rigging, extremely high turnout figures and obstruction of party members' activities during the vote, as detailed further on in this letter, several parties have called for parts of the ballot to be invalidated. The IRP has called for the party list vote to be invalidated, the Communist Party has called for a vote recount in fifteen districts, and the Democratic Party, which did not attain the 5 percent threshold necessary to secure a seat, for repeat elections in seven districts. Further, those parties suspended, deregistered, or prevented from registering in the run-up to the November presidential elections, remained excluded from the parliamentary elections. These parties are among those that had formed the Consultative Council of Political Parties, and had criticized amendments to the constitution, through which the president's term was extended from five to seven years and which allows for 25 percent of the upper chamber of parliament to be directly appointed by the president and 75 percent by local parliaments, which are already led by presidential appointees.  To date, the Agrarian Party is still banned, the registration of the Party of Justice and Progress remains annulled, and the National Movement Party of Tajikistan continues to be denied registration. The Democratic Party (Teheran Platform) was suddenly suspended by the Supreme Court in early December 1999 on charges of illegal membership lists, despite the fact that its registration had previously been approved in March 1999 and that it had been allowed to participate in the presidential elections. Junbish, the newspaper that published the views of the opposition Consultative Council and other opposition parties, was closed down following threats and harassment from authorities just prior to the presidential elections; it has not reopened. Independent Candidates A wholly arbitrary application of registration rules, threats, and intimidation conducted mainly against those perceived to be unsupportive of the presidential party or considered weighty alternatives to pro-presidential candidates, also contrasts starkly against the supposedly pluralistic nature of the process. Moreover, despite the fact that the presidential party gained a clear majority during the first round of voting on February 27, efforts to eliminate all those perceived to be serious competitors intensified in the lead-up to and during the second round of voting on March 12. Violations and intimidation of opposition candidates were particularly conspicuous in districts where during the first round they had gained more votes than the pro-government candidate. According to the electoral law, independent candidates were to submit at least 500 signatures in support of their nomination; if 3 percent of the total number submitted was deemed invalid, registration was refused. Yet the law neglected to specify clearly whether the 3 percent applied to the minimum 500 signatures or to the entire signature list, which in many cases exceeded by two or three times the 500-signature minimum. Some candidates told Human Rights Watch that electoral commissions required them to submit only 500 signatures, while others related that they were allowed up to several thousand. Prior to election day on February 27, some fifty independent candidates were denied registration in what international electoral law experts termed a grossly selective registration process. The flaws in the registration process were particularly flagrant in Dushanbe, where two thirds of all independent candidates failed to gain registration. Several of these were leaders of political parties prevented from contesting the presidential elections, or who have links to these parties, while others were those perceived to be unsupportive of the presidential party or considered weighty alternatives to pro-presidential candidates. Rahmatullo Zoirov, chairman of the de-registered Party of Justice and Progress, was arbitrarily denied registration on the basis that 3 percent of the first 500 signatures on his 673-strong signature list were invalid. Despite his allegations that the district electoral commission had violated its own rules in dealing with his application, and despite an appeal to the Supreme Court, Zoirov was not registered. He told Human Rights Watch that on February 22 the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, stating """"we are turning down your application."""" When Zoirov requested a written reason, he was told that it would be delivered in three days, almost on the eve of the vote. According to Zoirov, """"I've fallen out of favor with the government. They know I'm a genuine alternative candidate—700 members of my party reside in my voting district—that's why they don't want me registered."""" Following his participation in the summer of 1999 in the Consultative Council of Political Parties, Zoirov told Human Rights Watch how he suffered professional harassment at the hands of university officials. In September 1999, the Supreme Court annulled the registration of his party, charging that it had technically violated membership rules. Zoirov's attempts to re-register the party prior to presidential elections were unsuccessful. Hikmatullo Nasriddinov, chairman of the banned Agrarian Party, told Human Rights Watch that he was refused permission by district and central electoral authorities to submit his registration documents, and that he had not received formal written notification of his registration denial from these authorities.  Both Sattor Asrorov and Saifiddin Turaev, representatives of the Justice Party (Turaev a former presidential candidate) were denied registration as single-mandate candidates; Asrorov told Human Rights Watch that he had not received formal written notification of his registration denial, as required by law. Although both candidates were allowed to run on the Justice Party ballot, the party failed to gain the required 5 percent threshold. Afzali Azam, chairman of the suspended Democratic Party (Teheran Platform), related that Rustam Faiziev, chairman of the Leninabad branch of the party, had been told by district electoral commission officials that he would not receive registration because he was a member of a party led by Azam. Human Rights Watch also received testimony regarding five independent women candidates in Dushanbe who were denied registration following alleged harassment and intimidation by electoral authorities.  In Faizobod, Asht and Vakhsh districts, PDP candidates won the run-off elections following intimidation and suspicious deregistration of opposition candidates. Muhiddin Kabirov, a member of the IRP running as an independent candidate in Faizobod, won more votes in the first round than Saidmurod Tagoev, the chairman of the Faizobod hukumat (local administration), but emerged as the loser during the run-off elections. He told Human Rights Watch that he had on at least two occasions received direct threats from a member of the presidential apparatus, who warned him """"not to play with fire"""" and threatened him to withdraw his candidacy, although """"if you win we'll just cancel the elections; nonetheless, we don't need to take that step because it's all been pre-determined."""" Kabirov also recounted how a member of the presidential apparatus had torn down his elections posters in Kofarnihon, where they were hanging alongside those of his opponent, and how he had been forced to move his campaign headquarters prior to the run-offs due to harassment from local authorities. In Asht, Communist Party candidate Nodir Solijonov was suddenly de-registered on March 7, on grounds that his supporters had conducted illegal campaigning on election day and that the Constitution had been violated through the promotion of communist ideology and communist values in his campaign. Communist Party officials told Human Rights Watch, however, that no complaints regarding illegal campaigning or constitutional violations had been made by electoral authorities on or prior to February 27. His deregistration left the PDP candidate Ibrogim Usmonov as the sole candidate on March 12. International observers also stated that the Communist Party candidate in Vakhsh, Sharif Gafurov, had undergone intense pressure from authorities to withdraw his candicacy before the March 12 run-off elections. Gafurov told Human Rights Watch on February 17, prior to the first round of voting, that policemen in Kurgan-Teppa had threatened drivers transporting Communist Party supporters to rallies and that he had been forced to relocate his campaign headquarters following threats from authorities. Gafurov lost to PDP member and chairman of the Vakhsh hukumat, Asomuddin Saidov.  In the districts of Mastcho, Yovon and Vose, the run-off race was limited to one candidate following the withdrawal of those reputedly not favored by the local administration. International observers stated that they had received information that in all three of these districts the candidates who withdrew had suffered harassment and intimidation from local authorities. Voting Procedure Serious irregularities in the voting procedure, including massive proxy voting, falsification of protocols, a heavy armed presence and intimidation by authorities, mathematical inconsistencies and errors in the tabulation of the vote, and overinflated voter turnout figures, call into serious question the legitimacy of the February 27 vote. Once again, all of these irregularities re-occurred and in some cases intensified during the March 12 run-off elections. The joint U.N.-OSCE observer mission noted that proxy voting was unacceptably high in close to 70 percent of the precincts observed on February 27. Human Rights Watch witnessed proxy voting in Kofarnihon and in several districts of Dushanbe on that day. In approximately half of the polling stations visited, polling station commission members sitting next to the ballot boxes asked each voter how many votes they were casting. International observers recounted that when they entered some polling stations, commission chairmen instantly warned commission members not to allow voters to employ proxy voting; the observers were later informed that this order was lifted after their departure from the polling station. International observers also noted that proxy voting during the second round was in some cases massive and that commission members were once again instructed not to allow proxy voting while international observers were present, but to resume following their departure. As the joint observer mission noted, a startingly high number of protocols were signed in pencil at the local polling station, but retranscribed in pen en route to the district or central electoral commissions. In Dushanbe alone, thirty-one out of thirty-two protocols observed were completed in pencil at the polling stations. International observers said that this pattern was repeated during the second round in at least the Leninskii and Vakhsh raions; in the latter, an observer claimed that the pencil-written results were entirely changed in their presence at the district electoral commission.  A heavy armed presence inside and close to polling stations in several districts contributed to an atmosphere of tension and intimidation. In Faizobod on March 12, Human Rights Watch witnessed a minimum of two to three armed policemen in uniform and civilian dress standing inside the entrance of each polling station, while others sat directly adjacent to the ballot box or stood outside the entrance to the polling station and further away in the street. Two Muhiddin Kabirov observers present in polling stations visited by a Human Rights Watch representative in Faizobod related that when the Human Rights Watch representative entered the polling station, the policemen left their posts beside the voting booths where they were """"counseling"""" voters, only to resume their positions once the representative left the polling station. International observers confirmed a similar armed presence in the districts of Vakhsh and Leninskii. Widespread and recurrent discrepancies, ranging from differences between the number of ballots issued and the number of persons who voted, to flagrant differences between protocols copied by international observers and final tabulation results, also cast serious doubt on the integrity of the results. Many international and political party observers recounted that during the count, for example, the IRP received a certain number of votes, but when the actual protocols were signed, they received far fewer votes than originally announced, or, in some cases, no votes at all. On numerous occasions, on both February 27 and March 12, political party or independent candidate observers were denied permission to observe the count, and in some cases they were excluded from polling stations altogether. The joint observation team noted that the disproportionately high voter turnout figure of 87 percent announced by the Central Electoral Commission two hours before the close of the polling stations on February 27 """"cast serious doubt over the integrity of the voting results""""; this figure, and the official final figure of 92 percent are at serious odds with the flow of voters observed by Human Rights Watch and international observers on election day, and with the high number of Tajik citizens registered on voters' lists but living outside the country. State Interference in the Election Process The electoral campaign and the February 27 vote pointed to an intrusive and manipulative role led by hukumat representatives. During run-off elections on March 12, international observers related that the presence of hukumat representatives and other unauthorized persons in polling stations exceeded even that observed on election day. In Faizobod on March 12, hukumat representatives were present in every single polling station visited by Human Rights Watch, many without appropriate accreditation. On at least one occasion hukumat representatives followed the Human Rights Watch representative between polling stations, and in other instances, the unauthorized hukumat representative refused to leave the representative's side while the representative conducted conversations with polling station commission chairmen or other commission members. The distinction between the role of the hukumat representatives and the polling station commission members was blurred to the extent that on several occasions the hukumat representatives responded to Human Rights Watch's requests for information and instructed commission members, for example, to avoid proxy voting or to tabulate the number of votes thus far gathered. One hukumat representative stated, """"I'm here to ensure that equal conditions are in place for both candidates."""" According to international observers and members of opposition political parties, in those polling stations where candidates not sympathetic to the government or presidential party gained more votes than the pro-government candidate on election day, polling station commission members were systematically replaced prior to the run-off elections. Opposition candidate Muhiddin Kabirov confirmed this trend in Faizobod, while other international observers related that they had gathered identical information in Vakhsh and Muminobod. Observers also recounted that in Isfara, the district electoral commission chairman was fired just before March 12, while local authorities were warned that they would be dismissed """"if the right candidate were not to win."""" A member of the Frunze district electoral commission of Dushanbe asserted that members of polling station commissions in the district had been instructed by highly-placed authorities to do away altogether with ballots cast in favor of the IRP. """"We were told to throw out IRP ballots during the count,"""" the commission member told Human Rights Watch. """"However, we were also told not to do it in front of the international observers, but rather to wait until they had gone, and throw them out then."""" The father of a member of a polling station commission in the Central District in Dushanbe related that his daughter, herself a polling station commission member, had told him that the commission members filled in unused ballots in favor of the PDP. Media Some access to state media was granted to political parties and independent candidates during the parliamentary electoral campaign, a small step forward for Tajikistan's all-controlling state media. Yet, despite provisions in the electoral law guaranteeing equal and ample coverage to all, state media, particularly state television, devoted an overwhelming portion of coverage to the presidential party and pro-presidential candidates. Research carried out by Human Rights Watch and an in-depth international study of coverage provided by Dushanbe-based government and private newspapers and the state television from the beginning of February until three to four days before the February 27 election shows that almost all of the newspapers accorded predominant coverage to the presidential party, the president himself, and current government figures and policy. In addition, according to the study, state television in its news and editorial coverage neglected to cover the campaign. Candidate debates that were to have been broadcast on state television did not occur. We respectfully call on the Tajik government to: as a matter of urgent priority, and taking into account recommendations provided by the joint U.N.-OSCE observer mission, ensure that repeat single-mandate constituency elections in Khojimaston, Kofarnihon and Khorog to be held on April 23 and afterward meet the standards for free and fair elections; as a matter of priority, make amendments to the electoral law as recommended by international organizations including the U.N., the OSCE and the International Foundation for Elections Systems (IFES), in the September 1999 Memorandum of Understanding signed by the government and the OSCE, and prior to the adoption of the law and during the course of the parliamentary ballot;  ensure that the review process of complaints submitted to electoral commissions and courts by political parties and independent candidates is swift and transparent, and conducted in accordance with the law; and, implement all recommendations contained in the final OSCE-Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) report to be issued within a month following the completion of the electoral process. Thank you for your attention to these concerns. We look forward to your reply.

As you know, a recent United Nations report named Burkina Faso in connection with violations of sanctions imposed on UNITA rebels in Angola who have been responsible for gross human rights abuses and systematic violations of international humanitarian law. The """"Report of the Panel of Experts on Violations of Security Council Sanctions Against UNITA,"""" released on March 15, concluded in part that """"it is highly likely that arms legally sold and transported to Burkina Faso have been diverted by Burkinabe authorities to UNITA in breach of Security Council sanctions.""""   In addition, independent Human Rights Watch investigations into weapons flows to abusive rebel forces in Sierra Leone and Angola have raised very serious questions about the witting or unwitting role of Burkina Faso as a country of transshipment for internationally proscribed weapons flows. The evidence suggests that large shipments of weapons Burkina Faso declared it was purchasing for its own use may in fact have been illegally diverted to other end-users, and that Burkinabe government resources, including the VIP wing of the Ougadougou airport and a government-registered plane, may have been used to facilitate such diversions. The reports to this effect are detailed below.   Reports of Illegal Arms Shipments via Burkina Faso   In April 1999 the commander of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, Maj.-Gen. Felix Mujakperuo, accused Burkina Faso of facilitating an illegal arms shipment to Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone in violation of a United Nations embargo. Speaking at a press conference in Freetown, he claimed that on March 14, 1999, a Ukrainian-registered cargo plane had delivered sixty-eight tons of weapons and ammunition to Ouagadougou. There, he alleged, the plane parked in the airport's VIP terminal and the weapons were transferred onto a plane destined for Liberia, which is also subject to a U.N. arms embargo, and then shipped onward to the RUF inside Sierra Leone. Mujakperou also reported the incident to the United Nations.   The Ukrainian government responded to these allegations in a June 1, 1999, letter to the U.N. committee responsible for monitoring the embargo on the RUF, to which it appended relevant documents. Ukraine maintained that it had sold the weapons to the government of Burkina Faso. The documents provided, of which Human Rights Watch has obtained copies, show that the government of Burkina Faso issued an end-user certificate to the Ukrainian state-owned company Ukrspetsexport for the purchase of weapons and ammunition in a deal arranged by the Gibraltar-based Chartered Engineering and Technical Company, Ltd. The end-user certificate explicitly states that the ministry of defense of Burkina Faso, """"the final consumer"""" of the goods listed, was committing itself to refrain from re-exporting the equipment without the agreement of the government of Ukraine. The Gibraltar-based company then contracted a trade agent of the Ukrainian air carrier Antonov Design Bureau, the British company Air Foyle, to fly the goods to Burkina Faso. According to the documents, flight ADB1737, an Antonov-124 (registration UR-82008), carried 67,564 kilograms of """"defense equipment and ammunition"""" from Kiev to Ouagadougou on March 13, 1999. The end-user certificate indicates that the deal involved 3,000 AKM (Kalashnikov) assault rifles, fifty machine guns, twenty-five rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs), five Strela-3 (also known as SA-7) missiles, and five Metis anti-tank guided missile systems, as well as ammunition for these weapons.   It is important to note that, according to an authoritative source on national arms inventories-Jane's Infantry Weapons-Burkina Faso has been using NATO-standard weaponry for its armed forces and has no known armaments deriving from the former Warsaw Pact. As a consequence, we believe it unlikely that Burkina Faso would have ordered and purchased for its own defense needs the quantities of weapons from the former Soviet Union provided in the shipment described.   In another case, Burkina Faso also was named as a transshipment country for weapons that were delivered to Sierra Leone. In an October 1999 article published in the Washington Post, author James Rupert reported that ECOMOG said five aircraft, including one whose registration matched that of a Boeing 727 owned by the Burkinabe government, had carried weapons to the RUF via Liberia. Quoting ECOMOG, Rupert told Human Rights Watch that the flights from Ouagadougou to Robertsfield International Airport in Liberia took place in February and September 1998, and that the Burkinabe Boeing 727-14, registration number XT-BBE, """"was seen offloading arms on 26 and 29 February 1998, each time after flying Rabat [Morocco]-Ouagadougou-Robertsfield.""""   Interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch in Burkina Faso in June 1998 further suggest that flights to parties under international embargo regularly transited through Ouagadougou airport. Pilots and staff indicated that flights carrying arms or fuel regularly arrived from central Africa to refuel in Ouagadougou on their way to other destinations. An official at the airport said, """"It can be one of any number of locations: Kinshasa, Brazzaville, UNITA. We don't ask questions.""""   In light of these serious allegations, we urge you to immediately appoint an independent commission to carry out a full inquiry. We further request that you make public the methodology of the inquiry and its findings at the earliest possible date.   We look forward to your response.   Sincerely,     Joost R.

Birdal's release from prison on health grounds in September 1999 was widely viewed as an attempt to avoid official embarrassment during the Istanbul OSCE Conference in November, and the European Union Helsinki Summit in December 1999. """"We are not only distressed that the Turkish government made this insincere gesture to international opinion, but that it is now compounding the farce but putting Birdal back in prison,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division. Birdal was imprisoned on June 3, 1999, for a speech he made three years earlier calling for """"peace and understanding."""" On March 28, 2000, he was deemed to be in sufficiently good health to resume prison life and was returned to Ankara Central Closed Prison to serve the remainder of his twelve-month sentence. He was convicted for """"inciting racial hatred"""" under article 312 of the Turkish Penal Code, which provides for sentences of up to three years for incitement to hatred on grounds of race or religion. In advance of the Helsinki Summit, the Turkish government repeatedly gave assurances that it was firmly established on the road to reform. In January, after Turkey's E.U. candidacy was approved, the State Minister Responsible for Human Rights Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik announced a list of """"short term aims"""" which included easing restrictions on free expression. Nothing, however, has been done. Akin Birdal, in undeniably fragile health after a near fatal shooting attack in 1998, is paying the price for the government's failure to keep its promises. Of the various articles of the Turkish Penal Code used to inhibit debate in Turkey, the most commonly used is article 312. Convictions under article 312 lead to bans on participation in politics or civil society. Because of the conviction under article 312, Akin Birdal, under article 4 of the Law on Associations, was forced to resign not only his leadership of the Turkish Human Rights Association but also his membership. Under article 81 of the Law on Political Parties he may not stand for any political office nor join any political party during his lifetime. .For politicians, a conviction under article 312 effectively means the end of public life and is therefore a powerful curb on ideas that are unwelcome to the state, such as the role in politics of ethnicity, religion or the military. Recep Tayyip Erdogan was stripped of his status as mayor of Istanbul for reading an inoffensive poem. Former education minister and leader of the Rebirth Party Hasan Celal Guzel, who was imprisoned under article 312 just five days after the E.U. summit, was also deprived of political rights for life and is being held at Ayas Closed Prison in Ankara. The former prime minister and leader of the Refah (Welfare) Party, Necmettin Erbakan, will be similarly excluded from politics if a sentence under article 312 is confirmed at appeal. He is already subject to a separate ban from politics as leader of a party closed down by the Constitutional Court.  Meanwhile, although a number of convictions under article 312 have already been found to contravene Article 10 of the European Convention in judgments against Turkey (including Ozturk v. Turkey 22479/93, 28/9/99; Ceylan v. Turkey 00023556/94, 8/07/1999; Incal v. Turkey 00022678/93, 9/6/98;), members of the Turkish judiciary and politicians still publicly voice their opposition to reform of the penal code. Yesterday, the chief prosecutor was reported as stating that article 312 should be retained unchanged as a bulwark against """"separatism and religious reactionism"""" (Radikal, March 28, 2000). It seems likely that the most immovable obstacle in the way of reforming article 312 is the army, the eminence gris of Turkish politics. In 1999 the chief of general staff warned that article 312 should not be amended.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

One of the victims featured in the report, Ismoil Adylov, has not been heard from since he disappeared in custody on February 22, 2000 Following a series of bombings in the country's capital, Tashkent, in February 1999, the Uzbek government launched a brutal and vigorous campaign against rights activists.

In a tactic unseen since the Stalin era, authorities forced several activists to attend public meetings in which speakers insulted them and accused them of """"anti-state activity."""" Law enforcement agencies have come down hardest on two unregistered human rights groups.

""""The space for free expression is in danger of disappearing entirely unless the government acts quickly."""" The appeals court upheld an earlier ruling that found prize-winning novelist and short story writer Laila al-`Othman's book, """"The Departure,"""" to be immoral but dropped the two month prison sentence against al-Othman and instead fined her, and her publisher Yahiya al-Rubay`an, 1000 KD (US$3260) each for immorality. The court also overturned the two month prison sentence against Kuwait University philosophy professor Dr. `Aliya Shu`ayb for defaming religion and instead fined Shu`ayb and al-Rubay`an 100 KD (US$326) each for publishing Shu`ayb's collection of Arabic poetry, """"Spiders Bemoan a Wound,"""" without a permit. Both books were also banned, although publication and distribution of """"The Departure"""" had been legal in Kuwait since 1984. The court's ruling is final.  The ruling is the most recent in a series of cases brought by Kuwaiti religious conservatives against journalists, writers, and academics. In October 1999 an appeal court upheld a one month prison sentence against the chair of the Kuwait University political science department, Dr. Ahmad al-Baghdadi. That court found that Dr. al-Baghdadi's comments in a student newspaper belittled religion by contending that the prophet Mohammad had failed to convert non-believers during his time in Mecca. Dr. al-Baghdadi was later pardoned after his health deteriorated in prison.  As in earlier cases, the court relied on the use of vaguely worded articles in Kuwait's Penal Code and Press Law that allow for sentences of up to three years in prison and a 3,000 KD fine (US$9,780) for inciting """"immoral acts"""" and up to one year in prison and a 1,000 KD fine (US$3,260) for disseminating """"opinions that include sarcasm, contempt, or belittling of a religion or a religious school of thought, whether by defamation of its belief system or its traditions or its rituals or its instructions.""""

On the day President Clinton arrives in Pakistan Dr. Farooq Sattar is set to face hearings for charges under the National Accountability Ordinance. The ordinance, adopted in November after the coup that brought General Pervez Musharraf to power, gives the National Accountability Bureau sweeping powers of arrest, investigation, and prosecution. Dr. Sattar has been in detention for four months and in solitary confinement for over ninety days. """"President Clinton cannot ignore this abusive law that is being used to bring Dr. Sattar to trial,"""" said Mike Jendrzejcyzk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The military government has used the National Accountability Ordinance to detain scores of political figures, who often have no idea of the charges being brought against them. President Clinton should strongly object to this.""""  The National Accountability Ordinance was ostensibly adopted to aid in the fight against corruption but Human Rights Watch noted that the broad terms of the law violate international standards and invite selective application against perceived political enemies. Detainees need not be produced in court within 24 hours, as otherwise required by Pakistan's Criminal Procedure Code, and bail is prohibited. The ordinance also allows for expedited trials to be conducted within thirty days. Convicted persons are automatically barred from holding political office for twenty-one years.  Dr. Farooq Sattar is a former parliamentary leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in the suspended assembly of Sindh province. The MQM represents mohajirs, Muslims who migrated to Pakistan after the partition from India in 1947.  On November 17, 1999, paramilitary forces and members of the police raided and ransacked Dr. Sattar's home in Karachi. On November 26, after addressing a news conference at the Karachi Press Club, Dr. Sattar surrendered to the authorities and was taken to a military base in Karachi. On February 7 he was produced before the National Accountability Court in Karachi but was not informed of the charges against him. The court remanded him to detention for another fourteen days. On February 23 Dr. Sattar was flown to Islamabad and taken to Attock Fort, ninety-five kilometers away and notorious as a site for the illegal detention of political opponents over the course of successive governments.  The following day, Dr. Sattar was formally charged with corruption-related offenses before the National Accountability Court in Attock Fort. Dr. Sattar's father, who visited his son for an hour that day, told Human Rights Watch, """"They have kept [Sattar] in solitary confinement for months. Though they do not torture him physically, they are trying to do everything to psychologically and morally break him."""" Dr. Sattar is a heart patient with ulcer problems.  Human Rights Watch has called for the amendment of the National Accountability Ordinance so as to vest the powers of arrest and investigation, and of prosecution, in separate bodies. Detainees should be produced in court within twenty-four hours, and once charged, should have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defense. The automatic prohibition on holding elected office for twenty-one years upon conviction should be repealed since it violates the political rights of those concerned.  In the absence of such amendments Dr. Sattar and others detained under the ordinance should be tried under Pakistan's existing penal laws and in accordance with the Pakistan Code of Criminal Procedure. Dr. Sattar should also be entitled to a civilian medical examination.  Several prominent office holders in the Sharif administration also continue to be illegally detained by the military government. Human Rights Watch urged that the legal status of these officials be clarified without delay.

The report offers the first detailed evidence of Rwandan Hutu participating in the insurgency in Burundi, and suggests that they represent almost half the combatants in some rebel units operating around Bujumbura. Many of them are soldiers of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 genocide of Tutsi in Rwanda. The previously close collaboration recently fell apart in some units, however: the report describes how one hundred Rwandans were slaughtered by their comrades in the FNL (Forces Nationales de Libération).     The report also describes the slaughter of more than two hundred civilians by the Burundian armed forces, the FNL, and the CNDD-FDD (Conseil National pour la Défense de la Démocratie-Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie; now more commonly called the FDD). The report gives evidence of two recent insurgent attacks on humanitarian agencies.     In the most recent round of negotiations to end the Burundian war, negotiators and foreign observers for the first time talked openly of an amnesty for such crimes and for other killings of tens of thousands of civilians during the six-year old war.     """"An amnesty in Burundi is exactly the wrong direction to take,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Many of the killings in Burundi, whether perpetrated by Tutsi or by Hutu, were crimes against humanity. A U.N. Commission has described some of them as genocide. How can there be any hope of justice and order in Burundi if crimes of this magnitude are left unpunished?""""     Human Rights Watch urged the creation of a new division of the existing International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to prosecute crimes committed in Burundi. It also recommended using foreign jurists within Burundian courts to speed judging the thousands of persons accused of ethnic killings and other attacks since 1993.     """"If a peace is cobbled together without justice for Burundi, this will be felt throughout the region,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Given the bitterness of ethnic tensions in Central Africa, the failure to insist on accountability for crimes in Burundi will encourage ruthless leaders to choose ethnic slaughter as a way to defeat their enemies.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/23/china-talks-sweet-human-rights","China Talks Sweet on Human Rights","China Talks Sweet on Human Rights","","03/23/2000","China has unveiled a new """"kinder and gentler"""" strategy for dealing with accusations of human-rights violations. Not surprisingly, the softer approach coincides with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which opened in Geneva this week. The United States has agreed to sponsor a resolution censuring China, and Beijing wants to make sure it never comes up for a vote, or if it does, that it's defeated. Only once, in 1995, did the U.N. Human Rights Commission come close to censuring China. But Beijing cares deeply about the loss of face it would suffer should a critical resolution actually be adopted. In order to keep such measures off the agenda, it has gone to extraordinary lengths to lobby governments world-wide. These efforts, however, should not be mistaken for real progress. Indeed, while Beijing plays the PR game abroad, it is escalating its clampdown on its own citizens. I first noticed Beijing's change in tack earlier this month while listening to Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen describe his country's human rights policy at a U.N. workshop on human rights in the Asia-Pacific region. As the Washington director of Human Rights Watch 's Asia Division I was surprised to be invited to Beijing for the workshop. In fact, given the role of my organization as a critic of the government's abuses, I never expected to be in China at all. Nonetheless, I was immediately struck by Beijing's new softer line on human rights. Gone at least for the moment was the harsh rhetoric about """"noninterference in the internal affairs"""" of China. Instead, in an opening message read to the delegates, President Jiang Zemin stressed that in the 21st century, China's leaders must """"run the country according to law {and} ensure our people more extensive rights and freedoms,"""" while also touting the """"spectacular results"""" on human rights already achieved by China. Top Chinese officials have become cheerleaders for """"the rule of law,"""" both to counter complaints domestically about corruption as well as to rebut criticism from abroad. Qian Qichen lectured us on the benefits of the rule of law, but reminded his largely Asian audience of recent colonial history in the region, and added a warning that """"democracy and the rule of law are no country's monopoly and don't come under a unified model."""" Along with other Chinese officials, Mr. Qian declared that deciding how international human rights standards are applied is up to each government depending on """"national conditions."""" And the way to deal with differences is through """"dialogue and exchanges on the basis of equality."""" Beijing's softer rhetoric will be useful for attracting U.N. Commission votes from other developing countries, and it will also help to get China's major trading partners off the hook. Many of them would prefer to limit discussion of human rights to rather sterile """"dialogues,"""" underway between China and the European Union, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Australia and others. Yet even while the U.N. workshop was underway in Beijing, dissidents were being detained, the wife of imprisoned pro-democracy activist Xu Wenli went on a hunger strike, and security was stepped up to prevent Falun Gong members from demonstrating outside the hotel where the U.N. was meeting. The legal reforms that China has adopted in recent years, such as amendments providing greater safeguards for detainees, have not deterred Beijing's intensified crackdown. Enforcement remains inadequate, and the legal changes thus far in no way address the need for more fundamental political reform. This put Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, in an awkward position. Her office organized the conference, and she had hoped to finalize an agreement with China on legal and technical exchanges -- a useful long-term initiative. But she could hardly turn a blind eye to the abuses taking place right under her nose. What Mrs. Robinson did was principled and tactically wise. At a packed press conference, she condemned the recent crackdown on free expression, freedom of religion and association. While hoping to continue her talks with China's leaders, she clearly recognized that it is in their interest to cooperate with the U.N., and Beijing cannot afford to cut off talks. Governments should follow Mrs. Robinson's example and refuse to be silenced. Other countries should be lining up to co-sponsor the resolution to censure China, and to oppose any attempts by China to keep it off the Commission's agenda. This will help strengthen the U.N.'s hand in dealing with Beijing, while also providing urgently needed moral support to those trying to change China from within. When faced with a credible campaign in Geneva in the past, China has taken some limited but positive steps forward -- such as signing U.N. human rights treaties or releasing high-profile political prisoners. After many years of stonewalling, Beijing is starting to use some high-flown language on human rights and the rule of law. But the international community has to make sure those words actually mean something.

The civilians were detained for four days in the besieged village of Komsomolskoye, some thirty kilometers south of Grozny.  Russian forces began to shell Komsomolskoye on March 4 to dislodge Chechen fighters who were trying to break through to the Chechen lowlands. On March 5, without warning, Russian warplanes, helicopters, tanks, artillery and mortar units unleashed a ferocious assault on Komsomolskoye, aimed at fighters present in the village. More than 2,000 civilians fled as far as a Russian checkpoint about 500 meters from the village, along the main exit route, where they were trapped en masse in the open air. Russian forces did not permit males between the ages of ten and sixty to pass the checkpoint. The vast majority of female civilians also did not leave, fearing their absence would invite the beating and/or detention of their male relatives. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch researchers that several civilians were wounded by gunfire and shrapnel while they were trapped in the field. On March 7, Liuba Ozdomirova (about sixty), Tamara Ilyasova (seventy) and her son Khassan (thirty-six) were injured by shrapnel, and on March 8, Aindi Bataev (forty-one), received a bullet wound to the stomach.

Two women gave birth while trapped in the field; the baby of one of these women, Zura Shaipova (about thirty-two), born on March 8, died that day from exposure, according to one witness. Twenty-one-year-old Luisa Ismailova, who left the field on March 8, told Human Rights Watch how her three-month-old baby daughter, Markha, currently in intensive care in Nazran, contracted double-pneumonia due to exposure while trapped outside Komsomolskoye. """"Russian authorities claim their forces are protecting civilians and restoring their rights,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But Russian forces certainly didn't protect the people of Komsomolskoye -- they exposed them to greater danger. This is unacceptable in wartime.""""  Russian forces did not provide any food or water for the trapped civilians. Some women in the group who managed to reach the town of Urus-Martan-some twelve kilometers away- brought back small supplies of food and water. On the morning of March 9, the fifth day of the assault on the village, Russian soldiers separated the men and women trapped in the field and began to check their documents. Eyewitnesses described to Human Rights Watch how soldiers detained as many as eight men, and kicked and beat them with rifle butts. The detainees included Said Visaev (seventeen), a refugee from Grozny; Beslan Umarov (twenty-two) from Astrakhan; Arbi Moloyev (about thirty-two) from Komsomolskoye; and two Chinese citizens, Hassan Saidi (thirty-six) and Amirzhan Amuti (thirty), who ran a cafe in Grozny. The detained men were taken away by Russian forces. On March 10, Said Visaev's mother and two aunts traveled to Urus-Martan to ascertain whether he was being held in a detention facility in an abandoned orphanage. Visaev's aunt Fatima described to Human Rights Watch how they found Visaev's corpse in a hospital building in Urus Martan, beaten almost beyond recognition. She said his left eye was missing, his face swollen and a large hole had been smashed in the back of his head. On March 17, Saidi's and Amuti's business partner, Lema (forty-three), told Human Rights Watch that he has since been unable to determine his partners' whereabouts. Human Rights Watch is concerned for the welfare of these and other detainees, last seen alive in Russian military custody. Up to one hundred civilians, mainly elderly, disabled, or wounded persons, were left trapped in Komsomolskoye itself throughout the bombardment. These civilians may well have been killed in the ferocious fighting that ensued. Initial reports suggest that large numbers of Chechen fighters under the command of Ruslan Gilaev arrived in Komsomolskoye in early March. The presence of many armed fighters in a densely populated village greatly endangered the lives of the civilian population. Human Rights Watch also condemned this serious violation of international humanitarian law.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Security Council Must Ease Iraq Crisis","Humanitarian Emergency Should be Focus of Friday Debate","03/22/2000","In a letter sent yesterday, Human Rights Watch and five other organizations asked the United Nations Security Council to take decisive steps to address the humanitarian emergency in Iraq.  """"The Council should make Friday's meeting open and public,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, """"and the U.S. should stop pretending that the sanctions have nothing to do with the dire public health crisis confronting millions of Iraqis."""" Megally also criticized the many """"holds,"""" which stop contracts without rejecting them, that the United States and the United Kingdom have placed on key Iraqi imports.  The signatories of today's letter include Save the Children/UK and the Mennonite Central Committee, which have ongoing humanitarian aid programs in Iraq. In early January, Human Rights Watch asked the Security Council to lift most restrictions on Iraq's non-military trade and investment while tightening controls on the country's ability to import weapons-related goods. The organization, citing its own extensive documentation of government responsibility for genocide and crimes against humanity, also called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to try top Iraqi leaders.  The Security Council scheduled this Friday's meeting to discuss the Secretary-General's March 10 report on the oil-for-food program (S/2000/208). In that report the Secretary-General noted that an """"excessive number of holds"""" continued to impede the relief program and regretted that the sanctions committee, made up of the Security Council member states, had not responded to his earlier request that it provide """"written and explicit explanations"""" regarding holds within twenty-four hours (paragraphs 84 and 87).  The Secretary-General's report cited as an example the hold on a harbor dredger for the port of Umm Qasr, Iraq's major port of entry, an item whose absence makes the offloading of vital food and spare parts slow and inefficient (paragraph 72). """"This appears to be an instance where concern for potential dual use lacks balance and a sense of proportion,"""" said Megally, """"It makes a mockery of the Council's stated concern for the well-being of ordinary people.""""  Holds on contracts in the water and sanitation and electric power sectors, the report said, have been a major factor impeding progress in the area of public health, where emergency conditions persist. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in a December 1999 report, said that the oil-for-food program """"has not halted the collapse of the health system and the deterioration of water supplies, which together pose one of the gravest threats to the health and well being of the civilian population.""""  A copy of the joint letter is attached.  ****  Open Letter to the Security Council Concerning the Humanitarian Situation in Iraq  Global Policy Forum Human Rights Watch Mennonite Central Committee Peace Action Education Fund Quaker United Nations Office Save the Children (UK)  To: His Excellency Anwarul Karim Chowdhury President of the United Nations Security Council cc. Security Council Member State Delegations  March 22, 2000  Dear Mr President and other Member State representatives:  We are writing to you to express our deep concern about the commitment in the Security Council to improving the humanitarian crisis in Iraq. We urge the Council, in its March 24 debate on the most recent report of the Secretary-General on Iraq (S/2000/208), to address this emergency in a thorough and transparent manner, to show determination to implement the humanitarian provisions of UNSCR 986, 1153 and 1284 (1999), and to accord the necessary priority to fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles in the design and operation of the Iraq sanctions regime.  Our views are based on our long experience with Iraq issues, and months of dialogue with UN agencies, diplomatic missions and other non-governmental organisations. We believe strongly that humanitarian and human rights principles have been consistently subordinated to political considerations in the Council's approach to Iraq. We fully acknowledge that the Government of Iraq shares much responsibility for the current situation, and continues to pose security concerns. We are convinced, however, that the Security Council, with the support of the Secretariat, must take swift and decisive action to halt and reverse the longstanding humanitarian emergency in Iraq.  Firstly, the Security Council, should mandate the Secretariat to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the humanitarian situation in Iraq, and should facilitate the greater availability of existing information about the impact of the Oil for Food Programme and the comprehensive sanctions. Towards this end, the Council should authorise a greater degree of transparency and accountability with regard to the decisions and procedures of the 661 Sanctions Committee on Iraq and the Security Council itself.  Secondly, the Council and the Sanctions Committee should encourage and facilitate input and analysis from independent, technical experts from UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on practical ways of improving the humanitarian situation. To facilitate this, information concerning the humanitarian situation should be disseminated more widely.  Thirdly, the Security Council should hold an open and informed debate, beginning with the March 24 meeting, that acknowledges the link between the sanctions design and the humanitarian emergency. The ICRC has stressed repeatedly that the increase in disease epidemics and the deteriorating health situation in Iraq, is related directly to the disrepair of public services such as water, sanitation and electricity, a situation that is sustained by inadequate finances and the large number of items placed on hold.  Fourthly, the Security Council must recognise that short-term emergency assistance is no longer adequate or appropriate in Iraq, and longer term infrastructure needs and investment must be addressed. The determinants of the public health emergency have changed during the years under sanctions but this has not been adequately reflected in a change in the design and implementation of the humanitarian programme. The Oil for Food Programme has at best halted further deterioration in basic nutritional and health indicators in the Iraqi population, primarily through the delivery of food and medicines. UNICEF has documented that the programme has failed to reverse that deterioration in the Centre/South of Iraq, and that unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates persist. The health status of the population is contingent upon public services that have now deteriorated to such an extent that they undermine other health interventions. The present humanitarian programme remains a temporary, emergency, relief-driven operation that only partially meets vital needs. It has fostered a culture of dependency and helplessness and isolated a whole generation from the outside world. Inadequate both in terms of financing and in design, it cannot address the current humanitarian needs and priorities of the Iraqi population. If the Security Council continues to insist that the Oil for Food programme remain a short term programme, based on relief supplies, despite evidence of the long term impact of sanctions of Iraq's war-damaged society, the Security Council will not be meeting its human rights and humanitarian responsibilities.  Fifthly, all the humanitarian provisions of existing Council resolutions must be speedily and fully implemented if the Council's stated humanitarian commitment is to retain any credibility. UNSCR 986, 1153 and 1284 have all mandated improvements which have yet to be fully implemented. In part this is because of the Government of Iraq's lack of co-operation, but also because of a lack of consensus within the Security Council. The Council, in UNSCR 1153, recognised that infrastructure repair and a project-based approach was just as critical as the delivery of food commodities to address the unacceptable declines in health and nutritional status. The high number of holds on individual contracts in the electricity, water and sanitation sectors, which often have a wider impact on whole programmes, have clearly undermined the impact of Resolution 1153. Unless pragmatic attempts are made also to implement a cash component in the Centre in order to meet recurrent costs, there will continue to be inadequate training, transportation and service delivery.  Finally, even if all the already mandated changes were implemented, it is doubtful that all the needed improvements could be secured under the current structure of the Iraq sanctions regime. The deterioration in the country's civilian infrastructure is so extensive that it can only be reversed with much needed cash and investment in general infrastructure, and the oil sector in particular. The present arrangement, moreover, unreasonably traps U.N. humanitarian agencies between the demands of the Security Council and the Government of Iraq. A shift to longer term development planning is now vital. This should be combined with discussions of development plans relating to the post-sanctions scenario, particularly with reference to Northern Iraq.  Whilst not ignoring the ongoing security concerns posed by Iraq, the Security Council must do all in its power to protect the fundamental rights of the civilian population. We are therefore compelled to call for a radical redesign of the sanctions regime to make the sanctions more targeted, effective and credible. The current sanctions regime hurts the most vulnerable and fails to touch Iraq's political leaders.  Yours sincerely,  James A.

Federation. In light of compelling evidence of serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by the Russian armed forces in Chechnya, we believe that the Bank should delay any such payments for general budgetary spending until such time that the Russian government evidences a clear commitment to abide by international law in Chechnya, including by the acceptance of an international monitoring presence in the region and the initiation of a serious, transparent investigation of alleged abuses. We recognize that the decision to disburse the funds rests with the Bank's management and have today written the attached letter to Mr. Wolfensohn, outlining our view that the pending payment to the Russian Federation would be contrary to the Bank's policy and mandate. At the same time, we are also looking to the Bank's shareholders to express their serious reservations about this payment. Through more than five hundred exhaustive interviews with victims, witnesses, and family-members, we have documented serious violations of international humanitarian law in Chechnya, including indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing, widespread looting, arbitrary detention, torture, and the summary executions of more than120 civilians by Russian troops. After recent meetings in Moscow with Russian military officials, the military procurator, and the Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, moreover, we are forced to conclude that the Russian government has not undertaken a serious process of accountability for these abuses. As is elaborated in the attached letter to Mr. Wolfensohn, we strongly believe that any payment to the Russian government for unfettered general budgetary spending at a time when its military is so flagrantly violating international law would be contrary to Bank policy. Moreover, it would send the wrong signal to both the Russian government and the residents of Chechnya. At a time when the international community is seeking to influence the agenda of a new Russian government, it would indicate a subordination of good governance, rule of law, and human rights to other items on the agenda. In addition, it would exacerbate the feeling of abandonment that we have seen growing among the people of Chechnya. Throughout the past five months, our staff based in Ingushetia have witnessed a radicalization of the civilian population that is tinged with animosity toward not only the Russian Federation, but also the """"West,"""" which many see as ignoring their plight and even financing Russia's military operation. These are worrisome factors that should reinforce your opposition to the Bank's pending payment.  We hope that you will voice strong reservations about the Bank's payment.

You will recall that we wrote to you in December at the time of the last structural adjustment loan payment. We expressed our concern that such payments--for unfettered general budgetary spending by a government waging a war characterized by serious violations of international humanitarian law--were contrary to the Bank's development mission. In response, you acknowledged that """"development of basic human rights in the social and economic spheres is an integral part of our mission,"""" and further stated, """"We share the concerns expressed by Human Rights Watch, the OSCE and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that human rights and humanitarian law be respected by all in Chechnya.""""  Notwithstanding your concerns regarding developments in Chechnya, the $100 million payment was made in late December, but Bank management stated at the time that it would consider the impact of the war in Chechnya in connection with future disbursements. Accordingly, we would like to update you on developments in Chechnya since the last payment, based on over five hundred interviews with the displaced, carried out by our permanent research staff in Ingushetia.  Throughout January and February, Russian forces continued their indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing and shelling of civilian objects, causing heavy civilian casualties and violating their Geneva convention obligations to focus their attacks on combatants. Russian forces have often refused to create safe corridors to allow civilians to leave areas of active fighting, trapping civilians behind front lines for months. While the Russian forces' indiscriminate bombing campaign has claimed the vast majority of civilian casualties in Chechnya, the worst atrocities have occurred once the bombing stops and Russian troops take control. We have documented at least fifty murders, mostly of older men and women, by Russian soldiers in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny after Russian forces took control of that district, beginning in late December. The victims were innocent civilians shot to death in their homes and their yards. On February 5, a few days after you met with Acting President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russian forces went on a killing spree in the Aldi district of Grozny, shooting at least sixty-two and possibly many more civilians who were waiting in the street and their yards for soldiers to check their documents.  Unfortunately, we have seen no indication that the Russian authorities are prepared to undertake the kind of serious investigation and process of accountability that you know from experience is essential to reconciliation and eventual peace building and reconstruction. We recently traveled to Moscow for high-level meetings with the Russian military, the military procuracy, and the Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, in order to convey our findings and offer our cooperation with their investigations. We were disappointed that none of our interlocutors seemed to have taken significant steps toward a full investigation. Yuri Dyomin, the military procurator of the Russian Federation, told us on March 10 that he had """"never heard of"""" the massacres in the Staropromyslovski and Aldi districts of Grozny. His office announced this week that its investigation has now concluded that Russian soldiers were not involved in the Aldi massacre. The failure to rein in abusive Russian troops and undertake a serious, transparent process of accountability runs up the chain of command to acting President Putin, an ominous sign not only for developments in Chechnya, but also for the future of good governance and rule of law in Russia.  The Bank cannot ignore these developments in taking its decision regarding payments to the Russian Federation. You have been at the forefront of a comprehensive approach to development that recognizes the connection between poverty and insecurity. Just last week, in releasing your commendable """"Voices of the Poor"""" study, you highlighted the plight of those who """"do not know who to trust, the police or the criminals."""" The Bank cannot undertake a comprehensive approach that encompasses such concerns, and at the same time consider serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by a government's armed forces irrelevant to the decision to finance that government. Consideration of such violations should not fall within the category of """"political considerations"""" prohibited under the Bank's Articles of Agreement. This is not a political matter, but rather a legal one, that can be addressed in a manner that is fully consistent with and supportive of the Bank's mandate. Were the Bank to undertake such an analysis with respect to the Russian government's conduct in Chechnya, we believe that it would necessarily reach the conclusion that pending payments for general budgetary spending must be delayed until the government evidences a clear commitment to abide by international law in Chechnya, including through the acceptance of an international monitoring presence and the initiation of a serious, transparent investigation of alleged abuses.  We would welcome an opportunity to meet with you to discuss our findings in the north Caucasus further, and also to explore the broader lessons that might be drawn from that situation for your efforts to develop Bank policy., particularly in the context of discussions that we understand are underway regarding the Bank's policy on conflict and development. A member of our staff will contact your office in the coming days to identify a mutually convenient time for such a discussion.

Action on Chechnya Urged","Russian Investigations Not Serious, Says Rights Group","03/21/2000","Russian government investigations into atrocities committed in Chechnya have shown that they are unlikely to produce any serious result, Human Rights Watch said in letters sent to several European and U.S. foreign ministers today.  Yesterday, the Russian military prosecutor's office said that its investigation had concluded Russian soldiers were not involved in the massacre of more than 60 civilians in the Grozny suburb of Aldi in early February. (See, """"More than Sixty Civilians Murdered in Chechen Capital,"""" HRW Release 2/23/00) The massacre was first reported by Human Rights Watch, based on extensive and closely-corroborated testimony from witnesses and survivors of the massacre. In December, the military prosecutor also concluded that """"no crime"""" had taken place in Alkhan-Yurt, where Human Rights Watch had found that at least fourteen civilians were summarily executed. """"The Russians have shown that there's no longer any point in waiting for their investigations,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The only alternative now is a sustained and thorough investigation by the U.N. Member states should do everything possible to make that investigation happen."""" The letter was sent to the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States, urging them to initiate a resolution in Geneva. In recent high-level meetings with the Russian military, the military procuracy, and the Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, Human Rights Watch officials were disappointed that none of them seemed to have taken significant steps toward a full investigation. Yuri Dyomin, the military procurator of the Russian Federation, told Mr. Roth on March 10 that he had """"never heard of"""" the massacres in the Staropromyslovskii and Aldi districts of Grozny, where Human Rights Watch found that at least 110 civilians were summarily executed. Human Rights Watch said it welcomed the appointment of Vladimir Kalamanov as Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, but regretted that his mandate is primarily to forward cases to a military procuracy that has shown itself to be so cynically disposed to allegations of abuse. The letter urged that the appointment of Mr. Kalamanov, even with two proposed international experts from the Council of Europe on his staff, should not be viewed as a substitute for measures that the U.N. Commission could take to hold Russia accountable for the worst abuses perpetrated in Chechnya. """"The United States and the European Union have repeatedly condemned the abuses in Chechnya,"""" said Roth. """"But no forum is more appropriate for frank talk and tough action than the U.N. Commission in Geneva. This opportunity must not be missed.""""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/21/open-letter","Open Letter","Open Letter","","03/21/2000","Dear Minister:  Now that the Fifty-Sixth U.N. Commission on Human Rights has opened we would like to relay to  you some urgent concerns about the process of accountability for abuse by Russian forces in the  context of the Chechnya conflict, and the challenge this Commission faces in pursuing this goal. Ten  days ago, Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, had the opportunity to present  our concerns to Russian officials in a series of high-level meetings in Moscow with the Russian  military, the military procuracy, and the Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya.  These meetings raised serious concerns relevant to this Commission's work.  Our discussions in Moscow revealed that Russian prosecutorial agencies have taken no significant steps to investigate the war crimes--the summary executions in Alkhan-Yurt and in the Staropromyslovskii and Aldi districts of Grozny--that our organization and others have documented. Just today, we have learned, the military procurator closed its inquiry into the more than sixty summary executions at Aldi, concluding that Russian soldiers were not involved. It is unlikely that, short of intense political pressure, any serious investigation will be undertaken at all.  A rigorous investigation would require, at minimum, a commitment to get to the bottom of compelling allegations. Yet, by his own account, Russia's top military procurator Yuri Dyomin, treated the investigation into the summary executions at Alkhan-Yurt in a way that suggests nothing short of bad faith: the inquiry focused on events leading up to and including the seizure of the village, whereas the seventeen summary executions we documented took place after Russian forces had taken control of the village. The inquiry, not surprisingly, was closed. In our meeting with him on 10 March, Mr. Dyomin claimed he had """"never heard of"""" the 110 summary executions in the Staropromyslovskii and Aldi districts of Grozny, although, upon hearing the details of our investigation, agreed to receive our materials. In response to our allegations of summary executions, rapes, widespread looting, and the like, he maintained that criminality among Russian forces serving in Chechnya was among the lowest in the country because soldiers are """"too busy fighting the war."""" His office had prosecuted just seven soldiers for crimes perpetrated against civilians: two in relation to one murder (he declined to provide any further information); two for """"hooliganism,"""" two for theft, and one for improper handling of a weapon. Mr. Dyomin dismissed our allegations (which are based on independent, exhaustive interviews with hundreds of witnesses) and those of other human rights organizations. He displayed deep mistrust and scorn for accounts provided by refugees, who in fact are often an excellent source of information. Noting that the procuracy was obliged to perform an inquiry on information from all sources, including the media and NGOs, he said that he """"regretted the time he wasted"""" running inquiries """"based on disinformation."""" While in principle we welcome the appointment of Vladimir Kalamanov as Presidential Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, it is distressing that his mandate is primarily to forward cases to a military procuracy that is so cynically disposed to allegations of abuse. He can also turn directly to the president, but since Acting President Vladimir Putin has so far chosen not to exert political pressure to ensure accountability, we are not hopeful that he will do so in the future. We have other reservations about Mr. Kalamanov's efforts. To his credit, he clearly seeks to cooperate in good faith with human rights and other nongovernmental organizations, and sees as goals for his office the restoration of trust between Chechens and federal authorities. Yet it is unlikely that his efforts will contribute to trust or accountability for past abuses because of the reasons stated above, because of his reflexive mistrust of information provided by Chechen refugees, and because of his tendency to dismiss allegations brought to him by NGOs for formalistic reasons. In our 9 March meeting with Mr. Kalamanov, his comments about Chechen refugees gave us the impression that we were talking about two entirely different groups of people. Whereas Human Rights Watch has chosen its own witnesses, has had great difficulty finding witnesses willing to speak to us, and encountered many people reluctant to speak freely because of their deep fear of retaliation, Mr. Kalamanov claimed that refugee camps were teeming with people with a vested interest in spreading disinformation, and he rejected the notion that anyone would be afraid to come forward. To be sure, our discussion with Mr. Kalamanov was friendly and constructive; his cynicism about the sources of information about abuses, however, was profoundly disturbing. Mr. Kalamanov took pride at the prospect of having two Council of Europe staff people on his team, and made it quite clear both that they would be answerable only to him and that the political atmosphere would not allow him to further internationalize his staff. Limiting contact between Council of Europe staff and their home institution would hinder and not foster the transparency, to which Mr. Kalamanov committed himself at many points during our conversation. Mr. Kalamanov's hopes to rebuild trust and communication between Chechens and the federal authorities are unlikely to see fruition if his staff is not further internationalized. In our own field experience, we have found that ethnic Chechens are often unwilling to speak in the presence of our ethnic Russian staff. Chechens are likely to deeply mistrust any effort brought uniquely by Russian authorities, even if Mr. Kalamanov's field representative in Znamenskoye, in northern Chechnya are ethnic Chechens. Those who have suffered or were witnesses to the most serious and sensitive kinds of contact abuse--such as summary executions, torture, and rape--would be unlikely to come forward unless they were assured that some other institution stood by the effort and would stand ready to protect their safety.  At the time of our visit, Mr. Kalamanov's office had not yet begun its work in earnest, and we relayed to him that the international community would be looking to it as an indicator of Russia's commitment to accountability. Yet, regrettably, he faces two very serious obstacles at the outset: a procuracy not committed to investigation of war crimes and the lack of a high-level political commitment to accountability. We would therefore urge you not to view the appointment of Mr. Kalamanov, even with international experts on his staff, as a substitute for measures that U.N. Commission member states could take to call Russia to account for the worst abuses perpetrated in this armed conflict. It is now incumbent upon the members of the U.N. Commission to make use of this body's unique role as the international community's largest and most important forum for the promotion of human rights. Accordingly, we ask you to initiate or sponsor a resolution at the Commission that would condemn the abuses, particularly the summary executions, committed so far, and that would call for a sustained and thorough investigation conducted by a team of U.N. investigators. While Human Rights Watch would welcome any progress made toward deploying the existing mandate rapporteurs to the region, the magnitude of the abuse in this conflict and the complexity of the Russian context argue for a longer-term involvement.  Representatives of Human Rights Watch will be in Geneva during the Commission session and would welcome an opportunity to discuss with your staff our recent findings, as well as these recommendations. In the meantime, should you desire further details of our conversations in Moscow, please contact my deputy, Rachel Denber, who participated in those meetings. She can be reached in our New York office, at +1-212-216-1266. We appreciate your continued leadership in efforts to address these serious human rights concerns.

Human Rights Watch documented 96 cases of rape by Serbian and Yugoslav forces against Kosovar Albanian women immediately before and during the 1999 bombing campaign, and believes that many more incidents of rape have gone unreported. The report said that rapes were not rare and isolated acts committed by individuals, but rather were used deliberately as an instrument to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and push people to flee their homes. Virtually all of the sexual assaults Human Rights Watch has documented were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. The 37-page report is the first to combine all credible reporting on rape during the Kosovo conflict, and includes a map (in PDF format)of all documented incidents of rape in Kosovo. """"These are not occasional incidents committed by a few crazy men,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Rape was used as an instrument of war in Kosovo, and it should be punished as such. The men who committed these terrible crimes must be brought to justice."""" Human Rights Watch said its research did not confirm the allegations that Serbian and Yugoslav forces had set up """"rape camps"""" in Pec or Djakovica. The organization criticized NATO, the U.S. government, and the British government for spreading unconfirmed information about rape while the NATO bombing campaign was underway. Since the end of the war, rapes of Serbian, Albanian, and Roma women by ethnic Albanians -- sometimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) -- have also been documented. Human Rights Watch condemns these human rights violations and continues to document post-conflict abuses for future reports. However, rapes and other crimes of sexual violence committed since the NATO-led troops entered Kosovo are beyond the scope of this report. The report says that rapes in Kosovo took three basic forms: rapes in women's homes, rapes during flight, and rapes in detention. In the first category, security forces entered private homes and raped women either in the yard, in front of family members, or in an adjoining room. In the second category, internally displaced people wandering on foot and riding on tractors were repeatedly stopped, robbed, and threatened by the Yugoslav Army, Serbian police, or paramilitaries. If families could not produce cash, security forces told them that their daughters would be taken away and raped; in some cases, even when families did provide money, their daughters were taken away. The third category of rapes took place in temporary detention centers, such as abandoned homes or barns. The majority of rape cases were evidently committed by Serbian paramilitaries, who wore various uniforms and often had bandanas, long knives, long hair, and beards. These paramilitary formations worked closely with official government forces, either the Serbian Ministry of Interior or the Yugoslav Army, throughout Kosovo. In several cases, victims and witnesses identified the perpetrators as Serbian special police, in blue or blue camouflage uniforms, or Yugoslav Army soldiers, in green military uniforms. Several rape victims actually reported the crimes to Yugoslav military officers. Human Rights Watch called on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to indict not only the perpetrators of rape, but also their commanding officers. """"Women in Kosovo are waiting for justice, and so far none of the Kosovo indictments have included sex crimes,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch. """"The sooner there are investigations and prosecutions, the sooner these women can begin to rebuild their lives."""" Human Rights Watch was able to interview six rape victims in depth, and their testimonies are contained in this report. Human Rights Watch met two other women who acknowledged that they had been raped but refused to give testimony. Human Rights Watch documented six cases of women who were raped and subsequently killed. The ninety-six cases also include rape reports deemed reliable by Human Rights Watch that were compiled by other nongovernmental organizations. Human Rights Watch believes that the actual number of women raped in Kosovo between March and June 1999 is much higher than ninety-six. Due to strong social taboos, Kosovar Albanian victims of rape are generally reluctant to speak about their experiences, and those who remained in Kosovo throughout the conflict may not have had an opportunity to report abuses. TESTIMONIES OF RAPE VICTIMS FROM KOSOVO Women and girls were pulled from lines of refugees and sexually assaulted, sometimes in front of other refugees. B.B., a twenty-two year old woman from Mitrovica told Human Rights Watch: It happened while I was in line with the people. It was April 14th when we left our house and on the 15th we were walking near Djakovica... We met Serb paramilitaries. ..They approached my uncle and separated him. They took his gold and his money from him. Then they came up to me...He took my hand and told me to get in his car. ... He told me not to refuse or there would be lots of victims. He swore at me and said, """"Whore, get in the car..."""" He told me not to scream and to take off my clothes. He took off his clothes and told me to suck his thing. I did not know what to do. He took my head and put it near him. He started to beat me. I lost consciousness. When I came to I saw him over me. I had great pain. I was screaming and scratching the ground from the pain. Another man came with a car and he got over me. The other man with the car asked the first one why he was treating this whore so good. I was crying from the pain and he was laughing the whole time. The second one got off me and told me to put on my clothes. I couldn't find them. Just as I got dressed another one came and took me to another place a couple of meters away and he started with the same words and did the same things the first one did. He kept me there for several minutes and then told me to wear my clothes so I [looked like I did when I left the line]. He told me not to tell anyone or they would take me for good and shoot my family. The men wore masks. They wore camouflage clothes and they were carrying weapons and knives on their belts. They said that they were paid to do this. I begged him [the first rapist] to kill me but he didn't want to. Z.T., a twenty-three-year-old woman, was being held in a house in Drenica by special Serbian forces: I was held in a room full of women. The police came, and gestured for me to come. A policeman made me take off my clothes and he found a note that I was hiding in my underwear on which I had my husband's telephone number in Switzerland. He tore up the note and started swearing at me. I went back to the group of women and the same policeman came back and said, """"come here."""" He took me far away from the other women and did whatever he wanted with me. A group of twenty-seven women in the Drenica region were held by Serb paramilitaries in a small barn. -V.B., a twenty-one year old, was seven months pregnant when she was gang raped by Serb paramilitaries: They put us in a small barn with hay in it. Then the four men came into the barn and slammed the door and pointed machine guns at us. They asked for gold, money, and whatever we had. We gave whatever we had. But they were still torturing us. They would take a girl, they kept her outside for half an hour, and after that they would bring one back and then they would take another. Then they took me. I was pregnant. I was holding my son. They took him away from me and gave him to my mother. They told me to get up and follow them. I was crying and screaming, """"Take me back to my child!"""" They took me to another room. It was so bad I almost fainted. I can't say the words they said. They tortured me. Because I was pregnant, they asked me where my husband was... One of them said to another soldier, """"Kick her and make the baby abort."""" They did this to me four times-they took me outside to the other place. Three men took me one by one. Then they asked me, """"Are you desperate for your husband?"""" and said, """"Here we are instead of him."""" In Pec, six armed and uniformed Serb men entered a house two days before NATO entered the city. Before murdering six members of her family, the men raped one of the women, a twenty-eight year old mother. Her sister-in-law witnessed the rape and the murders: They were wearing military clothes and had black scarves on their heads. They took my sister-in-law into the front room, and they were hitting her and telling her to shut up. The children were screaming, and they also screamed at the children. She was with the paramilitary for one half- hour. She was resisting, and they beat her, and the children could hear her screaming. I could only hear what was going on. I heard them slapping her. The children did not understand that they were raping her. After they raped my sister-in-law, they put her in line with us and shot her.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Every year since 1993, the U.S. State Department's Annual Report on Human Rights has began with the same sentence: """"Turkmenistan, a one-party state dominated by its president and his closest advisers, made little progress in moving from a Soviet-era authoritarian style of government to a democratic system."""" Yet, despite the U.S. government's yearly acknowledgement of the Niyazov government's dismal human rights record, the U.S. continues to support the dictatorship in order to secure its participation in a Trans-Caspian gas pipeline. Indeed, this hearing comes at time when Turkmenistan has been in the news, not for its devolution into a North Korea-style dictatorship-for-life, but because it has challenged the terms of its participation in the gas pipeline. This singular pursuit of a pipeline has led to the unfortunate situation in which U.S. policy towards Turkmenistan since its independence has been driven energy interests to the detriment of all other goals, including the promotion of human rights and democracy. Yet anyone who follows developments in the country might easily have predicted that the government's utter disrespect for the rule of law has implications for international involvement in its energy sector, as well as for its political fate. Human Rights Watch has reported on human rights in Turkmenistan since 1990. Early in 1999, after several years of being denied visas, U.S. diplomatic pressure helped to secure an official government invitation for Human Rights Watch to meet with Turkmen officials and to carry out research. Our visit was cut short when Turkmen state security officials detained and summarily deported our colleague Alexander Petrov, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Moscow office and a Russian citizen, late on the night of February 2. Subsequent efforts to gain entry to the country have not been successful, yet we continue to monitor the situation through interviews with Turkmen both in the country and abroad. Human Rights in Turkmenistan The catalogue of human rights abuses in Turkmenistan is extensive and well-documented, and amounts to a total lack of basic civil and political freedoms. It is a country without an independent press, without political parties, and where the price of a critical opinion voiced aloud can be prison. The all-powerful state security service ensures that no Turkmen citizen can exercise their right to freely associate, breaking up the tiniest private gathering of persons suspected of critical ideas. When Human Rights Watch traveled to Turkmenistan, the few dissident intellectuals in the country were warned not to meet with our delegation before we even arrived, and those who did were immediately debriefed and threatened by state security forces. In one instance, a security agent enforcing the house arrest of one dissident, Durdymurad Khojamuhammedov sat listening during our interview as an on-the-spot censor. For those who fall afoul of security officials or police, the right to fair trial is utterly lacking. Credible reports document the routine use of torture to extract confessions; the accused are routinely deprived of all due process rights. All judges are appointed by President Niyazov. Though at the end of 1999 Turkmenistan abandoned its use of the death penalty, the most basic right, the right to life to life, remains under threat. Unthinkable prison conditions and the ghastly overcrowding and brutality prevalent in prisons and places of pre-trial detention make any period of arrest tantamount to a possible death sentence, according to eye-witness testimony. Of all the post-Soviet states, Turkmenistan has placed the most draconian restrictions on the rights of its ethnic Russian minority, slashing access to employment, education and information, in addition to impeding their efforts to emigrate. Finally, in Turkmenistan alone of all other New Independent States, neither Turkmen citizens nor international monitors can effectively monitor the observance of human rights. State-sponsored repression makes the formation of local human rights groups impossible; the imposition of a strict visa regime even for CIS citizens has kept international human rights NGOs out of the country since the spring of 1999. Turn for the Worse in 1999 In 1999, the unimaginable happened, and Turkmenistan's bad human rights situation worsened further still. In preparation for December parliamentary elections in which all candidates would be pre-approved by the President, Turkmenistan arrested two government critics who had voiced their intention to run for office. Both men, former education official Ayli Meredov and Dr. Pirikuli Tangrykuliev, were convicted of criminal offenses; while Meredov was immediately amnestied, Tangrykuliev was sentenced to eight years in prison. In September, the political prisoner Khoshali Garaev, aged thirty-seven, was reported dead after being placed in solitary confinement by prison authorities, who unconvincingly claimed Garaev committed suicide but refused the family's request for an independent investigation. The anti-religious assault became more vicious. State authorities stepped up their harassment of mostly Protestant activists, and even bulldozed churches and temples. Members of outlawed religious congregations who are foreign nationals have been assaulted, detained and deported, while Turkmen nationals face even more severe consequences: Shagildy Atakov was sentenced to four years in prison for his religious activity; he is now reportedly being held in solitary confinement in the punishment cell of the labor camp where he is serving his sentence. Pressure on exiled dissidents, political and religious prisoners via attacks on their family members has increased. Family members have been dismissed from their jobs, blacklisted from institutions of higher learning, and banished to internal exile; their homes, businesses and other property have been confiscated. Finally, on the eve of the new year, the Turkmen legislature flaunted its OSCE commitments to implement democratic reform when it confirmed the long-anticipated removal of term limits, effectively designating Saparmurad Niyazov as Turkmenistan's president for life. On January 5, longtime democratic activist Nurberdi Nurmamedov, leader of the never-registered political party Agzybirlik (Unity) was arrested on spurious criminal charges in retaliation for his criticism of this move.  U.S. Policy The U.S. has pursued a two-track policy towards Turkmenistan, and those tracks run in opposite directions. On the one hand, diplomats in Ashgabat relay criticism of Turkmenistan's abuses, and direct assistance to strictly apolitical local non-governmental organizations. On the other, the US. carries out aggressive diplomacy to promote the trans-Caspian pipeline, steadfastly rejecting any suggestion that the two tracks should be linked. The chronology of economic assistance provided through the U.S. Export-Import Bank, almost entirely for Turkmen government-controlled projects, which has now reached a total of $313,409,764, clearly shows which track enjoys the right-of-way: In 1995, desperate citizens staged a peaceful demonstration against the previous year's falsified parliamentary elections and presidential referendum in the capital Ashgabat. Scores were arrested, beaten, and eye-witnesses reported that many demonstrators died in detention. As many as thirty demonstrators and other activists were sentenced to prison. At the same time, Turkmenistan received over seventy-eight million dollars in loan guarantees through Ex-Im Bank.  In 1996, Turkmenistan committed three government critics to psychiatric hospitals without medical necessity, and received one hundred nine million dollars in new loan guarantees.  In 1997, Turkmenistan began to outlaw and harass many religious congregations other than the dominant Sunni Islam and Russian Orthodoxy, after introducing restrictive new amendments to its law on Religion late in the previous year. The U.S. provided over one hundred thirty-three million dollars in new loan guarantees through Export-Import Bank.  In 1998, the pattern continued. On March 10, preceding Niyazov's visit to the United States, the Export-Import Bank awarded U.S.$96 million three U.S. companies in order to sell natural gas compression equipment and other services to Turkmenistan. Later, President Niyazov released some political prisoners on the eve of his April meeting with President Clinton, but continued to beat, harass and arrest others. One political prisoner died in custody under suspicious circumstances. During his April visit, government officials reported having raised human rights issues privately with Niyazov. At the same time, the U.S. awarded companies grants—using public funds—to get a foothold in Turkmenistan. During a meeting between Presidents Clinton and Niyazov on April 23, the U.S. government's Trade and Development Administration (U.S.T.D.A.) awarded a $750,000 grant to conduct a pipeline feasibility study for a proposed $2.8 billion pipeline in Turkmenistan. After the deal was signed, the White House issued a press release stating, """"Turkmenistan is committed to strengthening the rule of law and political pluralism, including free and fair elections for parliament and the presidency in accordance with international standards...."""" But when reporters asked Niyazov about the government's attitude toward opposition parties, he said, """"We do not have any opposition parties—you are ill-informed. We have none."""" As we have seen recently, rather than holding democratic elections, President Niyazov has been declared """"President-for-Life."""" In 1999, no new loan guarantees were provided through the Export-Import Bank, though economic assistance continued in other guises. More disturbingly, even as Turkmenistan jailed more government critics, the U.S. government's two-track diplomacy continued to undercut its message on human rights. Six days after the sentencing of Turkmen dissident Pirikuli Tangrykuliev to eight years imprisonment on August 14, U.S. Secretary of Energy Richardson, John Wolf, the special advisor to the president and secretary of state for Caspian Basin Energy Diplomacy and J. Joseph Grandmaison, the director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency met with President Niyazov to discuss the proposed trans-Caspian gas pipeline and to release a U.S. $150,000 grant so that the Turkmen government could """"formulate documents"""" related to the project. The U.S. government waited until August 23--three days after Richardson left the country—to issue a condemnation of Tangrykuliev's conviction. On January 18, as Special Advisor Wolf was again meeting with President Niyazov, Turkmen officials charged Nurberdi Nurmamedov's 25-year old son Murad as an accomplice to his father's crimes. Nurmamedov and his son were sentenced on February 25, but the State Department waited to condemn the sentence for nearly three weeks, issuing a statement only last Friday, March 17, after a flurry of meetings between Ambassador-at-Large Wolf and senior Turkmen officials on the fate of the pipeline agreement. Recommendations Clearly, any U.S. criticism of Turkmenistan's human rights abuses is belied by continued U.S. taxpayer-funded support for the Turkmen government. In the absence of concrete consequences for Turkmenistan's egregious failure to uphold its international and bilateral committments, the government of President Niyazov has no incentive whatsoever to reform. Human Rights Watch strongly urges that conditionality for any form of non-humanitarian assistance to Turkmenistan, particularly new Ex-Im credits for any purpose, must be strict. Currently, they are weak, and even minimal human rights considerations required by Ex-Im Bank policy, for example, are seemingly ignored. Two years ago we examined the policy that obliges the State Department to conduct a human rights """"impact assessment"""" for the Export-Import Bank of the United States whenever financing of more than $10 million is under consideration. The assessment is supposed to examine """"the general status of human rights and the effect of the export on human rights in the importing country."""" We filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the review of a 1998 financing package to Turkmenistan: a $96 million loan guarantee extended to three U.S. companies for gas pipeline refurbishment. In this case, the human rights assessment did not seem to have examined the impact of extending funds on human rights and clearly did not account for the government of Turkmenistan's appalling human rights record, a situation regularly noted in the State Department's own human rights country reports. Rather, the assessment was minimal and consists of a State Department official's signature of approval beside the words """"Human Rights."""" Language in the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires the creation of a mechanism to assess the human rights implications of all Export-Import Bank projects and to monitor the human rights impact. The Ex-Im Bank was given 120 days following the passage of the Act to report to Congress on the implementation of such a system, we hope that they will do so in a timely manner and place a priority on implementation in regards to projects involving Turkmenistan. Similarly, provisions of the 1998 Religious Freedom Act, which provide for a broad array of possible measures to be taken against governments which brutally persecute religious believers, should also be invoked against Turkmenistan. There are many reasons, aside from the demands of U.S. law, that economic assistance to Turkmenistan should be conditioned upon respect for human rights and democratic reforms. Such conditionality is the necessary first step in promoting real political and economic reform, of critical importance not only to Turkmenistan but to U.S. strategic interests as well. Given the fact that Turkmenistan's hydrocarbon resources are controlled by an abusive, undemocratic government, which operates with a total lack of transparency, fostering pipeline construction alone will not lead to the creation of democratic states. Nor will it lead to the long-term stability in the region, particularly when public funds are indiscriminately extended to such an abusive government. In the absence of democratic institutions Turkmenistan's post-Niyazov era will likely be marked by vicious internecine battles to control state resources. Without a redoubled effort to ensure adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights, including clear and verifiable human rights conditionalities on financing it is unclear how the situation will improve. Rather than make energy interests and human rights mutually exclusive goals, we urge you to ensure that human rights are not sidelined in favor of pipelines; and believe that creating democratic institutions, fostering the rule of law, and ensuring respect for human rights are good for the strategic and energy interests of the U.S. government, and a responsible use of taxpayer funds.","Europe/Central Asia, Turkmenistan",""

But the policies espoused by India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP, and its sister organizations are equally insidious. They have already resulted in much violence against India's Christian, Muslim and Dalit, or ''untouchable,'' minorities. When President Bill Clinton meets with India's leaders, he must put pressure on the government to reverse this dangerous trend: The BJP , are dedicated to recruiting young boys and men. They give them extensive physical and ideological training, creating disciples full of ''Hindu fervor'' and military-like discipline. Caste violence is also increasing. On March 12, seven Dalits were burned to death in a rural village in Karnataka, reportedly in retaliation for the killing of an upper-caste youth. Although ''untouchability'' was abolished by the Indian constitution in 1950, some 160 million Dalits are denied access to land, forced to work in degrading conditions and routinely abused or even killed by the police and higher-caste groups that enjoy the state's protection. In what has been called India's ''hidden apartheid,'' entire villages remain completely segregated by caste. This issue is as critical in India today as was the movement for racial equality and civil rights in the United States in the 1960s. The United States should use every opportunity to raise the problem of caste-based violence and discrimination. Mr. Clinton should also pressure the Indian government to prosecute both state and private actors responsible for attacks on religious minorities and Dalits. Kashmir is a key issue for Washington on this visit. But here again, the BJP's jingoistic policies are playing a role. Indian security forces use brutality and terror to reign over Indian-controlled Kashmir, while Pakistan continues to support and train militant groups that target and assassinate security personnel and innocent civilians. India and the United States recently formed a joint working group on counterterrorism. But before he considers any joint strategies, the president should be aware that the government has introduced controversial anti-terrorism legislation that circumvents due process in the name of national security. India has been down this road before. The current criminal law amendment bill is a modified version of a 1985 law that led to tens of thousands of unjustified arrests, political abuses, torture and other violations against political opposition and human rights defenders. That law was repealed in 1995, but if the new bill is passed, it is likely to be similarly misused. Mr. Clinton's trip is properly highlighting regional security concerns, from nuclear proliferation to the conflict in Kashmir to the military coup in Pakistan. But far too little attention has been paid to the dangers for both India and its neighbors of the divisive Hindu nationalist policies that are subverting Indian democracy from within.

Rights Commission Urged to Act on China","","03/17/2000","(Geneva)—Human Rights Watch today urged the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to hold China accountable for widespread abuses and to investigate Russian atrocities in Chechnya. The organization made the appeal on the eve of the Commission's annual six-week meeting, which will start in Geneva on Monday, March 20.  """"There has a been a sharp downturn in human rights in China that requires a strong multilateral response."""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch. """"China is closing down virtually every possible source of peaceful opposition. Dialogue alone is not sufficient.""""  Weschler noted that U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson had recently expressed dismay at a """"deterioration"""" in China 's rights record in fundamental areas, especially the rights to freedom of expression, religion and association.  The group also called on the Commission to respond to Russian atrocities in Chechnya. """"Our researchers have uncovered a pattern of Russian war crimes, including the summary executions of civilians throughout Grozny,"""" said Weschler. """"The situation demands a thorough and in-depth U.N. investigation. The Commission in Geneva cannot look the other way.""""  Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring group based in New York. It conducts investigations into human rights abuses in about 70 countries and publishes its findings in dozens of reports every year. It is entirely privately-funded.  Human Rights Watch also called on the Commission to name an envoy to monitor the treatment of human rights defenders around the world. """"In the last year, at least six human rights activists were killed because of their work, and many more were imprisoned or threatened. In several countries, no independent human rights monitoring is even allowed,"""" said Weschler. """"It's time the United Nations took real action to protect those who are risking their lives for the rights of others."""" The envoy would build on the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly in December 1998.  Human Rights Watch also urged the Commission to:   call on the Indonesian government to provide continued protection and assistance to East Timorese refugees in West Timor and to prosecute militia members who continue to intimidate, harass, and attack refugees and humanitarian aid workers;  urge U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to continue international investigations into atrocities in East Timor until the perpetrators and planners of the violence, including the most senior culpable Indonesian security officials, are brought to justice;  appoint a Special Rapporteur to look into the """"rapid and severe deterioration of human rights"""" in Uzbekistan;  urge the UN human rights observers, deployed as part of the UN operation in Sierra Leone, to report promptly and publicly on current abuses affecting all civilians, including internally displaced persons, women and children; and  urge the U.N. leadership to be responsive to the human rights observers' reporting;  assure that the special rapporteur on the Democratic Republic of Congo, Roberto Garretَn, has the mandate and the resources to investigate alleged massacres committed in 1996-97 by forces loyal to Laurent Kabila. Kabila blocked previous U.N. teams from carrying out the probe, but recently invited them back;  move forward in drafting a convention against """"disappearances;"""" approve the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child barring the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflict; request the United States to turn over to Haitian prosecutors materials seized from Haiti's army and death squads in 1994;  appoint a monitor on violence against children to observe adherence to the standards protecting children and to investigate abuses. Human Rights Watch said that in China, groups such as """"Corruption Watch"""" and the China Democracy Party have been singled out for detentions and in some cases, severe prison sentences. Leaders of worker and peasant organizations, as well as those trying to peacefully organize workers or protesting corruption, have been arrested. The crackdown on the Falun Gong movement that began last July has resulted in widespread violations of basic rights of free expression, association and belief. At least 111 Falun Gong members, according to Chinese officials, have been formally arrested, charged with establishing an illegal organization, organizing illegal gatherings, and using the Internet to promote Falun Gong's message. The organization said that it was also deeply concerned about serious abuses in Tibet, including beatings, torture and government interference with Buddhist religious activities, as well as the impact of draconian measures imposed against alleged terrorists in Xinjiang such as increasing executions and lengthy prison terms for suspected """"splittists.""""  Since the beginning of the conflict in Chechnya, Russian forces have indiscriminately and disproportionately bombed and shelled civilian objects, causing heavy civilian casualties. Their bombing campaign has turned many parts of Chechnya to a wasteland. On February 5, Russian forces went on a killing spree in the Aldi district of Grozny, shooting at least sixty-two and possibly many more civilians. Human Rights Watch has documented two other massacres by Russian forces in Chechnya. In the past month, the Russian authorities have taken more than a thousand men to undisclosed detention facilities, where victims say they have been beaten and tortured.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, China and Tibet, Russia","United Nations"

The bill, approved by both chambers of Congress during the final months of the Frei administration, allows former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to retire from his position as lifetime senator, without forfeiting his parliamentary immunity. The bill is likely to be endorsed in a joint congressional session on March 25, and could become law unless Lagos withdraws his support.  Human Rights Watch warned that the proposed revision could have a serious, if unintended, impact on the criminal prosecution of General Pinochet. The former dictator faces more than seventy law suits in Chile for extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" and torture. The Santiago Appeals Court must now rule whether Pinochet's parliamentary immunity should be lifted so that he may stand trial. If the court rules that it should, Pinochet may appeal to the Supreme Court. If the appeals court finds in favor of Pinochet, the case against him cannot progress further.  Human rights lawyers representing Pinochet's victims fear that the reform could give Pinochet an extra layer of protection if he were now to resign from the Senate, since no explicit provision exists in Chilean law for lifting the immunity of a former president. """"This reform represents untested ground, and it could offer a legal loophole for Pinochet,"""" warned Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. The broader impact of the reform also worried Human Rights Watch. Most Latin American constitutions give members of the legislature and/or public officials immunity from arrest or prosecution, but these privileges terminate when they leave office and are designed to allow them to carry out their legitimate public responsibilities. No country offers immunity to former heads of state. """"This is a very dangerous precedent for the region,"""" said Vivanco. """"It goes against the increasingly widely accepted principle that heads of state must answer for human rights violations before the courts. Immunity cannot be handed out as a prize to former rulers, even good ones."""" Apart from offering General Pinochet an incentive to resign from the Senate, the reform is intended to rectify the situation of former President Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994). Under Chile's 1980 Constitution, Aylwin did not qualify for the benefits due lifetime senators since he served only a four-year term. There has been almost no debate in Chile about the long-term implications of the constitutional amendment.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/16/china-religion-service-state","China- Religion in the Service of the State","China: Religion in the Service of the State","Statement by Mickey Spiegel, Consultant to Human Rights Watch, to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom","03/16/2000","We appreciate the opportunity to testify before this distinguished commission on the state of religious freedom in China. Beginning in 1991, Human Rights Watch issued a series of reports on freedom of religion in China and Tibet. They include Freedom of Religion in China (1992), Religious Repression in China Persists (1992), Continuing Religious Repression in China (1993), Detained in China and Tibet: A Directory of Political and Religious Prisoners (1994), Persecution of a Protestant Sect in China (1994), No Progress on Human Rights (1994), Cutting Off the Serpent's Head: Tightening Control in Tibet, 1994-1995 (1996), and China: State Control of Religion (1997). We have briefed many delegations to China on the issue of religious freedom, including the official delegation of U.S. religious leaders who traveled there in February 1998.   In my testimony today I will describe the policy statements, laws and regulations, and bureaucratic structures that restrict the right of China's citizens to """"freedom of thought, conscience and religion...and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance,"""" as enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   I will describe the differences in the application of China's religious policy over time, from locale to locale, and with respect to different faiths and belief structures. Finally, I will present our recommendations for steps the Commission could take in its attempt to foster religious freedom in China.   The promise of religious freedom in the PRC   At first glance, the promises of """"freedom of religious belief"""" and protection of """"normal religious activities"""" in Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China seem consistent with international standards. In practice, however, Chinese authorities have tolerated religion only to the extent that they have been able to harness it to ruling Chinese Communist Party goals, including economic development. The Chinese leadership has never made any secret of the fact that China is an atheist state, and the expectation remains that, at some future date, religion will wither and die. In the meantime, religious activity has continued to be strictly controlled along lines dictated by political calculation. Chinese policies reflect the premise that religion cannot be allowed to grow unchecked; it must be free of foreign influences or alleged """"hostile domestic forces"""" that could destabilize China; it must adapt itself to socialism; its leaders' first allegiance must be to the state; future religious leaders must be carefully vetted before they are permitted to become serious students.   One reason for the ever stricter control is the growth in the number of believers and in the number of sites for religious activity in the PRC and the perceived potential for destabilization. At the same national Religious Affairs Bureau conference in early January 2000 at which the official policy on management of religion was reiterated by Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councillor Ismail Amat, a new policy document was issued calling for tighter oversight of all religions. In the face of the growing interest in religion in urban areas and among the young, domains previously without a strong religious tradition, the impetus to further channel and control all religious expression continues to grow concomitantly.   A set of policies and a series of laws and regulations interfere with freedom of belief. Dual government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) bureaucracies and an intricate and interlocking set of national, provincial, and county regulations serve to narrow the meaning of """"normal"""" as applied to religious activities.   Freedom of belief is compromised first by the PRC policy of recognizing only five religions, Buddhism, Daoism, Catholicism, Christianity (Protestantism), and Islam, and labeling other belief structures """"feudal"""" or """"superstitious"""" or both. Popular religion which claims the loyalties of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese population and blends Daoist, Buddhist, and polytheistic elements is ignored. Insistence that all Chinese Protestants be represented under one """"post-denominational"""" church ignores key differences among various Protestant groups on matters of ritual, ideology, and doctrine. This policy is also a clear example of government interference with freedom of belief.   Article 300 of the Criminal Law as amended in 1997 further erodes the international standard. By stipulating punishment for organizers and for those who """"make use of"""" so-called superstitious sects or cults and so-called evil religious organizations, the law arrogates to the central government and to the CCP the right to decide, on whatever grounds they choose, to legitimize or delegitimize a particular belief system. A series of interpretations in October 1999 went even further, pressing for harsh punishment for those the government chooses to label heterodox. There have been reports that the law is being interpreted to crack down on non-mainstream Protestant congregations such as the China Evangelistic Fellowship in Henan province.   The constitutional promise to protect """"normal"""" religious activities is so hemmed in by regulations as to make the promise almost meaningless. In 1991, Document No.6, """"Circular from Party Central and the State Council Concerning Certain Problems in Further Improving Religious Work,"""" by endorsing registration as a means of control, eroded the right to manifest belief in the company of like-minded others without explicit government approval. In 1994, several sets of State Council regulations were issued, including """"Regulations Regarding the Management of Places of Religious Activities"""" and """"Registration Procedures for Venues for Religious Activities."""" These regulations institutionalized registration and criminalized congregations, churches, temples, or mosques which refused to register or were refused registration. Should such religious gatherings persist, they could be closed or heavily fined and their members subject to punishment by public security organs.   Registered congregations, on the other hand, must tolerate the state's secular oversight. They must agree to permit official scrutiny of their membership; cede some control over the choice of clergy; open their financial records to government scrutiny; restrict their contacts with other religious institutions; accept limits on some activities, such as youth or social welfare programs, or building projects; eschew evangelism; allow censorship of religious materials and interference with doctrinal thought; and limit religious activities to approved sites. How these regulations are interpreted varies from place to place and province to province. Some local officials are more tolerant; others interpret the regulations strictly.   The Chinese leadership also controls religious belief and practice through regulations that are not specifically geared to religious institutions, such as regulations governing the right to form a social organization, freedom of assembly, land use, and internal migration.   The role of the official religious bureaucracy   The dual bureaucratic structure, centered in the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work   Department and the state's Religious Affairs Bureau, is responsible for implementing and administering overall religious policy after it is set by the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the country's top decision-making body. """"Patriotic Associations,"""" one or more of which have been created for each of the five recognized religions, help manage the relationship between church and state. As such, they function as additional instruments of control.   Rule of law   As the centerpiece of its control mechanism, registration has allowed the government to claim that religion in China is regulated by law, and that those who are punished are punished not for their religious beliefs but for breaking the law. Over the past ten years, this so-called rule of law has gradually displaced a more arbitrary repressive system that featured ad hoc detentions, arrests, judicial and administrative sentences, enforced reeducation sessions, disappearances, beatings, and fines. Those targeted found their movements and contacts strictly monitored; some lost their jobs; their children were expelled from school. Although religious activists are still detained and arrested, fewer are sent to labor camps or given long prison sentences, rather they are repeatedly harassed or picked up for short periods, then released without charge.   The differences between the two systems are sometimes hard to distinguish. Under the current """"rule of law"""" system, a carefully drawn up set of legal guidelines authorizes detention, arrest, judicial and administrative sentencing, and other methods previously used under the old ad hoc system. The 1997 campaign in Tongxiang municipality (Zhejiang province) to """"curb the illegal activities of Catholic and Protestant Christians according to law,"""" and the 1996 Donglai township (Jiangxi province) plan for """"curbing the illegal activities of the underground Catholic church according to law"""" are cases in point.   The crackdown on the Falun Gong, a worldwide organization whose members aim to improve their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being through exercise and meditation is yet another example. The Chinese government's highly organized and intensive campaign meditation, which exploded on July 22, 1999, employs a series of legal maneuvers that flouts international standards but allows the Chinese government to claim that it's crackdown is based on the rule of law. According to reports, some still unconfirmed, Falun Gong members have been detained, forcibly re-educated, and sentenced to long terms, and many have been harshly treated by security forces. Other have lost their jobs or their pensions.   Overall, there has been a shift in Chinese religious policy away from seemingly random acts of persecution, in which any practitioner might be targeted, to mass campaigns aimed at relatively   large-scale and coordinated groups operating outside the aegis of official control or at repeat offenders who lead small congregations. Notable mass campaigns have been aimed at the so- called underground Catholic church, attacked because it has refused to put allegiance to the state before allegiance to the Pope and the Universal Church, and because its members are concentrated in several discrete locales such as the area around Balding in Hebei province; the Protestant house churches whose doctrines, lay leadership, and evangelical impetus disallow official recognition and registration; and so-called cults or sects, as defined by the Chinese leadership.   It should be noted, however, that the central government continues to act in an arbitrary and repressive manner when it so chooses. For example, seven elderly Catholic bishops were """"disappeared"""" in an apparent attempt to force their allegiance to the official church (""""official"""" or """"open"""" church refers to all registered and, therefore, legal Protestant or Catholic congregations) and to bring their congregations into line. The latest incident occurred around midnight on February 10, 2000 when Archbishop Yang Shudao of Fuzhou, Fujian province, was seized by some 150 public security officers. His whereabouts and those of six other bishops remain undisclosed. According to excerpts from an August 16, 1999 official high-level Chinese document, these recent abductions appear to be part of a carefully orchestrated effort aimed at the complete destabilization of the underground church in preparation for the normalization of relations between China and the Vatican. The January 6, 2000 ordination without Vatican approval of five young patriotic bishops was an additional step in the plan. The arbitrary detentions of at least ninety-five Protestant house church leaders in early 1999 is another case in point, as is the repeated detention and ill-treatment of Li Dexian in Guangzhou.   Tibet   State interference with religion is extensive in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and in """"eastern Tibet,"""" that is, the traditionally Tibetan areas of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces. Those wishing to become monks or nuns face a series of obstacles. They cannot do so officially until they turn 18; they must be approved by secular authorities: and they must fit within the total number of monks and nuns permitted in the TAR and within the cap placed on the number in a particular monastery or nunnery.   Monks and nuns who refuse to be reeducated along the patriotic lines laid out by the top Chinese leadership face expulsion from their monasteries and nunneries with no provisions for re-admission. The requirements include renunciation of support for the Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism; acceptance of and demonstrated support for the Chinese-chosen Panchen Lama, the second most important Tibetan religious leader; and agreement that Tibet has always been an integral part of China. Some monks have been arrested for their resistance to reeducation; others have died. Thousands have been expelled from the monasteries. In mid-1999, Sonam Phuntsog, a gifted scholar and teacher, was detained, reportedly for his loyalty to the Dalai Lama. Legshe Tsoglam, a monk, died in April 1999, a few days after he was released from Gutsa Detention Center. Where resistance to re-education is particularly strong, nunneries or monasteries may be closed temporarily or even permanently.   In addition, monastic leadership is in the hands of Democratic Management Teams whose members are vetted for political reliability. Some religious festivals have been banned outright and others have been converted to secular celebrations; commemoration of the Dalai Lama's birthday is banned and his picture may not be displayed publicly or in monasteries and nunneries. In January 2000, the Chinese government installed its own choice as Reting Rinpoche, another important Tibetan Buddhist figure. Access to ten-year-old Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the child recognized by the Dalai Lama as the Panchen Lama, continues to be denied. In January 1999, the government announced a drive to promote atheism in Tibet.   Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR)   Evidence of the religious repression of Uighurs comes from the detention and sentencing of imams in several locales who refused to include official Chinese religious propaganda and patriotic appeals in their teachings and who, therefore, deemed to have """"destroyed"""" official religious policy. In addition to these requirements, the government limits imams' freedom to interpret the Koran during religious services and has exercised its """"right"""" to close mosques and Koranic schools. In one case in Ili prefecture, Ibrahim Ismael, a religious scholar who held private classes for young Muslims, was executed.   Religious materials, including classic Islamic texts, are routinely vetted and routinely confiscated. Their publication and sale are limited. In Hotan in September 1999, Uighurs were ordered to hand over religious materials in their possession. A similar demand in March 1999 in Aksu resulted in substantial numbers of confiscated books and tapes. Teachers who are perceived to have religious leanings have lost their jobs or been demoted. Selection of those who will be trained to become imams is in the hands of the government bureaucracy, as is the content of their patriotic education. Religious personnel are made to attend courses aimed at self-education to correct past mistakes and deepen understanding of the law. Those who resist are expelled from their mosques.   According to a March 1999 report, 3,403 committees were formed in Aksu Prefecture to control the local mosques. In September, in Hotan city, control of forty-six of the city's main mosques passed to the Party Committee and the Bureau of Civil Affairs. Imams and other religious figures are required to report regularly for questioning about Party, family planning, and national unity policies.   All such restrictions on religious freedom are in line with the 1997 statement by the Deputy Chief Procurator of the XUAR who said, """"We lay stress on freedom of religious beliefs but never on 'freedom of religion.'""""   In Xinjiang there is an active independence movement among members of the Muslim Uighur community, the largest of the non-Han """"minority groups."""" The overlap of religious minority status and separatism sometimes makes it difficult to separate religious and political persecution. Human Rights Watch take no position on the question of Tibetan or Uighur independence claims, but believes that those who have views on the subject, one way or the other, should be free to   express them without suffering persecution.   Recommendations to Congress and the Administration   We urge Congress and the Administration to continue to intensify its efforts to pressure China to adhere to international human rights standards. With respect to religion, we urge that Congress and the Administration recognize that pressure to comply with Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights requires parallel pressure on China to meet similar standards with respect to freedom of expression, association and assembly.   1. U.N. Commission on Human Rights   Members of Congress and of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom should immediately urge the President and members of the Administration to lobby other governments at the highest levels urging them to support the U.S. initiative to censure China at the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights which opens on March 20 in Geneva. It would also be useful if members of the Commission informally encouraged affiliated religious groups in other countries to promote the resolution with their governments. The mounting violations of human rights in China in 1999 and 2000 have included serious violations of the right to freedom of belief. Those violations have included:  an on-going patriotic reeducation campaign in Tibet and secular control of all Tibetan Buddhist institutions;  limits on evangelical Protestantism, especially churches that feature fluid congregations under lay leadership;  an integrated plan for the destruction of the """"underground"""" Catholic church and the unification of all Catholics under the aegis of an official church aimed at eliminating all papal influence in China;  a crackdown on the practice and spread of Islam in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region;  a virulent campaign against the Falun Gong and other forms of qi gong. Detailed information about current restrictions on Buddhist and Daoist practice is unavailable. Over the past few years, however, there have been reports of the destruction of """"superfluous"""" Buddhist temples or there conversion to other uses.   2. Permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) for China:   We believe that before China receives permanent NTR, the president should certify to Congress that certain concrete, meaningful, and realistic human rights conditions have been met. For example, China might be required to:  ratify the two important UN human rights treaties it has signed, including the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which contains key guarantees of religious freedom;  review the cases of convicted """"counterrevolutionaries"""" and begin a process of dismantling the massive system of """"reeducation through labor;"""" these steps would result in the release of religious activists, among many others;  open Tibet and Xinjiang to unhindered access by international humanitarian organizations and independent human rights monitors.   3. Support for thematic U.N. mechanisms   After Abdelfattah Amor, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Religious Intolerance visited China in 1994, he made a series of recommendations to the Chinese government, none of which have been implemented. We urge the Congress and Administration to insist that the Chinese government implement his recommendations and invite him to China again, allowing him unfettered access to monitor and report on China's compliance with the 1981 U.N. declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief.  We further urge that when Sir Nigel Rodley, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, visits China later this year, he pay special attention to those whose mistreatment arose from their insistence on worshiping in accordance with their own consciences.   4. Coordination with other governments   We urge the Congress and Administration to coordinate with other governments on efforts to free Gendun Choekyi Nyima (the child recognized as Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama) and his family, from house arrest.   5. We also support ongoing contacts, official and unofficial, between and among various religious groups in China and their counterparts here. We favor dialogue and discussion with the Religious Affairs Bureau and other Chinese government officials charged with formulating or carrying out policy on religion.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet","Religious Freedom"

The legislation would address the problem of police brutality -- one of the most serious, enduring, and divisive human rights violations in the United States. The legislation would improve accountability systems within law enforcement agencies, enhance the Justice Department's ability to monitor police misconduct more consistently and conduct more """"pattern or practice"""" investigations nationally, require data collection regarding deaths in police custody, and create a system to respond to allegations of misconduct by immigration law enforcement officials. """"We commend Rep.

Police Reforms","","03/13/2000","In a letter sent to the U.S. Justice Department on March 8, Human Rights Watch's California Committee called on the agency's Civil Rights Division to insist on significant changes in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The Justice Department is now conducting a """"pattern or practice"""" inquiry. Under its civil powers, the Justice Department may demand reforms of any department exhibiting a """"pattern or practice"""" of police misconduct. """"The Rampart police scandal has exposed our city's dirty secret to the world,"""" said Mike Farrell, co-chair of the California Committee, """"While many wanted to believe that changes following the Christopher Commission's report had solved our problems, too many residents of Los Angeles knew better from painful experience. Our residents have waited long enough for suggested reforms to take hold - it is now time for the Justice Department to insist that they do."""" The letter is co-signed by a number of prominent Southern Californians, including leading religious, businesspeople, lawyers, health professionals and motion picture and television industry executives who support Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. The Committee urged the Justice Department to require that the LAPD and the city of Los Angeles: Create an independent commission to investigate all aspects of the operations of the anti-gang Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit. The commission should also review the Christopher Commission report, its follow-up reports, and the findings of the LAPD's internal Board of Inquiry report, made public on March 1. It should create a """"plan of action"""" to implement recommendations in those, and its own, reports. The commission should also investigate the reported improper cooperation between CRASH Rampart officers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and should assign responsibility for these violations, which may involve the FBI, senior INS officials, and the city government. Redefine the LAPD's anti-gang goals and strategies. Significant improvements in recruitment standards, training, and oversight must be made. The LAPD must also welcome community input regarding more effective and humane ways to combat gang violence. Create an independent civilian review board, tasked with receiving complaints, investigating complaints and determining whether they merit disciplinary action. The review board should have subpoena powers, be fully staffed and funded, and its disciplinary recommendations should be accepted and acted upon by LAPD officials absent compelling reasons not to do so. Create and utilize an effective """"early warning system."""" Support the creation of a special prosecutor's office for the County of Los Angeles. Reform officer-involved shooting (OIS) investigative procedures that allegedly allowed CRASH officers to cover-up unjustified shootings. The Inspector General's office should on the scene at OIS investigations and should be responsible for ensuring that proper investigative techniques are followed. Require full support and enhanced resources for the Inspector General's office. Provide confidentiality for """"whistle-blowers."""" The letter also requests that the Justice Department bring federal criminal civil rights charges against the subject officers under 18 USC §§ 241 and 242 if the District Attorney's office fails to pursue any case vigorously and thoroughly. March 7, 2000 Mr. Bill Lann Lee Acting Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Division Department of Justice 10th and Constitution Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20530 Dear Assistant Attorney General Lee: As the California Committee of Human Rights Watch, an organization deeply concerned about police abuse in the United States, we are writing to express our support for your """"pattern or practice"""" inquiry of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). It is our understanding that your office's Special Litigation Section, together with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, is now investigating a broad range of abuse allegations, including those involving the anti-gang Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit based at the Rampart Division. As Human Rights Watch described in its July 1998 report, Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States, we believe that your civil powers under the """"pattern or practice"""" statute are essential tools to improve police behavior and oversight. Because the LAPD has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to curtail abuses or hold brutal officers accountable, and because many incidents of police abuse involving LAPD officers have received national attention, it is imperative that your inquiry lead to significant and rapid improvements. Otherwise, we fear that future """"pattern or practice"""" investigations and negotiations could be severely undermined. Furthermore, as an organization monitoring human rights around the world, we know that the LAPD's conduct attracts intense attention abroad and, when its conduct fails to meet international human rights standards, exposes the United States to intense criticism from other countries and undermines U.S. efforts internationally to promote human rights. We strongly urge that you to consider the following recommendations as part of your reforms: Independent Commission: Require the creation of an independent commission to investigate all aspects of the operations of the anti-gang unit, with a specific focus on its personnel working out of the Rampart Division. Any investigation should not, however, be limited to this unit if evidence leads investigators elsewhere. The commission, which ideally must enjoy the full cooperation and support of city officials, the Los Angeles Police Commission, the LAPD, and the district attorney's office (a condition made more problematic by the City Council's recent decision against same), should investigate all allegations made by CRASH personnel regarding their own and other officers' misconduct, and should investigate all allegations made by residents of affected neighborhoods or other sources of information. The commission must examine the role of police supervisors who failed to identify abusive officers, district attorneys' office personnel who used tainted testimony and evidence provided by corrupt and brutal officers, and the police commission's failure to identify problems within the anti-gang unit. All those against whom there is evidence of misconduct or negligence must be held accountable. The commission should also review the Christopher Commission report, and its follow-up reports, to determine which recommendations still require action. It should also review the findings of the LAPD's internal board of inquiry report on the Rampart Division, made public on March 1, and should assist in a """"plan of action"""" to implement recommendations in that report. The commission should make concrete recommendations that the police department must implement within a set time-period. The commission should resemble the 1991 Christopher Commission in composition and in producing a public report on its findings. This commission must remain in place, in a smaller but functional form, until all of its policy recommendations are implemented. The commission should also investigate the reported improper cooperation between CRASH Rampart officers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). It has been alleged that approximately 160 persons were deported and another forty were criminally prosecuted for illegal re-entry following improper information-sharing between the INS and the Rampart CRASH unit during 1997 and 1998. INS agents allege that the Rampart CRASH unit violated a city ordinance, known as Special rule 40, which prohibits police from initiating actions to determine whether an individual is in the country illegally. Concerns have also been raised regarding INS agents' possible involvement in other misconduct by the Rampart CRASH unit. At this time, responsibility for these violations has not been determined, but it appears that the FBI, senior INS officials, and the city government may all have been involved in ordering or encouraging these activities. Reform anti-gang strategies: We are pleased to learn that Chief Parks has decided to abolish the CRASH unit as it now exists. Through its """"us vs. them"""" hostile attitude regarding city residents, brutal and corrupt tactics, and its supervisors' tolerance of a broad range of misconduct, the unit and its mission were irrevocably discredited. It is incumbent upon the LAPD, with guidance and instructions from your office, to re-think its anti-gang policies and tactics. Significant improvements regarding recruitment standards, training, and oversight must be made. The LAPD must also welcome community input regarding more effective and humane ways to combat gang violence. Civilian Review Board: Require the creation of an independent civilian review board tasked with receiving complaints, investigating complaints and determining whether they merit disciplinary action. The review board should have subpoena powers, be fully staffed and funded, and its disciplinary recommendations should be accepted and acted upon absent compelling reasons to the contrary. Create and utilize an effective """"early warning system"""": Order the police department to implement immediately a functional early warning tracking system that, among other purposes, identifies officers and their units against whom repeated citizen or internal complaints or civil lawsuits are filed. Trends in types of complaints must also be analyzed. Information from this tracking system, including the police department's actions to correct the problems identified, must be made available to the public while protecting privacy rights of police personnel. This type of system was recommended in the Christopher Commission report, but has not yet been implemented properly. Special Prosecutor's office: Require the creation of a special prosecutor's office for the County of Los Angeles. This office should be responsible for investigating allegations of corruption and brutality, and for prosecuting officers. The creation of such an office would overcome the problem arising from possible bias on the part of the district attorney's office in favor of officers with whom it typically works to prosecute civilians accused of crimes. It would remove a conflict of interest in cases in which officers are accused of lying, framing, or fabricating evidence to support a case prosecuted by the district attorney's office. It would also allow prosecutors to gain expertise in difficult cases involving police officers -- at present, prosecutions of police officers are so rare that prosecutorial experience is lacking. As an alternative, we urge you to consider the establishment of a statewide Special Prosecutor's Office to investigate allegations of police and prison corruption and brutality. Such an agency, while operating independently, could be based in the California Attorney General's office. Officer-involved shooting investigations: Demand the reform of officer-involved shooting investigative procedures that allegedly allowed CRASH officers to cover-up unjustified shootings. The Inspector General's office should always be present at the scene of investigations and should be responsible for ensuring that proper investigative techniques are followed (such as requiring that all witness statements are collected and preserved, that all forensic evidence is collected and preserved, that the shooting scene is not disturbed and that involved officers are separated and interviewed individually and promptly). Enhanced Inspector General's office: Require full support and enhanced resources for the Inspector General's office. The office should be provided with additional staff, especially investigators, so that it is able to initiate its own investigations. It should perform a community audit function -- victims or witnesses in CRASH abuse cases tried to file complaints with police personnel, but many then reportedly suffered reprisals from the officers about whom they wished to lodge a complaint. Others may have believed complaining about the CRASH officers would be futile, given the apparent impunity those officers enjoyed, or may have feared making a complaint because it might interfere with defending themselves against any criminal charges (whether legitimate or fabricated) they faced. In any event, the abusive behavior of these officers went unchecked, in part because victims were not able to file or pursue complaints. In addition to improving the intake procedures for making complaints (including by creating a civilian review board), the Inspector General's office should possess a community audit function. Its staff should make visits to communities throughout the city to determine how officers patrolling those neighborhoods are treating those they are sworn to serve. Community meetings with IG staff should also be held so that the IG is able to learn about emerging issues of concern. With enhanced staff, the IG should also test the complaint intake procedures used by the LAPD by trying to file complaints in various areas of the city. Whistle-blower protections: Provide confidentiality for """"whistle-blowers."""" Officers and others who come forward with information regarding police corruption and brutality must be protected against reprisals, especially during initial stages of an investigation into their allegations. Any officer who threatens or attempts to intimidate """"whistle-blowers"""" should be disciplined promptly. Criminal prosecutions of involved officers: We are pleased to learn that FBI agents are now working with the District Attorney's office and the police department to collect evidence and organize prosecutorial decisions. If the District Attorney's office fails to pursue any case vigorously and thoroughly, the Justice Department should bring federal criminal civil rights charges against the subject officers under 18 USC Secs. 241 and 242. We must note that our support for FBI involvement is attenuated by allegations of FBI involvement in improper cooperation between INS agents and Rampart CRASH officers. According to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, the former LAPD officer at the center of the Rampart scandal, Rafael Perez, reportedly told investigators about frequent unjustified beatings of suspects by police who then fabricated evidence to cover-up their illegal conduct. In describing a fellow officer's brutality, Perez said that the officer's """"biggest forte was thumping people. He just had this thing about beating people up while they were handcuffed. He was just a brutal guy....Just beat people up for no reason."""" This comment closely echoes ones made during a similar scandal involving brutality and drug-related corruption in the NYPD during the early 1990's. One officer testified, """"We'd just beat people in general"""" and then correctly concluded """"they [residents] hate the police. You'd hate the police too if you lived there."""" It is clear that until the apparent and recurrent problems in the LAPD's recruitment, training, supervision, and discipline are addressed, crime-fighting will suffer from community distrust. Your investigation must focus not only on the officers who engaged in corrupt and brutal acts, and supervisors who engaged in misconduct or who tolerated it -- it must also require changes in the management of the department, the Police Commission, and the District Attorney's office, all of which have been unable or unwilling to identify, monitor, and correct serious problems within the LAPD. We fully support your efforts to improve police practices and accountability in Los Angeles. Significant changes are clearly needed, and we urge the Justice Department to take this opportunity to help put them into effect, whether through a negotiated consent decree or an injunction.

Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, chair of the Council's Sanctions Committee on Angola, will present a report on the sanctions regime against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The 54-page report was put together by a ten-person independent Panel of Experts, mandated in May 1999 to investigate violations of the sanctions regime: the sale and delivery of arms and military equipment to the rebels; the provision of petroleum products to UNITA; the purchase of diamonds mined in areas controlled by UNITA; the maintenance of bank accounts and other financial assets of UNITA; the maintenance of UNITA offices abroad; and travel of senior UNITA officials and adult members of their immediate families. Human Rights Watch published a four-year study on sanctions-busting in Angola Unravels (in English, September 1999) and an updated edition, Angola Explicada (in Portuguese, December 1999). Both of these reports are available on the Human Rights Watch website at https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/angola/. Human Rights Watch welcomes Fowler's report. From 1993 until January 1999, despite the introduction of three packages of sanctions against UNITA, the U.N. largely turned a blind eye to their violation. Following the appointment of Robert Fowler as chair, the Sanctions Committee has become much more active, producing three reports with detailed recommendations. The Fowler report contains detailed new information, including that: * President Eyadema of Togo plays an important role in supporting UNITA;  * President Compaore of Burkina Faso features prominently too, allowing Burkina Faso to be an important location for diamond trading; * Rwanda is an important location for gun-running and diamond trading with UNITA. The government has full-knowledge of this and provides protection;  * Libreville, Gabon has been an important refueling location for sanctions-busting planes after they have been inside UNITA areas; * Most of the weapons imported by UNITA were from Bulgaria (see Human Rights Watch April 1999 report, Money Talks, on Sofia's exports of weapons to human rights abusers); * The """"extremely lax controls and regulations governing the Antwerp [diamond] market facilitate and perhaps even encourage illegal trading activity;"""" * The 1999 decision by De Beers to cease buying most Angolan rough """"has made it more difficult for UNITA to sell its diamonds thereby raising the costs to UNITA."""" (However, Human Rights Watch is concerned that an Israeli firm has filled the vacuum in February 2000 created by De Beers' decision); * UNITA has had a general aversion for banks and normal banking channels, although it has used some credit cards. (Human Rights Watch has heard from Angolan government sources that radio communications equipment was purchased by UNITA in the U.S. and paid for by a credit card linked to an account holder resident in the United Arab Emirates); * Air transport are the lifeline to UNITA. The panel published the names of a number of key figures in UNITA's transportation support network including Jacques """"Kiki"""" Lemaire, Victour Bout (Air Cess/Air Pass), and Johannes Parreira (Interstate Airways). Human Rights Watch has published more detailed information, including a list of planes noted by the U.N. to have visited UNITA areas in 1998. These include planes owned by the Angolan government (See Angola Explicada). The Fowler report makes thirty-nine recommendations, among which: * The Security Council should apply sanctions against leaders and governments found to have been deliberately breaking sanctions. These might be an embargo on arms sales for three years, followed by three years probation; * The end-user certificate system that prevails in many countries is wholly inadequate to ensure against diversion from their declared end-user. This system requires reform; * Compliance with U.N. sanctions regimes should be among the criteria considered by NATO and the European Union when evaluating candidates for new membership (aimed at Bulgaria especially); * DNA-type analysis should be conducted on fuel samples from petroleum industry suppliers in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region and that the results be used to create a database for the purpose of evaluating fuel obtained or captured from UNITA; * Forfeiture penalties should be introduced against those who can not provide the legal origin of rough diamonds; * Sanctions should be applied against individuals and enterprises discovered to be intentionally breaking U.N. sanctions relating to UNITA diamonds. Such traders or companies should also be put on an industry """"blacklist;"""" * A substantial bounty or """"finders' fee percentage"""" could be given to any institution, non-governmental organization, or individual that tracks down and identifies UNITA assets that are subject to sanction; * Offending countries should be declared sanctions breakers; candidacies of nationals from listed countries should not be supported for senior positions within the U.N. and international organizations should be discouraged from holding conferences and meetings in listed countries (a recommendation aimed at Togo, which is an incoming chair of the Organization of African Unity). The challenge is now to see the panel's imaginative recommendations enacted in practice. Human Rights Watch believes that a smaller panel of independent experts should be commissioned to monitor and encourage the implementation of the sanctions regimes against UNITA, and that Robert Fowler should be mandated to report back to the Security Council prior to the end of his mandate on January 1, 2001.","Africa, Angola","United Nations"

Rosemary Nelson was killed by a car bomb in Lurgan on 15 March 1999. Loyalist paramilitaries later claimed responsibility for her murder. She was killed following numerous death threats and after many appeals had been made to the authorities to protect her life. Her murder seriously undermined the rule of law in Northern Ireland since the UK government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) so tragically failed to protect her or to deal with the alleged intimidation of defence lawyers by RUC officers. The many questions in the wake of Rosemary Nelson's murder cannot be dealt with by the current criminal investigation because it is limited to the specific circumstances of the murder. We therefore urge the UK authorities to meet their obligations under international standards to carry out an independent, thorough and impartial inquiry into these questions. The inquiry should investigate Rosemary Nelson's complaints about RUC harassment and intimidation and how the authorities ultimately failed to protect her life. It is also vital to examine allegations of RUC harassment and intimidation of other lawyers through their clients in special interrogation centres.

Meeting in Geneva","03/10/2000","(New York)—Human Rights Watch today condemned the harsh prison sentence handed down in the case of Uighur businesswoman Rebiya Kadeer. The eight year sentence was issued by the Urumqi Intermediate Court in Xinjiang, China on March 10. The international monitoring organization called for Kadeer's immediate and unconditional release. """"This conviction and prison sentence are totally unjustified,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Just days before the opening of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, China is again carrying out summary trials— in this case for trying to meet a foreign delegation."""" The U.N. Commission convenes on March 20 in Geneva. """"Given the further deterioration over recent months, the U.N. should adopt a strong resolution ,"""" Jendrzejczyk added. On February 21, 2000 the Urumqi City Procuracy officially accused Ms. Kadeer of """"ignoring the law of the country and giving information to separatists outside the borders."""" Kadeer was detained on August 11, 1999, while on her way to meet with a U.S. Congressional staff delegation, whom she intended to give information about political prisoners in Xinjiang. She was convicted under Article 111 of the Chinese Criminal Law. According to Radio Free Asia, neither Kadeer nor her lawyer were allowed to speak at the trial.  Article 111 includes sentencing guidelines for anyone who provides state secrets or intelligence outside the country. The definition of state secrets in China is notoriously vague. Although there is nothing in the law that suggests that prisoner lists are state secrets, others who have made such lists public have received long sentences.  Ms. Kadeer's son, Ablikim Abyirim, and her secretary, Kahriman Abdukirim, were also detained in August and were adminsitratively sentenced to two-and three-year terms, respectively, on November 26, 1999. They are currently being held at the Walabai Reeducation Through Labor School. Human Rights Watch also called for their immediate release. Ms. Kadeer's husband, Sidik Rouzi, a former political prisoner, fled to the U.S.in 1996 and has commented on Uighur issues on Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America.  Jendrzejczyk also noted that the National People's Congress, currently meeting in Beijing, is discussing major new development plans for western China, including Xinjiang. Sentencing Kadeer, a former member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference until 1997, is only likely to increase concern about China's repressive treatment of the Uighur minority population.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Ale was accused of defamation of a public authority, under art. 6(b) State Security Law.  The Frei government has proposed to repeal the article but the bill has been stuck in Congress for almost a year. Human Rights Watch said that Ale's conviction violated his right to freedom of expression, and that the composition of the Supreme Court chamber that heard the case did not offer him guarantees of impartiality.

Police at the Syrdarya regional court took the reports from a Human Rights Watch representative who is monitoring the trial of twelve men charged with membership in Hizb-ut-Takhrir, a peaceful Muslim organization which is banned in Uzbekistan. Police confiscated six copies of the Uzbekistan chapter of the Human Rights Watch World Report, the international monitoring organization's annual global survey of human rights conditions. The World Report is a public document published by the organization in December 1999 and distributed widely around the world. The presiding judge at the trial, Sobir Tulkushev, characterized the distribution of the world report chapter as the """"the clandestine distribution of leaflets."""" He also warned the group to stop providing its materials to """"the relatives of criminals."""" On March 6, police threatened family members of the defendants not talk to the human rights group """"or else it will be worse for your sons."""" Court officials also announced that the police presence in and around the court had been stepped up because Human Rights Watch had distributed materials near the court house. """"This is harassment, pure and simple. Human Rights Watch is in Uzbekistan to monitor and report on human rights abuses; we operate openly and there is nothing clandestine about our publications or the way we work,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Uzbek officials know this perfectly well. The international community needs to remind them of their obligation to respect free expression."""" The confiscation of the organization's materials follow routine police harassment of Tashkent-based staff members. On February 28, 2000, Tashkent police summoned a Human Rights Watch staff member for interrogation, allegedly because they had detained a man who had one of the organization's business cards in his pocket.  Human Rights Watch established an office in Uzbekistan in 1996 and is registered with both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The Uzbek government's reputation with the international community has benefited from its perceived tolerance of the international rights group. Officials frequently point to the group's presence in the country as a evidence of civil society, even as authorities crack down heavily on local rights defenders.  Yet recently, the government of Uzbekistan has grown increasingly hostile to international human rights monitoring. Beginning in October 1999, Human Rights Watch was barred from monitoring ten separate trial hearings, despite the government's repeated declarations that trials would be open to the public. Throughout the summer, the government led a campaign of arrests and harassment against local rights defenders. In 1999, two members of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan, Ismoil Adylov and Mahbuba Kasymova, were convicted and sentenced to five-and-six-year prison terms on politically motivated and wholly spurious charges. Other rights defenders have been detained, beaten, harassed and subjected to intense surveillance by law enforcement officers.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Hundreds of thousands of civilians in southern Sudan face the cutoff of essential services, including food, because the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) refused to extend the deadline for negotiations with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The rebels set March 1, 2000 as the deadline for negotiating the Memorandum of Understanding and threatened the safety of relief agencies who did not evacuate by that date. As a result some eleven agencies handling about 75 percent of the humanitarian aid evacuated their staff and equipment on or before the deadline.  Human Rights Watch also criticized a rebel demand raised during negotiations that the aid agencies make their assets, such as vehicles and other equipment, available to the SPLA for its use. Such a provision would blur the line between civilian relief work and military activity and make aid agencies vulnerable to government attack, Human Rights Watch said.  """"The SPLA is behaving irresponsibly,"""" said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"It has imposed an artificial and unnecessary deadline that puts many, many civilian lives at risk.""""  Rone noted that a personal telephone call from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to SPLA Commander-in-Chief John Garang had evidently failed to persuade the SPLA to drop its artificial cutoff date.  Human Rights Watch said that if the SPLA wanted to expel agencies that provide essential services to the civilian population, it should have arranged a transition period so that other agencies could be brought in to cover civilian needs.  Rone noted that none of the donor governments, nor even the United Nations, intervened early enough nor forcefully enough to prevent the impasse. The SPLA rejected a European Union proposal put forward in January 2000. The United States government waited until mid-February to deploy its senior envoy to mediate with the SPLA and the agencies, and issued a statement """"deploring"""" the imminent expulsion only on February 28.  """"The SPLA claims to be the de facto government of the south, but it has not demonstrated any concern for the impact its deadline would have on the civilians in its jurisdiction,"""" said Rone. The negotiations over the Memorandum of Understanding the SPLA wanted the agencies to sign went on for more than one year. Although twenty-eight relief agencies signed before the deadline, some of them have said they did so under duress. The eleven who refused to sign are among the biggest relief and health care providers in southern Sudan, and have been there for more than a decade, including CARE International, World Vision, Save the Children-UK, Radda Barnen (Save the Children-Sweden), German Agro Action, Oxfam-UK, Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland, Global 2000, and others.  Rone raised the example of the Nuer people, who fled in all directions from the government's military onslaught because it wants access to the oil beneath their homeland. The aid agency World Vision has been supplying displaced Nuer people with aid in the (SPLA-controlled) Bahr El Ghazal region of southern Sudan. """"These Nuer cannot possibly return to their homes—it is too dangerous,"""" said Rone. """"They have lost all their cattle, their food and seeds, their clothes, and their cooking implements when the government displaced them. What are they supposed to do without international aid?"""" Human Rights Watch cautioned that it would not be easy for any new agencies to overcome the formidable logistical obstacles to operating in southern Sudan. During the famine in 1998, the effort to bring in sufficient aid took months.  """"To reinvent the supply networks is not something that can be done overnight,"""" said Rone. She also noted the danger that funds will be rerouted by donors to other emergencies.  Relief agencies withdrawing from southern Sudan have taken their vehicles and equipment with them, at the cost of millions of dollars. The SPLA cooperated for the most part with their orderly evacuation.  Rone noted that the Sudan government has frequently bombed hospitals and relief airstrips in southern Sudan, in violation of international law. She cautioned that the assets of relief agencies could become legitimate military targets if the SPLA were to take control of them.  """"The bright line between civilian and military activities has got to be maintained,"""" Rone said. """"Any agreement the SPLA eventually signs with aid agencies must make it clear that their assets are off limits to the SPLA for any purpose."""" Human Rights Watch condemned the Sudan government for bombing another civilian hospital in rebel territory a few days ago, killing two and injuring about a dozen civilians. Eleven of twelve bombs fell at the hospital, according to the NGO in charge, Samaritan's Purse, a U.S. aid organization. The hospital was in Lui, Equatoria, an area not currently on the front line.  Human Rights Watch noted that the SPLA expulsion of some agencies was compounded by the European Union decision to stop all aid to the southern sector of the United Nations umbrella relief group, Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). The European Union accounts for some 40 percent of the funding going to the OLS (southern sector). Some of this funding goes to rebel areas not controlled by the SPLA, such as the Nuer areas, which have been under attack by the government, causing massive displacement in all directions. Many displaced Nuer fled to other Nuer areas not controlled by the SPLA.  """"Why are these displaced Nuer being penalized by the E.U.? They are not in SPLA territory and have not been for almost a decade. They have lost everything when they were forced from their land. Why won't the E. U. continue to help them? It too is drawing arbitrary lines to the disadvantage of needy southerners,"""" Rone said.  Human Rights Watch urged the United States, the European Union, and other donors as well as the United Nations to take a more active role in the negotiations.","Africa, Sudan",""

Since the death of a fourteen-year-old girl at the state boot camp for girls last year, a growing number of youth and their parents have come forward with accounts of egregious human rights abuses in South Dakota's juvenile detention facilities. These accounts charge that guards shackle youth in spread-eagled fashion after cutting their clothes off (a practice known as """"four-pointing""""), chain youth inside their cells (""""bumpering""""), and place children in isolation twenty-three hours a day for extended periods of time. Girls held in the State Training School report that they have been strip-searched by male guards, sprayed with pepper spray while naked, and handcuffed spread-eagled to their beds. """"These reports are shocking,"""" said Bochenek. """"It's appalling to think of guards cutting the clothes off of children, shackling them naked to their beds, or chaining them to their doors. Americans criticize other societies that treat children in this way. They should not allow these kinds of practices to take place in their own country."""" Many of the children in these facilities have been detained for minor offenses such as shoplifting. Others are locked up for """"status offenses,"""" meaning acts such as truancy or running away from home that would not be crimes if committed by an adult. The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, enacted in 1974, requires states to remove all status offenders from juvenile detention and correctional facilities. South Dakota is one of only three states that do not comply with this federal mandate. Ten days ago the Youth Law Center, based in San Francisco, and Washington, DC, filed a class-action lawsuit against the South Dakota Department of Corrections. In addition to charging the department with abusive disciplinary practices and excessive use of force, the suit alleges that detained youth are subjected to inadequate medical and mental health care, deficient education, and other abusive conditions of confinement. Reports of abuses in South Dakota's juvenile detention facilities became an issue in July 1999, when Gina Score died after collapsing during a forced run at the state's boot camp for girls. According to the state investigators' report, she frothed at the mouth after she collapsed, lost control of her bladder, progressively lost her ability to communicate, and eventually became completely unresponsive. Boot camp staff refused to allow other youth to shield her from the sun, telling them that they should not make things """"easy"""" or """"comfortable"""" for her. Staff left her where she fell for over three hours. When they finally took her to the hospital, her body temperature measured 108 degrees, the highest temperature the thermometer could record. Doctors pronounced her dead an hour later. Human Rights Watch called on Governor Janklow to end the use of """"four-pointing"""" and """"bumpering,"""" prohibit the use of solitary confinement, and end routine strip-searches of girls by male guards. Following international standards, physical restraint and the use of force should only be used after all other control methods have been exhausted and failed. Methods of restraint should never cause humiliation or degradation. Children should never be subjected to closed or solitary confinement or any other punishment that may compromise their physical or mental health. """"Children should not have to go to federal court to get the state to respect their rights,"""" said Bochenek. """"The state can and should implement these changes now."""" The organization also called on the governor to change juvenile sentencing guidelines that permit status offenders to be locked up and allow for open-ended sentences that can result in youth remaining in detention until they reach the age of twenty-one.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Juvenile rights groups, parents of youth in detention, and the children themselves have charged that guards shackle youth in spread-eagled fashion after cutting their clothes off (a practice known as """"four-pointing""""), chain youth inside their cells (""""bumpering""""), and place children in isolation twenty-three hours a day for extended periods of time. Girls held in the State Training School report that they have been strip-searched by male guards, sprayed with pepper spray while naked, and handcuffed spread-eagled to their beds. In all facilities, children also report that they are forced to endure grossly inadequate mental health care, glaring deficiencies in education, and other substandard conditions of confinement. As you know, reports of abuses in South Dakota's juvenile facilities are nothing new. In July 1999, Gina Score, a fourteen-year-old, collapsed during a forced run at the state's boot camp for girls. According to the state investigators' report, she frothed at the mouth after she collapsed, lost control of her bladder, progressively lost her ability to communicate, and eventually became completely unresponsive. The staff at the boot camp refused to allow other detainees to form a human shield for her, reportedly commenting that they should not make things """"easy"""" or """"comfortable"""" for her. She remained near where she fell for three and a quarter hours before the staff transported her to a hospital. Her body temperature upon admission was at least 108 degrees, the limit of the thermometer's ability to measure. She never revived; doctors pronounced her dead an hour after she was admitted. After her death, other youth and parents came forward with additional accounts of abuses at all state juvenile detention facilities. At least two lawsuits have been brought against the state, including a class-action suit filed February 24, 2000 by the Youth Law Center. Children should not have to bring a federal lawsuit to ensure that the state respects their fundamental rights. We urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that policies and practices in all state juvenile facilities comply with state, federal, and international law. At a minimum, these steps should include the following: End the use of """"four-pointing,"""" """"bumpering,"""" and similar practices. Physical restraint and the use of force should only be used after all other control methods have been exhausted and failed. Methods of restraint should never cause humiliation or degradation. They should be used restrictively and only for the shortest possible period of time. """"Four-pointing"""" and """"bumpering"""" fail to comply with every one of these principles and amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, in violation of international law. Prohibit the use of solitary confinement. International standards forbid the use of closed or solitary confinement or any other punishment that may compromise a child's physical or mental health. As with """"four-pointing"""" and """"bumpering,"""" the placement of children in twenty-three hour solitary confinement for days or weeks at a time is a flagrant violation of international law. End routine strip-searches and other forcible disrobing of girls by male guards. Routinely permitting male guards to strip-search girls violates their right to bodily privacy. This practice is especially alarming in light of a November 1999 Argus Leader report that between 75 and 90 percent of girls in the State Training School have been sexually abused in the past. As the Argus Leader noted, girls who have been the victims of sexual abuse may relive their abuse when male guards force them to disrobe and subject them to intrusive bodily searches. Detention center policies and practices should strictly limit strip-searches, pat frisks, and visual observation by members of the opposite sex to emergency situations. Abolish indeterminate sentencing of youth. International standards provide that children should be deprived of their liberty only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. In addition, a juvenile disposition must always be proportionate to the gravity of the offense, the circumstances of the child, and the needs of the community. Indeterminate sentencing violates these principles and flouts basic standards of due process and fundamental fairness. End the practice of locking up status offenders. According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, South Dakota is one of only three states that do not comply with federal legislation mandating the deinstitutionalization of status offenders. The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, enacted in 1974, requires states to remove all status offenders from juvenile detention and correctional facilities. The serious charges brought by South Dakota's detained youth amount to a stunning indictment of the state's juvenile detention system. At the very least, they are a clarion call for a thorough review of existing policies and practices at all state juvenile detention facilities. We strongly urge you to conduct such a review and take immediate steps to protect the safety of youth in state custody.

The international rights organization, which took part the Pinochet case and recently spearheaded the case leading to the indictment and house arrest of the former Chadian dictator Hissein Habre in Senegal, today published a 22-page guide: """"The Pinochet Precedent: How Victims Can Pursue Human Rights Criminals Abroad."""" The guide explains the laws and procedures that victims can use to bring their tormentors to justice in other countries.     """"Since Pinochet's arrest, we have been in contact with victims' organizations, exploring avenues to bring other leading human rights criminals to justice,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Habre case was our first success, but there are a lot of other torturers out there.""""     Human Rights Watch pointed out that under the international law principle of """"universal jurisdiction,"""" the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes can be prosecuted in any country. The United Nations Convention against Torture, ratified by 118 countries, requires states to prosecute or extradite torturers who enter their territory.     The group said the decision on February 3 by a Senegalese judge to indict Habre on torture charges showed that a sea change is underway in how the world deals with the worst abuses. For the first time outside of Europe, an official has been indicted for atrocities by the courts of another country.     """"The Pinochet case reaffirmed the principles that a country can judge the crime of torture no matter where the acts were committed, and that not even a former head of state has immunity from prosecution,"""" said Brody. """"But it also showed us that there are countries like England and Spain where these lofty principles can actually be applied in practice. By arresting Habre, Senegal demonstrated that African countries can also do the right thing.""""     Brody noted that Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have all initiated or completed prosecutions of persons allegedly involved in abuses in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In addition, in July 1999, French police arrested a Mauritanian colonel, Ely Ould Dah, who was studying at a French military school, on the basis of the U.N.Convention against Torture, when two Mauritanian exiles came forward and identified him as their torturer.     The group noted that the defendant does not have to be in the prosecuting state when the case is begun, depending on the particular laws of each country and the possibility of an eventual extradition. """"Remember that Pinochet was at home in Chile when the prosecution against him was initiated in Spain,"""" said Brody.     The organization also called on all states to adopt """"implementing legislation,"""" or laws directly providing their courts with jurisdiction over human rights outrages, no matter where they were committed. """"There should be no safe haven for people who commit atrocities,"""" said Brody. Many states that have ratified international treaties requiring them to prosecute alleged torturers or war criminals have not incorporated these requirements into national law. Despite the principles of international law, few states have actually given their courts jurisdiction to hear cases of crimes against humanity or genocide committed abroad.     Other states, even with the proper legislation, have lacked the political will to capture mass murderers. In August 1999, Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, a top aide to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was allowed to leave Austria despite a criminal complaint citing his active role in Iraq's genocide against the Kurds.     When former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who has lived in Zimbabwe since 1991, visited South Africa in November 1999 for medical treatment, the authorities failed to respond to calls for his arrest or extradition.     Among other human rights criminals now in exile, the group cited Uganda's Idi Amin currently living in Saudi Arabia, Milton Obote, also of Uganda, whois now in Zambia, Haiti's Raul Cedras and Philippe Biamby in Panama, Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner in Brazil and Haitian death squad leader Emmanuel """"Toto"""" Constant, who lives in New York City.     """"Pinochet was the first former head of state to be arrested by another country for human rights crimes. Habre has now become the second,"""" said Brody.

A sampling of witness testimony is attached.   Most of the victims were civilians living in camps for internally displaced people, who were attacked when they ventured out to get food, wood and/or water. Several of the attacks occurred less than one kilometer from checkpoints manned by ECOMOG [the West African peacekeeping force], Sierra Leonean Army soldiers, and/or UNAMSIL peacekeepers.   """"These atrocities are taking place practically under the noses of government and international troops,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Innocent civilians are suffering, and it's the responsibility of these troops to protect them. They should do their job.""""   Victims told Human Rights Watch that most of the perpetrators had identified themselves as members of the ex-Sierra Leonean Army. Some witnesses and victims were told the rebel units also included members of the rebel Revolutionary United Front.   Human Rights Watch interviewed several abductees who were either released or escaped. They said that female abductees were usually raped, and the male captives were primarily used as slave labor to carry looted items, or remove and carry zinc roofing material from abandoned villages. This roofing was later taken to a main Freetown highway and, according to witnesses, sold by the rebels to soldiers of the loyal Sierra Leonean Army and ECOMOG who were aware of and spoke with the abducted civilians.   All of the abductees interviewed said the rebels have established bases in the towns of Gbere-bana, Rofurawa, Mogboni, and Mabingbera, all within the Port Loko District.   Sierra Leonean authorities acknowledge the presence of some 1000 rebels within the Port Loko area. However, since the July 1999 signing of the Lome Peace Accord, neither government, ECOMOG, nor UNAMSIL forces have been willing to actively pursue the rebels or intervene to protect the civilian population.   """"Everyone is afraid of undermining the disarmament process that was laid out in the Lome agreement,"""" said Takirambudde. """"But what good is the peace agreement if many civilians are living as though the war had never ended?""""   Witnesses and victims frequently quoted their captors as saying that they were unwilling to participate in the disarmament process until after the elections planned for spring 2001.   Human Rights Watch urged the Sierra Leonean Police, Army, ECOMOG, and UNAMSIL to be more aggressive in protecting civilian and displaced populations who continue to be terrorized by rebel units.   While local authorities bear the primary responsibility for keeping the peace, Human Rights Watch said, the mandate of UNAMSIL was expanded under a February 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council to include the protection of civilians. These """"Chapter VII"""" responsibilities include: """"to coordinate with and assist, in common areas of deployment, the Sierra Leonean law enforcement authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities."""" (10.d) and """"... within its capabilities and areas of deployment, to afford protection to civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, taking into account the responsibilities of the Government of Sierra Leone."""" (10.e)   Primary responsibility for the internally displaced lies with the Sierra Leonean authorities. However, where governments are unable or unwilling to protect human rights, the international community is legally entitled, if not obliged, to become involved. In accepting that human rights is part of the UNAMSIL mandate, the U.N. must put into place tangible operating procedures to create a safer environment for Sierra Leone's internally displaced.   Human Rights Watch said the success of the Lome Peace Accord should be measured not only in terms of how many combatants participate in the """"disarmament, demobilization and reintegration"""" process, but also how human rights protection and the rule of law are established.   The government of Sierra Leone and rebels signed a peace agreement on July 7, 1999 in Lome, Togo which commits the rebels to lay down their arms in exchange for representation in a new government. The agreement also included a controversial general amnesty for all crimes committed during the war.   The implementation of the agreement has been marred by serious delays in deployment of the UN peacekeepers, slow progress within the disarmament program and the implementation of most other areas of the accord. Nearly half the country remains under the control of rebel forces.   Testimonies from Sierra Leonean Victims of Rebel Abuses   Fatmata, 11, who lives in a displaced persons camp near Port Loko, was one of three children abducted on January 25 when they'd gone in search of food and wood. Both she and her 12-year-old friend Kadi were raped by the rebels. She described her abduction which lasted for nearly three weeks:  We went to find wood and potato leaves in a village called Mathiaka... one of the men grabbed me, I got away but then more of them came and surrounded us. They beat me, hit me hard on the back of the neck with a gun and then later gave me a bushel of rice to carry to their camp in Rofurawa. The one who caught made me pound rice and wash his clothes and he was the one who had sex with me. I begged him to let me go to my people but he said """"I'm going to have sex with you until they disarm us."""" I wanted so much to escape but I didn't know the bush around that place and he kept saying he'd kill me if I ever tried to get away. Some days I complained to his wife. She was so nice... she sympathized and said she too had been abducted. I was with them for twenty days. I was bleeding so much and still feel so weak. I'm only 11 years old... I haven't even seen my period yet.  Haja, seventeen, was one of ten young women taken off a bus after being ambushed near Rogberi by rebel soldiers on Jan 17. She described how all ten were abducted and later raped:  I was on my way up-country to attend my father's funeral when at around 10:30 am a group of about 40 rebels with RPG's [rocket-propelled grenades], guns and machetes stopped us and forced the driver to go off the road until we reached an abandoned village. He ordered us to come down and walk single file inside a house. We were so frightened and some were crying, so he said, """"Why are you crying? Are you bereaved? Because now we're going to cut your throats so you'll really have something to cry over."""" The rebels searched us and separated all the young girls from the rest of the group. Then they walked the ten of us to another abandoned village where they made us sit and started calling us into a house one by one. The first one was a girl named Isatu. We saw five of them go in and heard her crying. I was the third to be called. They told me to lie down on a dirty brown cloth. I said I don't know man business. I started bleeding after the first one and screamed that I was going to die. I pleaded with them but they told me to shut up and that they'd do whatever they wanted with me. Four of them used me that day. I just prayed, """"Father save me from these people and return me safely to my home.""""  Abu, an elder from the village Lalbanka, was one of seven people abducted by the rebels on February 14 and forced to carry zinc roofing panels stripped from abandoned villages. An elderly woman, also abducted from his village, was severely beaten and later shot because she was unable to carry the load. Abu described what happened:  At 3:00 pm I'd gone into the field to use the toilet and on my way back they surrounded me. They led me at gunpoint and I saw that six more people from the nearby villages of Lalsoso and Yingesa had also been caught. First they forced us to take zinc panels off the houses and then they gave us bundles of 20 to carry. My neighbor, Hawa, tried walking with that big bundle but she couldn't and dropped it along the way. Then they took away some of the load and told her to walk but some time later she just collapsed from exhaustion. Two of them started beating her with sticks. They made us stand around and watch. They ordered her to dance and to kiss them. She tried but blood was streaming out of her head. I am a village elder and she came over and grabbed onto my pants and said """"They're killing me... help me."""" I said she was my daughter-in-law and begged them to stop but they said they would kill me too. We left her there - unconscious and bleeding - with one rebel. Later that night that rebel, who called himself """"Junior,"""" boasted that he had killed her and told us that that is what happens to the ones who don't work. She was the mother of six and grandma of seven. I still had her blood from where she held onto my pants.  According to testimonies by other abductees, her decomposing body was later shown to them as an example of why they should not run away or defy the orders of the rebels.   Hassan, thirty-five, described how his daughter was abducted in a raid on Mabenkia Village on January 10, and how his brother was killed a few weeks later when they ventured back to see if the village was safe.  At around 5:00 pm I was with my children when about 60 of them in full uniform and with guns and RPG's surprised us. We all ran into the bushes and from where I was hiding I saw my sixteen-year-old daughter being dragged away by those people and heard them shouting about President Tejan Kabbah not having given them what they wanted. We fled to a displaced camp near Freetown with the rest of my family but because we didn't have enough to eat, my brothers, cousins and I decided to venture back to try to salvage some of what we'd planted and to see if it was safe to return. We went by canoe but were unfortunately caught from behind - the rebels had another canoe and they held us under gun point until we reached the shore. As we were arriving, one rebel shot my twenty-year-old brother Mani. He fell, wounded into the shallow water and as we jumped down to try to rescue him, the rebel yelled """"Don't touch him. Get up - I'm going to finish you."""" And then he shot him at close range. Then another rebel came and grabbed my ten-year-old cousin who stated screaming """"Don't let him kill me,"""" but the rebel told us he wanted the boy. Then they ordered us to leave and said, """"That body is going to rot here and if you ever came back to try and bury him, we'll kill you all."""" Now we're displaced people with no fishing nets or boats. All I want is to see my daughter and to go back to our village. What kind of ceasefire, what kind of peace is this?  Twelve-year-old Osman, who lives in an internally-displaced-persons (IDP) camp near Port Loko, was abducted at the end of January in Mathakan village, when he and his sister ventured out to pick cassava. Before being able to escape, five days later he was given military training by rebels who identified themselves as being both ex-SLA and RUF. He described the training:  While in Furawa camp, which they call """"combat camp,"""" they took five of us for military training. We were all given war names; I was called """"Ceasefire,"""" and the other boys who were all about my age were called """"Stop the War,"""" """"Gunshot,"""" """"Lay Ambush,"""" and """"Roughneck."""" The commander gathered us for training in the early morning every morning, and taught us how to load, cock, clean and shoot an AK-47. I even fired it in the air one day. They taught us how to salute, stand at attention and said, """"Don't worry about going home to your people... We'll provide for your education."""" They said they were training us so we'll be part of the rebel force, and that they weren't leaving the rebel life until after the elections. I didn't like the idea of war, of all this. I just wanted to go home to my people.  Vandi, was one of fourteen men abducted from a coal pit in Lalsoso on February 20. He was used as slave labor for six days and forced to work long hours removing zinc panels off the roofs of houses in abandoned villages. He described how the panels were then sold to individual soldiers from both ECOMOG and the loyal Sierra Leonean Army. He had whip marks in at least five places on his neck, arms and face where he said he'd been beaten by the rebels.  We went village to village unroofing the houses. The rebels would sit down and watch us as we worked and then force us to walk long hours; sometimes throughout the night, with 25 zinc panels on our heads. Sometimes I could barely move and they would beat me with a whip or the blunt end of the machete. Their base was Gberi-bana. An hour before reaching the main road, where they sold the panels for 1,000 leones (US$0.80) per sheet, the rebels stashed their guns and took off their uniforms. When we arrived at a village called Sumbuya, which was about a kilometer from the main highway, they told us to sit, and put two or three of them to guard us. Then we'd wait until the SLA soldiers and ECOMOG soldiers, who you could tell by the marks on their faces and the way they talk, to come to buy from the rebels. A few times the SLA's and ECOMOG's came to talk with us; once they asked me what had happened to my arm and neck and I told them I'd been abducted and beaten. One of the other abductees, who was from my village, even knew one of the loyal SLA's and he pleaded with him to convince the rebels to release us. The loyal SLA said he was sorry and on our way back into the bush one of the rebels beat my friend and said they'd never take him to the highway again.","Africa, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, International Justice, Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Women's Rights, Internally Displaced People, Sexual Violence and Rape, Children and Armed Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/03/02/pinochet-case-milestone","Pinochet Case a Milestone","Pinochet Case a Milestone","Chile Urged to Prosecute Ex-Dictator","03/02/2000","(New York) - Human Rights Watch said today that the arrest of Augusto Pinochet represented a permanent advance in the cause of human rights, despite the decision by British Home Secretary Jack Straw to allow him to return to Chile. The group also called on the Chilean parliament to block a proposed constitutional reform that would give permanent immunity from prosecution to all former heads of state. """"It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of victims that he will not face trial in Spain,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"But the very fact that he was arrested, and that his claim of immunity was rejected, has already changed the calculus of dictators around the world. The Pinochet case signified the beginning of the end of their impunity."""" Human Rights Watch noted that the """"Pinochet Precedent"""" was already taking root in other countries. It praised the decision on February 3 by a Senegalese judge to indict the former Chadian dictator Hissein Habre on torture charges. """"A sea change is underway in how the world deals with the worst abuses,"""" said Brody. The Pinochet case reaffirmed the principle that human rights atrocities are subject to """"universal jurisdiction"""" and can be prosecuted anywhere in the world. Two rulings by the House of Lords found that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution even though he was head of state at the time the crimes were committed. Human Rights Watch also called attention to a proposed constitutional reform in Chile that would give permanent immunity to all former heads of state. The Chilean parliament is expected to pass the new measure by the end of March. """"This law would set a terrible precedent,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Not only would it make it harder to bring Pinochet to justice, it would weaken the institution of democracy in Chile."""" Gen. Pinochet arranged """"senator-for-life"""" status for himself when he left power in 1990, thereby ensuring his immunity from prosecution. But since the former dictator was arrested in London, the Chilean judiciary has proved more willing to consider lawsuits against him. If Pinochet were not exempted from prosecution on the grounds of ill health on his return, Chilean lawyers and human rights activists had hoped to sue for the outright revocation of his immunity. The proposed reform would vastly complicate that undertaking. Chile's new law would give its public officials the most extensive immunity on the continent. On January 19, with the country in the midst of its annual summer holidays, President Eduardo Frei gave the proposal """"high urgency"""" status, and the Chamber of Deputies approved it without modification on January 25. The bill must be approved by both chambers of parliament, meeting in plenary, within sixty days. It could therefore become law in the last week of March.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/29/war-crimes-chechnya-and-response-west","War Crimes In Chechnya and the Response of the West","War Crimes In Chechnya and the Response of the West","Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations","02/29/2000","The evidence we have gathered in Chechnya is disturbing: Russian forces have committed grave abuses, including war crimes, in their campaign in Chechnya. In Grozny, the graffiti on the walls reads """"Welcome to Hell: Part Two,"""" about as good a summary as any of what Chechen civilians have been living through in the past five months.  It is a pleasure to be here today, and I appreciate the attention the committee is devoting to the deepening crisis in Chechnya. My name is Peter Bouckaert, and I am the Emergencies Researcher at Human Rights Watch. I have just returned from three months in Ingushetia, the Republic neighboring Chechnya, where I have been documenting war crimes and other abuses committed in the Chechnya conflict. Human Rights Watch researchers have had a permanent research presence in Ingushetia since the beginning of November, and we have conducted detailed interviews with more than 500 witnesses to violations in Chechnya. Because of our permanent presence in the region, we are able to corroborate eyewitness accounts through independent and consistent testimonies. Our research findings on Chechnya are publicly available in the form of some forty press releases and two reports, and provide detailed information about the abuses summarized in my testimony. The press releases and short reports are available on our website, www.hrw.org, and I have brought copies with me today. The evidence we have gathered in Chechnya is disturbing: Russian forces have committed grave abuses, including war crimes, in their campaign in Chechnya. In Grozny, the graffiti on the walls reads """"Welcome to Hell: Part Two,"""" about as good a summary as any of what Chechen civilians have been living through in the past five months. Russia talks about fighting a war against terrorism in Chechnya, but it is Chechen civilians who have borne the brunt of the Russian offensive in this war, as in the first Chechen conflict. Most abuses we have documented have been committed by Russian forces; we have also documented serious abuses by Chechen fighters. Atrocities in Chechnya Since the beginning of the conflict, Russian forces have indiscriminately and disproportionately bombed and shelled civilian objects, causing heavy civilian casualties. The Russian forces have ignored their Geneva convention obligations to focus their attacks on combatants, and appear to take few safeguards to protect civilians: It is this carpet-bombing campaign which has been responsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths in the conflict in Chechnya. The Russian forces have used powerful surface-to surface rockets on numerous occasions, causing death tolls in the hundreds in the Central Market bombing in Grozny and in many smaller towns and villages. Lately, Russian commanders have threatened to use even more powerful explosives, including fuel air explosives which could have a disastrous casualty count if used against civilian targets. The bombing campaign has turned many parts of Chechnya to a wasteland: even the most experienced war reporters I have spoken to told me they have never seen anything in their careers like the destruction of the capital Grozny. Russian forces have often refused to create safe corridors to allow civilians to leave areas of active fighting, trapping civilians behind front lines for months. The haggard men and women who came out of Grozny after a perilous journey told me of living for months in dark, cold cellars with no water, gas or electricity and limited food: their little children were often in shock, whimpering in the corners of their tents in Ingushetia and screaming in fright whenever Russian war planes flew over, reminding them of the terror in Grozny. Men especially face grave difficulties when attempting to flee areas of fighting: they are subjected to verbal taunting, extortion, theft, beatings, and arbitrary arrest. On several occasions, refugee convoys have come under intense bombardment by Russian forces, causing heavy casualties. Currently, tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the Argun river gorge in Southern Chechnya, stuck behind Russian lines without a way out from the constant bombardment and rapidly running out of food supplies. For many Chechens, the constant bombardment was only the beginning of the horror. Once they came into contact with Russian forces, they faced even greater dangers. Human Rights Watch has now documented three large-scale massacres by Russian forces in Chechnya. In December, Russian troops killed seventeen civilians in the village of Alkhan-Yurt while going on a looting spree, burning many of the remaining homes and raping several women. We have documented at least fifty murders, mostly of older men and women, by Russian soldiers in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny since Russian forces took control of that district: innocent civilians shot to death in their homes and their yards. In one case, three generations of the Zubayev family were shot to death in the yard of their home. On February 5, a few days after Secretary of State Albright met with President Putin in Moscow, Russian forces went on a killing spree in the Aldi district of Grozny, shooting at least sixty-two and possibly many more civilians who were waiting in the street and their yards for soldiers to check their documents. These were entirely preventable deaths, not unavoidable casualties of war. They were acts of murder, plain and simple. Refugees are returning to Grozny to find their relatives or neighbors shot to death in their homes. And most disturbing of all, there is no evidence that the killing spree has stopped. In the past month, the Russian authorities have begun arresting large numbers of civilian men throughout Chechnya. These men, numbering well over a thousand, and some women, have been taken to undisclosed detention facilities, and their relatives are desperately trying to locate them. I have spoken to men who have been able to pay their way out of these detention facilities, and they have given me consistent testimony about constant beatings, severe torture, and even cases of rape of both men and women. One of the men suffered from a back injury after being hit with a heavy metal hammer; a second man had several broken ribs and suffered from kidney problems from the severe beatings. The Refugee Crisis The constant attacks by Russian forces against the civilian population have caused more than two hundred thousand Chechens to flee into neighboring Ingushetia, overwhelming the local population, which numbers only some 300,000. Many more internally displaced persons are trapped inside Chechnya, especially in the southern Argun river gorge, unable to seek safety because of the refusal of Russian forces to create safe corridors. The conditions in the refugee camps are dire, with inadequate shelter, food, clean water, heating, and other essentials. Only a minority of refugees are housed in crowded tent camps or railway cars: the majority live in makeshift shelter in abandoned farms, empty trucking containers, or similar substandard shelter; many are forced to pay large sums for private housing. Because refugees are forced to rely on their own limited resources for survival, they are often forced to return to what is still a very active war zone when they run out of money, putting their lives at renewed risk. Russia is not allowing humanitarian organizations to operate freely in Ingushetia, and is virtually blocking any direct assistance to needy persons inside Chechnya. Refugee children in Ingushetia are not attending school, and medical needs often go unmet. The contrast with the international response to last year's Kosovo crisis is striking, although the security concerns and Russian obstruction are certainly relevant factors. Russian authorities have repeatedly attempted to force refugees to return to Chechnya by denying them food in the camps or by rolling their train compartments back to Chechnya. Russia is attempting to relocate refugee populations to areas of northern Chechnya under Russian control, which would place them beyond the reach of international humanitarian agencies and under more direct Russian control. The border between Chechnya and Ingushetia is regularly closed, preventing refugees from fleeing to safety and often splitting up families stranded on different sides of the border. Following the destruction of the capital, Grozny, and many other towns and villages in Chechnya, and the widespread looting and burning of homes, many refugees simply no longer have a home to return to: everything they owned in this world has been destroyed. Abuses by Chechen Fighters As in all conflicts where we work, Human Rights Watch documents violations by all sides to the conflict in Chechnya. We have uncovered evidence of serious abuses by the Chechen fighters in the conflict. Chechen fighters, particularly those among them who consider themselves Islamic fighters, have shown little regard for the safety of the civilian population, often placing their military positions in densely populated areas and refusing to leave civilian areas even when asked to do so by the local population. Village elders who tried to stop Chechen fighters from entering their villages have been shot, or severely beaten, on several occasions. In short, the Chechen fighters have added to the civilian casualty count in Chechnya by not taking the necessary precautions to protect civilian lives. Some Chechen fighters were also responsible for brutal abuses in the interwar years, including widespread kidnappings and hostage taking, and there is convincing evidence that Chechen fighters have executed captured Russian soldiers in this conflict. Without minimizing the seriousness of abuses carried out by Chechen fighters, it is important to state that the primary reason for civilian suffering in Chechnya today is abuses committed against the civilian population by Russian forces. Also, Chechen fighters, in particular the Islamic fighters, are deeply disliked by the civilian population, who see them as responsible for bringing renewed war to Chechnya. The vast majority of Chechens feel trapped between Chechen fighters who have imposed this war on them, and the Russian forces who continuously and often brutally attack them. Russia's Failure to Stop Abuses One of the most troubling aspects of the war is that the Russian authorities have failed to act to stop abuses perpetrated by their troops in Chechnya. There is simply no indication that the Russian authorities have taken any steps to prevent these abuses, to investigate them when they do happen, and to punish those responsible. As a result, a climate of impunity is rapidly growing in Chechnya: Russian soldiers know that they can treat Chechen civilians however they like, and will not face any consequences. Nowhere is the failure of the military authorities to stop abuses in Chechnya more obvious than in the widespread looting which has taken place in Chechnya since the beginning of the war. Soldiers are systematically looting civilian homes, carting away the stolen goods on their military trucks, and storing them at their barracks in plain daylight. The looting is visible to everyone, and is occurring right under the noses of their commanders. Yet nothing is being done to stop this and other abuses. The absolute failure of the Russian military command to stop war crimes, particularly summary executions, in Chechnya makes them highly complicit. Instead of acting to prevent abuses, the Russian military has continued to issue blanket denials about abuses. In the face of the overwhelming mountain of evidence about abuses in Chechnya, these blanket denials are unacceptable. The Response from the West Equally worrying is the lack of a strong Western response to the abuses in Chechnya. Instead of using its relationship with Russia to bring an end to the abuses in Chechnya, the Clinton administration has focused on cementing its relationship with Acting President Putin, the prime architect of the abusive campaign in Chechnya. Secretary of State Madeline Albright traveled to Moscow while bombs were raining down on Grozny, and chose to focus her remarks on Acting President Putin's qualities as the new leader of Russia, rather than on the brutal war in Chechnya. U.S. officials continue to understate the level of atrocities in Chechnya, talking about """"abuses"""" in the war rather than calling those abuses by their proper name, war crimes. The administration is understating the amount of influence and power it has over Moscow, because the administration wants to continue with business as usual, and mend its ties with Moscow in the wake of the NATO bombing campaign in the former Yugoslavia. To date, the international community has given the Russian government no reason to fear any repercussions for its actions in Chechnya. The United States and its Western allies could be doing a lot more to stop the brutal abuses in Chechnya. Starting tomorrow at the trilateral EU-US-Russia meeting in Lisbon, they must call the abuses in Chechnya by their proper name, war crimes, and must insist that there will be no """"business as usual"""" with Russia while these violations continue. The West must insist on accountability for the crimes committed in Chechnya, and an end to the rapidly growing climate of impunity rapidly developing in Chechnya. An immediate international monitoring presence should be established to document war crimes and other abuses in Chechnya, and to provide the international community with accurate and reliable information about abuses in the Chechen conflict. The U.S. should push the World Bank and the IMF to explicitly suspend pending loan payments until the Russian Federation takes steps to reign in its troops, begins a meaningful process of accountability for abuses, and fully cooperates with the deployment of an international monitoring presence in the north Caucasus. The IMF and the World Bank should not be financing a government bent on a policy that is so destructive and contrary to their institutional mandates as the Russian military operation in Chechnya. The U.S. should encourage its European allies to bring a case to the European Court of Human Rights, charging Russia with the blatant violations of its international treaty obligations in the conduct of the Chechen war. The conduct of the Chechen war and the creation of a Commission of Inquiry should be a prominent item for discussion at the upcoming U.N. Commission on Human Rights meeting, and the U.S. must insist on a discussion of the Chechen conflict at the U.N. Security Council, because the conflict in Chechnya has major implications for international peace and security. Please allow me to end my testimony with an expression of thanks and a plea. I will be returning to Ingushetia soon, and I want to bring a message of hope to the victims of this war, the Chechen civilians who had nothing to do with why this war started yet who have suffered the greatest. I want to be able to tell them that the west cares about their suffering, and that they have not been forgotten. I will take copies of the Senate resolution adopted last week--Thank you for that expression of concern. But my plea is that your engagement not begin and end there--that you exercise sustained leadership towards establishing US policy towards Russia that insists on accountability and an end to violations.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/28/qa-return-pinochet-chile","QA on the Return of Pinochet to Chile","Q&A on the Return of Pinochet to Chile","","02/28/2000","Q. How likely are the Chilean courts to prosecute Pinochet?    A. There are legal obstacles to Pinochet's prosecution in Chile, including:    his immunity from criminal process as a senator for life;     an amnesty decree that covers crimes committed from 1973 to 1978;     a proposed constitutional reform that would make it more difficult to challenge that immunity in court;     a statute of limitation which makes it difficult to try torturers after five years have elapsed since the crime; and     the wide jurisdiction of military courts which would be unlikely to prosecute their former patron. However, the courts have powers to strip Pinochet of his immunity, and the Supreme Court has pronounced the amnesty law to be inapplicable in """"disappearance"""" cases. President Ricardo Lagos has promised publicly not to interfere in the actions of the courts, and opposition leader Joaquin Lavin has stated that Pinochet is subject to the law like any other Chilean citizen.    Q. What is the status of the cases against Pinochet now in Chilean courts?    A. Pinochet currently faces 59 criminal complaints in Chile for kidnapping, murder, and torture, all of which were lodged in 1998 and 1999 and are currently being investigated by Judge Juan Guzman Tapia of the Santiago Appeals Court. The cases are in the preliminary stage of investigation and Judge Guzman has yet to make formal charges against Pinochet. He sent a list of questions last year to Pinochet in London, but Pinochet, in his reply, refused to provide substantive answers.     The charges against Pinochet include the abduction, torture, disappearance, and execution of thousands of political opponents. The crimes for which Pinochet is closest to indictment include his command responsibility for a military task force, popularly known as the """"Caravan of Death,"""" which removed scores of prisoners from jail and executed them one month after the 1973 military coup. Before the case against Pinochet can go ahead, Judge Guzman must first have Pinochet's senatorial immunity lifted.    Q. What is the procedure for revoking Pinochet's immunity?    A. Judge Guzman must request the Santiago Appeals Court to lift his parliamentary immunity. If the Appeals Court assents, Pinochet may appeal to the Supreme Court, which has the final say. If the Supreme Court declines to revoke his immunity, the indictment cannot proceed.    Q. Would the proposed constitutional reform give Pinochet additional ways to evade prosecution?    A. The proposed reform would allow Pinochet to retire from the Senate, while retaining for life his senatorial privileges, including his salary and parliamentary immunity. Pinochet's lawyers would presumably argue that the procedures for lifting parliamentary immunity (desafuero) do not apply to ex-presidents, to whom the Constitutional reform would accord a special status.     Human Rights Watch has called on President Frei to abandon this reform proposal which adds an extra obstacle to Pinochet's trial in Chile. Unless Frei does so, the proposal is likely to become law in the final week of March.    Q. What legal devices will enable human rights activists to get around the amnesty law?    A. Judge Guzman ruled last year that the amnesty is not applicable to crimes involving abduction and """"disappearance,"""" since such crimes are """"ongoing, unless the victim can be legally established to have died during the period covered by the amnesty decree (1973-1978).     Some nineteen victims of the Caravan of Death remain unaccounted for, and the perpetrators of these crimes therefore are not subject to amnesty. The Supreme Court unanimously confirmed this doctrine in July 1999, when it upheld the indictment on kidnapping charges of a former general and four senior former army officers who belonged to the Caravan of Death unit. Effectively, therefore, the amnesty could not prevent Pinochet from being tried for """"disappearances,"""" although it may shield him for prosecution for other crimes, such as torture and extrajudicial execution.     Human rights lawyers in Chile may also argue that the amnesty law is invalidated by the provisions of international human rights law, which establish that crimes against humanity may not be subject to amnesty or statutes of limitation. Judging from earlier decisions, however, the Supreme Court is unlikely to endorse this doctrine.    Q. Given Pinochet's status as a former army officer, would Judge Guzman not have to surrender the case ultimately to a military court?    A. Pinochet could contest Guzman's jurisdiction on these grounds, and the dispute over jurisdiction would ultimately have to be settled by the Supreme Court. Among the arguments the Supreme Court would have to take into account is whether the crimes were committed on military premises, and whether they could be considered """"acts of service""""by a military officer. The Chilean courts have traditionally given wide scope to military jurisdiction in such cases.    Q. Could Pinochet's lawyers block prosecution on humanitarian grounds, citing his ill-health or mental impairment?    A. Under Chilean law, even grave illness does not constitute legal grounds for the termination of legal proceedings. Only irreparable dementia or mental impairment may constitute such legal grounds. Judge Guzman is obliged by law to have Pinochet examined to establish whether he is mentally capable of facing trial, suffering from temporary disabling mental impairment (in which case the proceedings may be suspended), or irreparable dementia, in which case they would be terminated.     This examination is carried out by doctors attached to the state forensic service (Servicio Medico-Legal), which is independent of military control. If he requires permanent medical treatment, Pinochet could be admitted to Santiago's Military Hospital. Pinochet's British medical records do not have the same status in Chile as medical reports from an authorized forensic doctor, but probably would be considered relevant evidence by a Chilean court.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

Diplomats are meeting in New York from February 28 to March 3 to prepare for the U.N. Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects, scheduled to take place sometime in the year 2001. This week's meetings represent the first gathering of the so-called Preparatory Committee that will set the agenda for the 2001 Conference and draft final documents. The Conference is expected to lead to a """"plan of action"""" for governments, the outlines of which are still unclear.  """"Governments have talked about the need to stem the proliferation of small arms,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, Executive Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch, """"But talk is cheap. It's time to take action to halt small arms flows to human rights abusers.""""  In armed conflicts around the world, small arms are the weapons most widely used to commit abuses against civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law.  Hiltermann said that governments are largely responsible for the illegal trade in small arms, and the ease with which abusive armed forces obtain weapons. """"Many of the weapons on the black market at some point were legally transferred by governments or with government approval,"""" he stated. """"And governments have failed to rein in unscrupulous arms traffickers or enforce arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers.""""  Human Rights Watch spelled out its position in a memorandum to delegates. It called on U.N. member states to ensure that the 2001 Conference results in concrete efforts to halt weapons flows to forces that have consistently abused human rights or violated international humanitarian law. The three priority areas identified by Human Rights Watch for action by U.N. member states were:  Adoption of binding codes of conduct on arms transfers;  Establishment of transparency measures, including annual reporting and the creation of registers; and  Strict implementation and enforcement of arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers.","Global","Arms, United Nations"

In a separate letter to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, the group urged the board to reconsider its decision not to recommend clemency for Beets. """"This is the perfect opportunity for Governor Bush to display his much touted ‘conservative compassion,'"""" said Allyson Collins, Senior Researcher, Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization, expressed the concern that Beets' trial attorney was not fit to represent her. He failed to present mitigating evidence of spousal abuse at Beets' sentencing. In addition, Beets' trial attorney did not disclose evidence indicating Beets had not killed her husband for financial gain, an aggravating factor that led to her death sentence. Had the attorney testified on Beets' behalf to present this evidence, he would have been forced to excuse himself from her case and relinquish media rights Beets had agreed to give him to pay for his legal services. Beets' attorney was subsequently convicted for criminal actions in another death penalty case and sentenced to federal prison. In light of the allegations of spousal abuse, the inadequate legal counsel Beets received, and her trial attorney's apparent conflict of interest, Governor Bush can and should exercise his right to grant a thirty-day reprieve and urge his Board of Pardons and Paroles to further consider this case.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

The Human Rights Watch report links three prominent Army brigades based in Colombia's largest cities to paramilitary activity and attacks on civilians. Together with previous reports, Human Rights Watch has so far documented ties between half of Colombia's eighteen Army brigades and paramilitaries. In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. government to strengthen human rights conditions on any security assistance to Colombia's military. The letter expressed grave concern that a $1.3 billion aid package proposed by the Clinton administration does not require clear, measurable steps to break links between the military and paramilitary groups. """"When an aid package of this size is debated in Washington, it's crucial that the facts be clear,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division. """"And the facts we've established about links between the Colombian military and paramilitaries are truly alarming."""" Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring organization based in New York. Its 1998 report, """"War Without Quarter: Colombia and International Humanitarian Law,"""" described in depth the murders, """"disappearances,"""" and other abuses being committed by the Colombian security forces, paramilitaries, and guerrillas in the country's 50-year-old war. More than 1.5 million civilians have been displaced by the fighting since 1985. The report released today, entitled """"The Ties That Bind: Colombia and Military-Paramilitary Links,"""" shows that military support for paramilitary activity remains national in scope, and includes areas where units receiving or scheduled to receive U.S. military aid operate. The report relies on Colombian government documents and extensive interviews with government investigators, refugees, and victims of political violence. Several prominent investigators interviewed by Human Rights Watch were forced to flee the country because of their work collecting evidence on military-paramilitary collaboration. Among the report's conclusions: As recently as 1999, Colombian government investigators gathered compelling evidence that army officers set up a """"paramilitary"""" group using active-duty, retired, and reserve-duty military officers along with hired paramilitaries who effectively operated alongside army soldiers and in collaboration with them; In 1997, 1998, and 1999, a thorough Colombian government investigation collected compelling evidence that Army officers worked intimately with paramilitaries under the command of paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño. They shared intelligence, planned and carried out joint operations, provided weapons and munitions, supported with helicopters and medical aid, and coordinated on a day-to-day basis. Some of the officers involved remain on active duty and in command of troops; There is credible evidence, obtained through Colombian government investigations and Human Rights Watch interviews, that in 1998 and 1999, army intelligence agents gathered information on Colombians associated with human rights protection, government investigative agencies, and peace talks, who were then subjected to threats, harassment, and attacks by the army, at times with the assistance of paramilitary groups and hired killers; There is credible evidence that this alliance between military intelligence, paramilitary groups, and hired killers is national in scope and is able to threaten key investigators in the Attorney General's office and the Procuraduría; The brigades discussed -- the Third, Fourth, and Thirteenth -- operate in Colombia's largest cities, including the capital. Their commanders are considered among the most capable and intelligent, and are leading candidates for promotion to positions of overall command of divisions, the army, and Colombia's joint forces; Colombia's civilian investigative agencies, in particular the Attorney General's office, are capable of sophisticated and hard-hitting investigations. However, many investigators assigned to cases that implicate the army and paramilitaries have been forced to resign or to flee Colombia; At least seven officers mentioned in the report are graduates of the School of the Americas, a Georgia-based military training institute financed by the U.S. government. """"Training alone, even when it includes human rights instruction, does not prevent human rights abuses,"""" said Vivanco. """"You also need determined action on the part of the Colombian government to bring offenders to justice.""""A 1997 decision by Colombia's Constitutional Court requires that security force personnel accused of committing crimes against humanity be tried in civilian courts. Yet Colombia's military continues to win jurisdiction over high-ranking officers implicated in abuses, and its tribunals reliably acquit or simply fail to prosecute them. Vivanco noted that the Leahy Amendment, which became U.S. law in 1997, established a vital precedent for requiring adherence to human rights standards. However, Human Rights Watch believes that additional benchmarks are necessary to ensure that the Colombian government follow through on promises to address atrocities. Vivanco also noted that abuses directly attributed to members of the Colombian military have decreased in recent years, but over the same period, the number and scale of abuses attributed to paramilitary groups have skyrocketed. """"The Colombian military should not get a clean bill of health until it severs its ties to paramilitaries,"""" said Vivanco. """"U.S. assistance should not be provided either to those who directly commit human rights abuses or to those who effectively contract others to carry out abuses on their behalf and with their assistance.""""

""""It is becoming increasingly clear that these are not isolated incidents,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We are uncovering a pattern of summary executions throughout Grozny."""" In the last few days, Human Rights Watch interviewed six witnesses who were in the Aldi district of Grozny at the time of the killings, or who traveled there to find out about the fate of their relatives. These witnesses described a consistent picture of the brutal events that took place on the morning of February 5. A large group of Russian soldiers, possibly more than one hundred, went to the Aldi district and systematically murdered civilians in their homes and on the streets. Soldiers looted and burned numerous houses and demanded money from civilians, sometimes promising to spare their lives if they agreed to pay. Several witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch also alleged that Russian soldiers had raped at least two women. Forty-one-year-old Sapiyat was in the Aldi district when the Russians soldiers entered it on February 5. She told Human Rights Watch: """"We heard that everyone should be out in the yards or the streets with their passports, that is why we all went out and were expecting [the soldiers] to come any minute. Then... we started hearing gunshots from the other side of town.... When the soldiers were passing through Voronezhskaia Street, they killed everyone in their path, the same with Mazayev, Zemlyanskaia, and Bryanskaia street.... """"  By the time the soldiers reached Sapiyat's street, the worst was apparently over. She said that soldiers fired into her street as they appeared from the corner but then told everybody to """"go home."""" She said that soldiers looked into some yards and houses but left when they realized that the houses had already been destroyed and that there was little left to loot. She told Human Rights Watch about the killing of Alvi Ganayev, aged sixty-one, and his two sons Aslambek, aged thirty-four, and Salambek, aged thirty-one. They were apparently killed in Voronezhskaia street as they returned from repairing a roof that had been damaged by shelling. Alvi's wife found their bodies underneath a pile of corpses in the street: """"She recognized the clothes of her younger son and tried to pull him out of the pile,"""" said Sapiyat. """"Then the soldiers saw her and started firing in her direction."""" A young man who ran over to help the woman was hit and died three days later from his wounds. Sapiyat saw the bodies of the members of the Ganayev family when she went to pay her condolences to the mother. Thirty-six-year-old Larisa (not her real name) told Human Rights Watch that she went to the Aldi district on February 10 to look into the fate of her relatives. Local families told her that on February 5 Russian soldiers had asked Akhmed Abalkhanov, a seventy-four-year-old relative of Larisa's, for money. When he gave them 300 rubles, the soldiers threw it back in his face, saying """"You have dollars and only want to give us rubles."""" Akhmed went back into the house and came out with U.S.$100, but then was shot by the soldiers who were evidently upset that he had tried to hide the dollars. When his daughter-in-law Louisa attempted to intervene, she was brutally beaten. Soldiers then set the house and stable on fire, killing six cattle inside. Local families also told Larisa that soldiers had taken away thirty-two-year-old Shamkhan Baigiriyev, who had been wounded in shelling, and that his burned body was found six days later in a cellar. After the soldiers left, surviving inhabitants from the district apparently counted a total of eighty-two dead bodies, some of which could not be identified because Russian soldiers had set them on fire. Human Rights Watch has so far obtained the names of sixty-two victims of the Aldi killings. Attached below is a list of thirty-four names, each of which was reported by at least two sources who were interviewed separately. Human Rights Watch continues to investigate the executions in the Aldi district, but its investigation has been severely hampered by the Russian army's apparent attempts to conceal these crimes. Several witnesses told Human Rights Watch that Russian soldiers had returned to the district on February 9 to warn civilians not to bring the abuses to the attention of the international community. They apparently told several men, """"We have not seen you, you have not seen us. It will be better this way for you and for us. Otherwise, you know what will happen."""" Several witnesses of the events of February 5 in the district refused to talk to Human Rights Watch out of fear of retaliation.  Russian troops have effectively sealed off Grozny from the outside world. As a result, very few civilians are able to leave the city to tell about the abuses that have taken place. On February 10, Human Rights Watch issued a report detailing the summary executions of thirty-eight people by Russian soldiers in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny (https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/russia_chechnya/). Since then, the organization has confirmed the summary executions of another twelve civilians from that district. Their names are also listed below. Human Rights Watch has also received information on the execution of a family of five, including a pregnant woman and a one-year-old child. Russian soldiers apparently killed them in Oktyabrski district of Grozny on February 5, and tried to burn their bodies. Their names are also listed below.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/22/hrw-letter-albright","HRW Letter to Albright","HRW Letter to Albright","","02/22/2000","Dear Madam Secretary:  I wish to draw your attention to information obtained by Human Rights Watch that provides  detailed, abundant, and compelling evidence of continuing close ties between the Colombian Army  and paramilitary groups responsible for gross human rights violations. We strongly urge you to  place strict conditions aimed at upholding respect for human rights on all U.S. security assistance  provided to the Colombian military. This information was compiled by Colombian government investigators and Human Rights Watch. Several of our sources, including eyewitnesses, have requested anonymity because their lives are under threat as a result of their testimony.  Far from moving decisively to sever ties to paramilitaries, our evidence strongly suggests that Colombia's military high command has yet to take the necessary steps to accomplish this goal. Our information implicates Colombian Army brigades operating in the country's three largest cities, including the capital, Bogotá. If Colombia's leaders cannot or will not halt these units' support for paramilitary groups, the government's resolve to end human rights abuse in units that receive U.S. security assistance must be seriously questioned. In previous Human Rights Watch reports and documents, we have detailed credible and compelling evidence contained in government and other investigations of continuing ties between the military and paramilitary groups in the Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Fourteenth, and Seventeenth Brigades.  Together, evidence collected so far by Human Rights Watch links half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level army units (excluding military schools) to paramilitary activity. These units operate in all of Colombia's five divisions. In other words, military support for paramilitary activity remains national in scope and includes areas where units receiving or scheduled to receive U.S. military aid operate. We have drawn this information to the attention of the appropriate Colombian government ministers and officials, and have urged them to take immediate action to address these continuing problems in accordance with existing Colombian law. Based on the enclosed evidence, Human Rights Watch found that:  As recently as 1999, Colombian government investigators gathered compelling evidence that Army officers set up a """"paramilitary"""" group using active duty, retired, and reserve duty military officers along with hired paramilitaries who effectively operated alongside Army soldiers and in collaboration with them; In 1997, 1998, and 1999, a thorough Colombian government investigation collected compelling evidence that Army officers worked intimately with paramilitaries under the command of Carlos Castaño. They shared intelligence, planned and carried out joint operations, provided weapons and munitions, supported with helicopters and medical aid, and coordinated on a day to day basis. Some of the officers involved remain on active duty and in command of troops; There is credible evidence, obtained through Colombian government investigations and Human Rights Watch interviews, that in 1998 and 1999, Army intelligence agents gathered information on Colombians associated with human rights protection, government investigative agencies, and peace talks, who were then subjected to threats, harassment, and attacks by the army, at times with the assistance of paramilitary groups and hired killers; There is credible evidence that this alliance between military intelligence, paramilitary groups, and hired killers is national in scope and is able to threaten key investigators in the Attorney General's office and the Procuraduría; The brigades discussed here -- the Third, Fourth, and Thirteenth -- operate in Colombia's largest cities, including the capital. Their commanders are considered among the most capable and intelligent, and are leading candidates for promotion to positions of overall command of divisions, the Army, and Colombia's joint forces. If Colombia's leaders cannot or will not halt support for paramilitary groups in these units, it is highly questionable to assume that they will be more successful in units that are less scrutinized or operate in rural areas, including units that receive U.S. security assistance in southern Colombia; As these cases underline, Colombia's civilian investigative agencies, in particular the Attorney General's office, are capable of sophisticated and hard-hitting investigations. However, many investigators assigned to cases that implicate the Army and paramilitaries have been forced to resign or to flee Colombia; At least seven officers mentioned in the attached report are School of the Americas graduates. Training alone, even when it includes human rights instruction, does not prevent human rights abuses. It must be accompanied by by clear and determined action on the part of the Colombian government to bring to justice those in the military who have committed human rights abuses, to force the military to break longstanding ties to paramilitary groups, and to ensure that the Colombian Armed Forces are subject to the rule of law, including the August 1997 Constitutional Court decision that mandates that security force personnel accused of committing crimes against humanity are tried in civilian courts. In your statements on Colombia, you have rightly identified respect for human rights as an important element in shaping U.S. policy, and we welcome that. We can all recall the serious and shameful failures of U.S. policy in the hemisphere during the Cold War, when human rights were repeatedly ignored, undermined, or openly contravened in favor of continued support for the region's most brutal and abusive regimes, among them Chile under General Pinochet. With your invaluable support, the United States has begun to declassify many of the records on the United States' involvement in Chile.  None of us wish that experience repeated. Given the poor record of the Colombian military, it is particularly important that human rights safeguards form a centerpiece of U.S. policy and that concerns about the control and the direction of security assistance be directly and thoroughly addressed. The Leahy Amendment established a vital precedent for requiring adherence to human rights standards. Below, we set out measurable benchmarks that the United States should require of Colombia before any further U.S. security assistance is made available. These benchmarks should be used as a basis for monitoring compliance and for immediately suspending aid in case of any breach. 1. All U.S. security assistance should be conditioned on explicit actions by the Colombian Government to sever links, at all levels, between the Colombian military and paramilitary groups. Abuses directly attributed to members of the Colombian military have decreased in recent years, but over the same period the number and scale of abuses attributed to paramilitary groups operating with the military's acquiescence or open support have skyrocketed. U.S. assistance should not be provided either to those who directly commit human rights abuses or to those who effectively contract others to carry out abuses on their behalf. The actions that the Colombian government should be required to take include:  devising and implementing a comprehensive and public plan to investigate, pursue, capture, and bring to justice paramilitary leaders, one that provides sufficient resources and guarantees the necessary political support to accomplish these goals. The U.S. Secretary of State should report to the U.S. Congress at three-month intervals to certify that measurable progress, including the capture and prosecution of paramilitary leaders according to Colombian law and with full guarantees of due process, is taking place; providing a significant increase of funding for the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit, including increased support for the Witness Protection program, travel, communications equipment, increased security, and improved evidence-gathering capability. The work of Colombia's Attorney General's office has contributed significantly to the protection of human rights and accountability for serious crimes, including crimes committed by Colombia's guerrillas. Yet prosecutors and investigators continue to run deadly risks. Many have been forced to leave the country because of threats against their lives, leaving the fate of crucial cases in jeopardy; establishing the ability at the regional and local level to respond to threats of massacres and targeted violence, including the creation of a rapid reaction force to investigate threats and killings, and to take steps to pursue and apprehend alleged perpetrators in order to bring them to justice;  With regard to U.S. training of Colombian military and police, we urge you to ensure that: all U.S. advice and training includes detailed instruction regarding the obligation of all members of the military and security forces to uphold Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and Protocol II. Training should include hypothetical situations that reflect Colombian reality, and students should be closely evaluated on their understanding and application of international humanitarian law. Specialists from the International Committee of the Red Cross should be invited to contribute to such training; all existing training materials are reviewed in coordination with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Defensoría del Pueblo, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Colombian Attorney General, and a representative of independent human rights groups, to ensure that they reflect the highest standards of protection for human rights and international humanitarian law; all trainees, whether of officer rank or below, receive appropriate instruction in human rights and international humanitarian law.  2. The information submitted by Human Rights Watch shows clearly that intelligence-sharing remains the most pervasive and common method of collaboration between the Colombian military and paramilitary groups, with grave consequences for human rights. Intelligence is by definition a central function of any army, and is clearly so in the case of the Colombian military. Addressing the problems such information-sharing poses defies a unit-by-unit approach. Therefore:  observing the aim of the Leahy Amendment, the United States should apply human rights conditions to all intelligence-sharing, to ensure that information is neither shared with human rights abusers nor with those who will pass it to paramilitary groups that violate human rights; for the purposes of compliance with the Leahy Amendment, the United States should make it clear that aiding and abetting any paramilitary group would result in a unit being disqualified for receipt of further U.S. aid or training until effective measures are taken to investigate and punish violations. For example, should a particular antinarcotics battalion be found to be directly abusing or collaborating in the abuse of human rights, immediate steps should be taken by the U.S. to halt assistance to the entire brigade;  any increase in security assistance should mean a proportionate increase in civilian staff assigned to the U.S. Embassy and State Department to oversee compliance with human rights conditions. Staff should be required to meet frequently with not only military and government sources of information, but also independent human rights groups, the church, and aid organizations. The goal must be to gather as much information as possible about reported human rights violations;  a report on monitoring activities in countries where the Leahy Amendment applies should be a regular part of the State Department's annual report on human rights and should be available for independent review. 3. The """"effective measures"""" set out in the Leahy Amendment should be interpreted to include, among other measures, the rigorous application of the August 1997 ruling of Colombia's Constitutional Court, which requires that crimes against humanity allegedly committed by military personnel be investigated and tried in civilian courts. Neither the military nor the Superior Judicial Council charged with resolving jurisdictional disputes have abided by this ruling to date. as a condition of U.S. security assistance, the Government of Colombia should first require the military to respect civilian jurisdiction in cases involving credible allegations of human rights abuse by military personnel, including cases where officers are accused of conspiring to commit or facilitate murders and massacres by paramilitary groups. In this way, President Pastrana can ensure that such cases are sent to civilian courts, best equipped to investigate them impartially and guarantee due process; the United States should require that the Colombian military set up an independent review committee, composed of high level representatives from the Attorney General's office and the office of the Procuraduría, to assess whether there is credible evidence of human rights abuse against individual officers and soldiers. If such credible evidence is found, the individual should be immediately suspended and the case sent to the civilian courts for prosecution. If found guilty, the individual should be permanently dismissed from the security forces;  to reinforce sanctions on abusive security force members, the United States should conduct a review of all visas granted to military personnel and ensure that individuals against whom there is credible evidence of human rights abuse or support for paramilitary groups have their visas revoked or are denied visas to enter the United States;  to strengthen accountability, the United States must urge Colombia to reform the rules governing investigations and disciplinary proceedings carried out by the Procuraduría. The Procuraduría is the government agency that oversees the conduct of government employees, including members of the military and police, and can order them sanctioned or dismissed. Currently, however, delays in investigation mean that many investigations into serious human rights crimes must be shelved due to excessively short statutes of limitations. Also, the crime of murder is not included as a reason for dismissal. Even when the Procuraduría finds that a member of the security forces has committed murder, it can recommend no more stringent punishment than a """"severe reprimand,"""" simply a letter in the individual's employment file;  the United States must require that Colombia void the statute of limitations for investigations into crimes against humanity and other, related human rights violations. 4. Further, the United States should urge Colombia to pass and rigorously enforce laws that protect human rights including laws penalizing forced disappearance, unlawful detention, and torture. Legislation that officially recognizes and supports the work of the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit should also be supported by the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá. 5. Human rights defenders are among the most at-risk groups in Colombia. The United States should support their work by increasing funding for non-governmental groups that apply for assistance from the Agency for International Development. Funds should help strengthen their ability to investigate and report on human rights violations. 6. The United States should provide increased funding for Colombia's forcibly displaced, not only those who may be forced to abandon their homes because of future coca eradication efforts. Currently Colombia ranks third in the world in terms of the number of forcibly displaced people. Aid should be channeled through the church and independent aid and human rights groups rather than the government, in view of the latter's previous failure to follow through with promised assistance.

The Chilean parliament is expected to pass the new measure by the end of March. """"This law would make it virtually impossible to prosecute Augusto Pinochet back home in Chile,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Chilean government should be trying to strengthen, not weaken, the country's democratic institutions."""" In the coming weeks, U.K. Home Secretary Jack Straw may allow Gen. Pinochet to leave England, where he was arrested in October 1998. Gen. Pinochet arranged """"senator-for-life"""" status for himself, when he left power in 1990, thereby ensuring his immunity from prosecution. But since the former dictator was arrested in London, the Chilean judiciary has proved more willing to consider lawsuits against him.  If Pinochet returned from London and if he were not exempted from prosecution on the grounds of ill health, Chilean lawyers and human rights activists had hoped to sue for the outright revocation of his immunity. The proposed constitutional reform would vastly complicate that undertaking. Most countries in Latin America grant their legislators and/or public officials immunity from criminal prosecution, but in most cases it ends when they retire, and it covers only the period when the person is actually in office. Chile's new law would give its public officials the most extensive immunity on the continent. """"The proposal would give blanket immunity not only to Pinochet, but to any other dictator who might come after him,"""" said Vivanco. """"It would set them completely above the law, no matter how brutal or corrupt their regimes may be.""""  On January 19, with the country in the midst of its annual summer holidays, President Eduardo Frei gave the proposal """"high urgency"""" status, and the Chamber of Deputies approved it without modification on January 25. The matter has received strikingly little debate in the Chilean press. By law, the bill must be approved by both chambers of parliament, meeting in plenary, within sixty days. It could therefore become law in the last week of March.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch has been involved in documenting and monitoring this serious human rights violation for many years.   Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs by Regan E. Ralph, Executive Director Women's Rights Division, Human Rights Watch International Trafficking of Women and Children   February 22, 2000   My name is Regan Ralph, and I am the Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. It is a pleasure to be here today, and I appreciate the attention this committee is devoting to the growing human rights problem of trafficking in persons.   Trafficking in persons -- the illegal and highly profitable transport and sale of human beings for the purpose of exploiting their labor -- is a slavery-like practice that must be eliminated. Human Rights Watch has been involved in documenting and monitoring this serious human rights violation for many years. We have reported on the trafficking of women and girls from Bangladesh to Pakistan (Double Jeopardy), from Burma to Thailand (Modern Form of Slavery), and from Nepal to India (Rape for Profit). We have also conducted extensive research regarding other incidences of trafficking, including the trafficking of women from Thailand to Japan and from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to Bosnia. Reports resulting from these investigations are forthcoming.   The number of persons trafficked each year is impossible to determine, but it is clearly a large-scale problem, with estimates ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of victims worldwide. The State Department estimates that each year, 50,000-100,000 women and children are trafficked into the United States alone, approximately half of whom are trafficked into bonded sweatshop labor or domestic servitude. Trafficking is also a truly global phenomenon. The International Organization for Migration has reported on cases of trafficking in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, South America, Central America, and North America. And press reports in the past year have included accounts of persons trafficked into the United States from a wide variety of countries. In August 1999, a trafficking ring was broken up in Atlanta, Georgia that authorities believe was responsible for transporting up to 1000 women from several Asian countries into the United States and forcing them to work in brothels across the country. Four months later, a man pleaded guilty to keeping five Latvian women in involuntary servitude in Chicago. He had recruited the women from Latvia with promises of $60,000-a-year wages. But when they arrived, he pocketed most of their earnings and forced them to work by confiscating their passports, keeping them under constant surveillance, and threatening to kill them and have their families murdered if they disobeyed him.   Trafficking patterns   In Human Rights Watch's documentation of trafficking in women, we have found that while the problem varies according to the context, certain consistent patterns emerge. Furthermore, while our research has focused on the trafficking of women and children into the sex industry, reporting from numerous credible sources shows similar patterns in the trafficking of women, men, and children into forced marriage, bonded sweatshop labor, and other kinds of work. In all cases, the coercive tactics of traffickers, including deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, threat and use of physical force, and/or debt bondage, are at the core of the problem and must be at the center of any effort to address it.   In a typical case, a woman is recruited with promises of a good job in another country or province, and lacking better options at home, she agrees to migrate. There are also cases in which women are lured with false marriage offers or vacation invitations, in which children are bartered by their parents for a cash advance and/or promises of future earnings, or in which victims are abducted outright. Next an agent makes arrangements for the woman's travel and job placement, obtaining the necessary travel documentation, contacting employers or job brokers, and hiring an escort to accompany the woman on her trip. Once the arrangements have been made, the woman is escorted to her destination and delivered to an employer or to another intermediary who brokers her employment. The woman has no control over the nature or place of work, or the terms or conditions of her employment. Many women learn they have been deceived about the nature of the work they will do, most have been lied to about the financial arrangements and conditions of their employment, and all find themselves in coercive and abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous.   The most common form of coercion Human Rights Watch has documented is debt bondage. Women are told that they must work without wages until they have repaid the purchase price advanced by their employers, an amount far exceeding the cost of their travel expenses. Even for those women who knew they would be in debt, this amount is invariably higher than they expected and is routinely augmented with arbitrary fines and dishonest account keeping. Employers also maintain their power to """"resell"""" indebted women into renewed levels of debt. In some cases, women find that their debts only increase and can never be fully repaid. Other women are eventually released from debt, but only after months or years of coercive and abusive labor. To prevent escape, employers take full advantage of the women's vulnerable position as migrants: they do not speak the local language, are unfamiliar with their surroundings, and fear of arrest and mistreatment by local law enforcement authorities. These factors are compounded by a range of coercive tactics, including constant surveillance, isolation, threats of retaliation against the woman and/or her family members at home, and confiscation of passports and other documentation.   Government efforts to combat trafficking in persons have been entirely inadequate. In many cases, corrupt officials in countries of origin and destination actively facilitate trafficking abuses by providing false documents to trafficking agents, turning a blind eye to immigration violations, and accepting bribes from trafficked women's employers to ignore abuses. We have even documented numerous cases in which police patronized brothels where trafficked women worked, despite their awareness of the coercive conditions of employment. And in every case we have documented, officials' indifference to the human rights violations involved in trafficking has allowed this practice to persist with impunity. Trafficked women may be freed from their employers in police raids, but they are given no access to services or redress and instead face further mistreatment at the hands of authorities. Even when confronted with clear evidence of trafficking and forced labor, officials focus on violations of their immigration regulations and anti-prostitution laws, rather than on violations of the trafficking victims' human rights. Thus the women are targeted as undocumented migrants and/or prostitutes, and the traffickers either escape entirely, or else face minor penalties for their involvement in illegal migration or businesses of prostitution.   These policies and practices are not only inappropriate, they are ineffective. By making the victims of trafficking the target of law enforcement efforts, governments only exacerbate victims' vulnerability to abuse and deter them from turning to law enforcement officials for assistance. By allowing traffickers to engage in slavery-like practices without penalty, governments allow the abuses to continue with impunity.   Trafficking in Women: Case Studies   Drawing on Human Rights Watch research, I will provide a few specific examples that illustrate the pattern outlined above. I will then offer recommendations for measures the U.S. government can take to combat this modern form of slavery and provide redress for its victims.   Thailand to Japan   From 1994 to 1999, Human Rights Watch carried out an extensive investigation of the trafficking of women from Thailand into Japan's sex industry. We will be publishing a report on trafficking into Japan later this year. We interviewed numerous trafficking victims directly, and received information regarding many more cases from local advocates and shelter staff in Japan and Thailand. Our findings indicate that thousands of Thai women are trafficked into forced labor in Japan each year, their rights violated with impunity as the Japanese and Thai governments fail to respond adequately to the problem.   Statements by the Thai and Japanese governments have made clear that they are well aware of these abuses. However, this has not been translated into effective measures to provide women with the means to protect themselves from abuse or to seek redress for violations. When Japanese authorities raid establishments that employ trafficked women, the women are arrested, detained in immigration facilities, and summarily deported with a five-year ban on reentering the country. This punitive treatment is applied regardless of the conditions under which the women migrated and worked in Japan, and even when there is clear evidence of trafficking and/or forced labor. Trafficking victims have no opportunity to seek compensation or redress, and no resources are provided to ensure their access to medical care and other critical services. Moreover, their traffickers and employers face little fear of punishment. If arrested at all, they are charged only with minor offenses for violations of immigration, prostitution, or entertainment business regulations.   The Thai government has adopted laws and policies aimed to combat trafficking in Thai women and assist victims in returning home. However, law enforcement efforts have so far proved ineffective, and women's vulnerability to trafficking persists. Many women continue to lack viable employment opportunities at home, and, at the same time, have no information about how to protect their rights overseas. In addition, the government has adopted overly broad policies aimed to prevent """"potential"""" trafficking victims from traveling abroad. For example, the passport applications of women and girls ages fourteen to thirty-six are subjected to special scrutiny, and if investigators suspect that a woman may be going abroad for commercial sexual purposes, her application is rejected. This policy, however well-intended, trades one human rights problem for another by discriminating against women seeking to travel and limiting their freedom of movement. It also makes women who want to migrate even more dependent on the services of trafficking agents, because it is difficult for women to obtain travel documents by themselves. Finally, the Thai government makes no effort to assist trafficked women in seeking redress.   The women we interviewed described the shock, horror and, often, powerlessness they felt when they discovered that contrary to their promises of lucrative jobs, they were saddled with enormous """"debts"""" and would not receive any wages until these amounts were repaid. This would require months -- or even years -- of unpaid work under highly coercive and abusive conditions. Those who had been promised jobs in factories or restaurants faced an additional blow when they learned from their employers or coworkers that their debt had to be repaid through sex work.   The women had been recruited for work in Japan by friends, relatives, or other acquaintances, who told them about high-paying overseas employment opportunities. The recruiters introduced them to agents who handled their travel arrangements and hired escorts to accompany the women to Japan. In some cases, the women became suspicious about their job offers during -- or even before -- their travel overseas, but once their agent had initiated the arrangements, they were closely supervised and felt they could not safely change their minds. Upon their arrival in Japan, the women were delivered to brokers who sold them into debt bondage in the sex industry. Most worked as bar """"hostesses,"""" entertaining customers at the bar and accompanying customers to nearby hotels to provide sexual services. While in debt, they could not refuse any customers or customers' requests without their employers' permission, and they often endured violence and other abusive treatment at the hands of both customers and employers. The women were also subjected to excessive work hours and dangerous health risks -- including the risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.   Excerpts from a few of their stories provide an idea of the slavery-like conditions they endured. In Thailand, Lee(1) had an alcoholic and abusive husband and three young children she was struggling to feed. When a recruiter offered to find her a job as a sex worker in Japan, she agreed. She told us, """"I knew there would be some debt for the airplane ticket and all, but I was never told how much."""" She found out after she arrived in Japan and was taken to a room by a broker to be sold. In her words, """"There were lots of women and people came to choose women and buy them. I was bought on the third day, and told that my price"""" -- and therefore her debt -- """"was 380 bai [approximately US$30,000]. After three or four days of working at the bar, I realized how much 380 bai was. The other girls said to me, 'That's a lot of debt and you're old. You'll never pay it off.' Then I prayed that it would only take six or seven months to pay it off, and I went with all of the clients I could.""""   Human Rights Watch also interviewed a woman who was promised a job in a Thai restaurant in Japan, but instead was taken to a bar where the other Thai """"hostesses"""" told her she would have to work as a prostitute. She recalled, """"They told me there was no way out and I would just have to accept my fate. I knew then what had happened to me. That first night I had to take several men, and after that I had to have at least one client every night.""""   Another woman we interviewed was released from debt after eight months of grueling, unpaid labor. According to Khai, """"I had calculated that I must have paid it back long ago, but the [bar manager] kept lying to me and said she didn't have the same records as I did. During these eight months, I had to take every client that wanted me and had to work everyday, even during my menstruation."""" Despite the terrible and coercive conditions, including physically abusive clients, Khai did not try to escape. Her manager had threatened to resell her and double her debt if she """"made any trouble,"""" and forbade her from going outside without supervision. The manager had also confiscated her passport, and, Khai explained, """"Without my documents I was sure I would be arrested and jailed by the police.""""   Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to Bosnia   In March 1999, Human Rights Watch traveled to Bosnia to document the incidence of trafficking in women from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. We interviewed trafficking victims, local and international officials, and local advocates. We also looked through police and court records and went to Ukraine to interview staff from La Strada, an NGO which has assisted many women returning from Bosnia. Our research indicated that since the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, thousands of women had been trafficked into Bosnia for forced prostitution.   At the time of our investigation, Bosnia was under the authority of a combination of local and international agencies. Our conversations with local police, representatives from the Joint Commission Observers, and members of the International Police Task Force indicated that all of these officials were well aware of the trafficking problem. They knew that foreign women were working in slave-like conditions across Bosnia, unable to leave the brothels. Nonetheless, little was done to prevent the trafficking of women into forced prostitution, or to provide redress or protection for victims. We even found evidence that some officials were actively complicit in these abuses, participating in the trafficking and forced employment of the women and/or patronizing the brothels.   The women had traveled from Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania, and Hungary, lured by promises of legal work and safe passage. When the women arrived in Bosnia, brothel owners seized their passports and subjected them to slavery-like practices. They were treated like chattel, often resold from brothel owner to brothel owner, and the promises of good incomes turned out to be lies: instead of being able to remit money home to their families and children, the women found themselves forced to work without wages. As Vika told Human Rights Watch, """"They tricked me. Everything was fine at first. But when we wanted to leave, the owner sold us for 1500 DM [approximately US$900]. The new owner told us that we had to work off three more months. He said he would sell us to another man."""" Most of the women had agreed to jobs in the sex industry, but when brothel owners refused to pay them, some women refused to work, incurring violent punishment. According to one woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch, """"Every time I refused to work, they beat me.""""   When authorities encountered trafficked women during brothel raids, they treated them like criminals, compounding the human rights abuses they had endured at the hands of their traffickers. The women were arrested, fined for their illegal immigration status and their illegal work as prostitutes, and then deported. And in early 1999, """"deportation"""" in the Bosnian context -- a country without an immigration law -- translated into being dumped across a border. From the Federation, women found themselves dumped in Republika Srpska. And vice versa. This pseudo-deportation scheme only facilitated the trafficking cycle. Women dumped across the internal borders could be quickly picked up and re-sold.   Burma to Thailand   Trafficking in persons is not a new phenomenon, and research conducted by Human Rights Watch in the early 1990s revealed similar patterns of human rights abuses, as well as similar levels of indifference -- and even outright complicity -- on the part of law enforcement officials.   More than six years ago, Human Rights Watch reported on the trafficking in Burmese women and girls into brothels in Thailand. We interviewed thirty trafficking victims in Thailand, and obtained many additional interview transcripts from a local NGO. Nyi Nyi's case was typical: She was recruited from Burma at age seventeen by a friend who had worked in Thailand. She had no idea what type of work she would do, but she agreed to go. When she met the agent, he gave her 15,000 baht (approximately US$600), which she gave to her sister. Then the agent sent Nyi Nyi to a brothel in northern Thailand, in a truck driven by a police officer. When Nyi Nyi arrived, she learned that the 15,000 baht from the agent was a """"debt,"""" which she would have to repay through prostitution. Nyi Nyi could not speak Thai, did not know where she was in Bangkok, and was always afraid of being arrested by the police. She never dared to talk to anyone, and she was relieved that the police who came to the brothel as customers never chose her. After about a year of working almost every day, she was told that she had repaid her debt, but did not have enough money to pay for a return trip to Burma. So she continued to work, and a short time later she was arrested during a brothel raid. The police initially promised that she would be taken back to Burma in a few days, but instead Nyi Nyi was sent to a reformatory for prostitutes, where she was confined for the next six months.   Nepal to India   In 1995, Human Rights Watch released another report on trafficking in persons, this one based on interviews with women and girls who had been trafficked from Nepal to India. Some were tricked by fraudulent marriage offers, others were sold by relatives, and a few were abducted. All ended up in the hands of trafficking agents who brought them to brothels and sold them into debt bondage. One of the women we interviewed explained that her husband had left her, and when a neighbor told her about an Indian man who wanted to marry her, she agreed. A meeting was arranged, but instead of eloping, her """"fiancé"""" drugged her and took her to a brothel in India. At the brothel, she was told that she had to work to pay off her purchase price of Rs.20,000 (approximately US$666). Each day she was forced to sit in a room in the brothel with the other women, and when a customer chose her, she could not refuse; those who tried were beaten and verbally abused. After working for ten years, serving nine or ten customers a day, she was still in """"debt."""" She told us, """"Nobody was allowed to leave after four years like people say they are."""" Finally she met a Nepali man at the brothel, and with his help, she managed to escape.   U.S. Policy -- Recommendations   Human Rights Watch commends the U.S. government for prioritizing trafficking in persons as a domestic and foreign policy concern. Senator Paul Wellstone has played a key role in mobilizing government efforts to combat trafficking in persons in a way that promotes and protects the rights of women and particularly trafficking victims. His leadership led to new legislation requiring the Department of State to increase and improve its reporting on trafficking in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. We hope that additional attention to this issue will help to close the gaps in the U.S. State Department's reporting on this subject. The report on Japan released last year, for example, alluded to the mistreatment of illegal workers, but trafficking and debt bondage were not mentioned, and the report asserted that """"there are presently no known cases of forced or bonded labor"""" in Japan.   In 1998, President Clinton identified trafficking in women and girls as a """"fundamental human rights violation,"""" and tasked the President's Interagency Council on Women with the challenging task of developing and coordinating government policy on this issue. Currently, the U.S. government is involved in several important initiatives. These include participation in the negotiation of a protocol on trafficking supplementing the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; implementation of foreign aid programs designed to prevent trafficking, assist victims, and prosecute traffickers; and consideration of legislation in the U.S. Congress against trafficking in persons.   As it participates in efforts to design and implement multilateral approaches to combating trafficking in persons, Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. government to promote human rights, and especially women's human rights, as the cornerstone of such efforts. This is of crucial importance in the negotiations for a protocol against trafficking in persons supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The final shape of this protocol will have significant implications for the effectiveness of multinational efforts to prevent and prosecute trafficking abuses, as well as for the protection and redress available to trafficking victims.   The United States is also involved in a number of other important discussions that will strongly influence the ways in which governments respond to trafficking in persons. In March of this year, the United States is co-hosting the Asian Regional Initiative Against Trafficking in Women and Children (ARIAT) in Manila, where Asian and Pacific nations will discuss national action plans and develop a regional strategy. At the G8 summit in Okinawa in July, the Group of Eight will have the opportunity to continue their discussions about joint efforts to combat trafficking in persons. Last month, Human Rights Watch sent an observer to a symposium on trafficking in persons in Tokyo that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sponsored in preparation for the G8 discussions. We hope that President Clinton, in his public and private remarks at the Okinawa summit, will stigmatize governments that are complicit in trafficking or tolerate trafficking. He should also use this opportunity revisit the plan of action to combat trafficking in persons adopted by the G8 Ministerial Meeting in Moscow last October, encouraging governments to enact domestic legislation necessary for the effective investigation and prosecution of those involved in trafficking and pressing for the inclusion of concrete measures to protect the rights of all trafficking victims.   The United States should take advantage of all channels and opportunities to promote a human rights approach to trafficking based on the following recommendations:  Defining """"trafficking"""" to encompass trafficking into all forms of forced labor and servitude -- in any occupation or labor sector -- including trafficking into forced marriage. The definition should also be limited to situations involving coercion, in recognition of men and women's ability to make voluntary decisions about their migration and employment, with coercion understood to include a full range of abusive tactics used to extract work or service.  Actively investigating, prosecuting, and punishing those involved in the trafficking of persons in countries of origin and destination, and imposing penalties appropriate for the grave nature of the abuses they have committed. Particular attention should be paid to evidence of collaboration by government officials in the facilitation of trafficking abuses.  Exempting trafficking victims from prosecution for any immigration violations or other offenses that have occurred as a result of their being trafficked.  Ensuring that trafficking victims have the opportunity to seek remedies and redress for the human rights violations they have suffered, including compensation for damages, unpaid wages, and restitution. This requires guaranteeing victims' access to legal assistance, interpretation services, and information regarding their rights, and allowing all trafficked persons to remain in the country during the duration of any proceedings related to legal claims they have filed.  Taking strong precautions to ensure the physical safety of trafficked persons. This includes witness protection measures for those who cooperate with law enforcement efforts and asylum opportunities for those who fear retaliation in their countries of origin. Countries of origin, transit, and destination must also cooperate to ensure the safe repatriation of trafficked persons, working together with non-governmental organizations to facilitate their return home.  Protecting women's rights and addressing the inequality in status and opportunity that makes women vulnerable to trafficking and other abuses. States should support policies and programs that promote equal access to education and employment for women and girls. They should also provide women with information about their rights as workers and how to protect these rights overseas. Programs should be designed and implemented with the cooperation of local non-governmental organizations.   There is increasing evidence that trafficking is on the rise in the United States as well. To effectively respond to the trafficking of persons into this country, we urge the U.S. government to enact domestic legislation that incorporates the standards outlined above. We welcome recent indications that law enforcement officials are increasingly charging traffickers with offenses appropriate to the serious nature of their crimes, but much remains to be done to improve the protections and services available to trafficked persons. Such measures are crucial for upholding the rights of victims and for encouraging them to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. In particular, we hope that such legislation will address this issue by:  Banning all forms of involuntary servitude and debt bondage as forced labor. U.S. statutory proscriptions on peonage and involuntary servitude have been narrowly interpreted to include only those situations in which victims are made to work through force of law or actual or threatened physical force. This excludes many of the slavery-like practices that Human Rights Watch has found common in cases of trafficking, in which labor is extracted through non-physical means such as debt bondage, blackmail, fraud, deceit, isolation, and/or psychological pressure.  Providing victims of trafficking with access to legal assistance, translation services, shelter, and health services, and ensuring that all trafficked persons are allowed to remain in the United States throughout the duration of any civil or criminal proceedings against their abusers.  Preventing the further victimization of trafficked persons by guaranteeing their immunity from prosecution for immigration violations or other crimes related to their having been trafficked, and taking adequate measures to ensure the protection of their physical safety. Such measures should include opportunities for all trafficking victims who fear retaliation upon return to their home country to apply for permanent settlement on that basis.   Trafficking in persons is a profound human rights abuse, and women are particularly vulnerable to this practice due to the persistent inequalities they face in status and opportunity. It is time for governments to take this problem seriously. Concrete steps are needed to prevent trafficking, punish traffickers and the corrupt officials who facilitate their crimes, and provide protection and redress for victims. This is a crucial moment in the fight against trafficking, with efforts underway in domestic, regional, and international fora to define appropriate state actions. It is imperative that the United States take advantage of this moment to demonstrate its leadership on this critical human rights issue.   1.

A top Russian military official has acknowledged Russia's intention to use fuel-air explosives (FAEs) in Chechnya. At a February 11 press briefing, Gen. Valery Manilov, Deputy Chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, said that fuel-air explosives, """"which are extraordinarily effective on caves, tunnels, or clefts, in mountain areas,"""" could be used in Chechnya """"if considered necessary."""" In December, Gen. Manilov had denied reports in the Russian and international media that FAEs were used in Grozny. Reports also alleged the weapons were used in the mountains of southern Chechnya, and in the Dagestani village of Tando in August 1999. """"Based on the Russians' military practices in the war in Chechnya so far, we have absolutely no faith that they will use fuel-air explosives responsibly,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"They shouldn't use these extremely destructive weapons in populated areas of Chechnya. Their use against populated areas would violate international norms on indiscriminate attacks."""" One Russian military expert has described the impact of FAEs as """"comparable to low-yield nuclear munitions."""" While FAEs are not explicitly banned under international humanitarian law, they are prone to indiscriminate use given their wide-area impact. Their use against populated areas would violate international norms on indiscriminate attacks. Human Rights Watch's letter to Acting President Putin noted that many villages in Chechnya's mountainous south were still populated by many civilians, including people displaced from other parts of Chechnya.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the large number of civilian casualties caused by the widespread and often indiscriminate bombing and shelling by Russian forces using more conventional munitions. Human Rights Watch researchers working in the Northern Caucasus have documented dozens of incidents in which Russian bombing and shelling have caused significant loss of civilian lives, ranging from large-scale incidents such as the October 21, 1999 attack on Grozny's central market, and the October 29, 1999 attack by Russian warplanes on a refugee convoy near Shaami-Yurt, to the countless other smaller-scale incidents throughout Chechnya.  To read a backgrounder on Fuel-air explosives prepared by Human Rights Watch, please visit https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/02/chech0215b.htm The letter to Acting President Putin is below. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OPEN LETTER February 14, 2000 President Vladimir Putin The Kremlin Moscow Russia  Dear President Putin, On behalf of Human Rights Watch, we are writing to express our deep concern about the reported use of fuel-air explosives against targets in southern Chechnya and the capital, Grozny. The use of fuel-air explosive bombs, known popularly in Russia as """"vacuum bombs,"""" would represent a dangerous escalation of the Chechnya conflict with important humanitarian implications. Fuel-air explosives (FAEs) have the potential to cause massive destruction over a wide area, and could cause extensive civilian casualties if used near populated areas. So far, the Russian military has reportedly used FAE bombs in the Dagestani village of Tando in August 1999, and more recently in the suburbs of Grozny and the mountains of southern Chechnya.  In addition, Human Rights Watch remains profoundly concerned about the large number of civilian casualties caused by the widespread bombing and shelling of civilian areas by Russian forces using other conventional weapons. Human Rights Watch researchers in the Northern Caucasus have documented dozens of incidents in which Russian bombing and shelling have caused significant loss of civilian lives, ranging from large-scale incidents such as the October 21, 1999 attack on Grozny's central market, and the October 29, 1999 attack by Russian warplanes on a refugee convoy near Shaami-Yurt, to the countless incidents in which shelling has resulted in civilian deaths and injuries throughout Chechnya. The indiscriminate nature of many of these attacks indicates that the Russian military authorities are not taking the necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties, as Russia is obliged to do under the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols. We are particularly concerned about the reported use of FAEs because they can be indiscriminate in effect, especially in or near populated areas. FAEs cover a wide area and are very destructive to personnel in fortifications, bunkers, and other buildings. Their use would be indiscriminate in Grozny, where Chechen fighters are reportedly dug in, and where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to remain trapped. In urban settings like Grozny it will be impossible for the Russian military to limit the effect of this weapon to combatants, and the nature of FAE explosions makes it virtually impossible for civilians to take shelter from their destructive effect.  Interfax reported that FAE-type weapons were used in a suburb of Grozny in December, and, according to unnamed military sources cited in Rossiskaya Gazeta, the Russian military used FAE-type explosions in September in southern Chechnya as well, endangering not only local inhabitants but also displaced persons from other areas of Chechnya. According to villagers from southern Chechnya interviewed by Human Rights Watch, many of the villages in the area have populations double or triple their peacetime population because of the heavy influx of displaced persons from other areas of Chechnya before the Russian offensive moved south. In southern Chechnya, civilians are trapped behind Russian lines, unable to flee combat areas because Russian commanders are unwilling to provide genuinely secure """"safe corridors."""" A similar situation exists in Grozny, with tens of thousands of civilians trapped and unable to flee the city to safety. Under these conditions, the use of FAEs could tragically lead to incidents in which an unacceptable civilian death toll is caused. Although much relevant information about fuel-air explosives remains classified, Russian and foreign experts agree on their destructive nature. According to one Russian military scientist writing for the Russian military magazine Voyennyye Znaniya (Military Knowledge), FAE weapons can be deployed against exposed personnel, combat equipment, fortified areas, and individual defensive fortifications, clearing passages in mine fields, clearing landing sites for helicopters, destroying communication centers, and neutralizing strongholds in house-to-house fighting in a city. """"In its destructive capability, [FAEs are] comparable to low-yield nuclear munitions,"""" concluded the Russian military expert. U.S. studies of the impact of FAE explosives are similar to Russian assessments. According to a 1993 study by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, """"The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique—and unpleasant.... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs.... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents.""""  Human Rights Watch respectfully urges you to: Refrain from using fuel-air explosives in the conflict in Chechnya; Create secure and clearly announced safe corridors for civilians wishing to flee areas of conflict, and ensure that these corridors are not fired upon or shelled when in use; and Implement adequate targeting precautions to protect civilians during shelling and bombing incidents.

The organization has received credible testimony to this effect from several former detainees from the Chernokozovo camp near Grozny. It also said that Russian forces in recent weeks had arbitrarily detained hundreds of Chechen civilians, mostly men, and expressed concern about their fate.  """"What's happening in these filtration camps is unspeakable,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"We saw the same kind of torture and ill-treatment in filtration camps during the last Chechen war. The Russians must not get away with committing these abuses for a second time."""" Three men who were recently released from the filtration camp at Chernokozovo described to Human Rights Watch in separate interviews the brutal abuses they suffered at the camp. Their testimonies were mutually collaborating and very detailed. The men are believed to be among the first to be released from the filtration camps after mass arrests started in mid-January. All three men were released after their families paid substantial bribes to Russian officials. The three men were each detained in mid-January at various checkpoints in Chechnya. Twenty-one-year-old """"Issa"""" (not his real name) told Human Rights Watch that he and ten other detainees were taken in a truck to Chernokozovo on January 17. As they descended from the vehicle, they were made to run through a corridor of rubber truncheon-wielding camp guards. He said: """"About fifteen or twenty soldiers were standing in two lines with rubber sticks. ... When I was running through the corridor, each soldier beat me with the sticks.... They made us undress and started checking our clothes. They took away the clothes they liked: my jacket, watch, money, hat, and gold ring were taken. For a week, I had to sit in the jail almost naked. An old man in the jail gave me some old clothes when he was released.""""  The other two men interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave similar accounts of being forced to run a gauntlet of camp guards and being stripped of their clothes and valuables. Issa told Human Rights Watch that on the second day of his detention, he and other inmates were again forced to run through a corridor, but this time, two of the guards had heavy metal hammers: """"Before I got hit by the hammer, I thought nothing could be worse than the rubber sticks. Then I realized the rubber stick was nothing in comparison with the hammer."""" Issa was hit in the back with a heavy hammer and still suffered from severe back pain four weeks later. All three men said camp officials had tortured them during repeated interrogations at the camp. Twenty-four-year-old """"Akmed"""" (not his real name) said: """"Each time we went to the interrogation room or were called out for some other purpose, we were beaten. The guards were wearing masks and would not let us look in their eyes. [Before the door of the interrogation room] I was ordered to fall down and crawl. They ordered me to take off my hat when I reached the door, and introduce myself: ‘Citizen Officer, thank you for seeing me. I am [name]. According to your order, I have crawled here.' ... I reached the room, and one guard beat me with an iron stick.""""  Issa told Human Rights Watch that out of twenty-one days he spent at Chernokozovo, he was not beaten on only three or four days. Two of the men also alleged that on several occasions guards had sprayed tear gas into the cells and that detainees were ordered to keep standing the entire day, with their hands raised. Thirty-eight-year-old """"Waha"""" (not his real name) said that the sixteen detainees in his cell were forced to relieve themselves on the floor because there were no toilet facilities available. All three men also told stories of rape. Waha gave detailed information about two rapes in the camp. On the second day of his detention, Waha heard the screams of a forty-two-year-old mother of four from Tolstoy-Yurt with whom he had arrived at the camp. """"The woman was beaten mercilessly,"""" Waha told Human Rights Watch. """"From the noise, I could guess she was being beaten with rubber sticks. She was beaten for fifteen minutes. Then for one half hour we didn't hear from her at all. We could hear everything that was going on in the jail, but couldn't see. In one half hour, we understood she was being raped. She was begging them not to do it. The soldiers were using bad language and this lasted for some time. Then everything stopped.""""  Waha also said that men were raped at the camp: """"They called one man out of his cell. They took him out and without saying anything, they started beating him very cruelly with their feet and truncheons. We could hear everything. Then the soldiers ordered him to undress. Then they laid him on something, maybe they tied him to something. Something was done to him, an act like pedophiles do, sodomy. We heard him say, ‘Please, please, this is not necessary.' After all this happened, the victim said, ‘You have killed me.' There were two or three such cases, the same thing happened twice to that same person, and I think another man. They renamed him Alla, they said, ‘From now on you will be Alla, a woman.'"""" The three witnesses were released in late January or early February after relatives had offered bribes ranging from one to four thousand rubles (approximately forty to one hundred and sixty U.S. dollars) to camp officials. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about a wave of arrests, mainly of Chechen men, following the retreat of Chechen fighters from the capital, Grozny. Russian soldiers have arbitrarily detained hundreds of men, depriving them of basic procedural rights and taking them away to undisclosed places of detention. Human Rights Watch has received reports of mass arrests from villages and towns throughout Chechnya. On February 3, Russian soldiers arrested nearly 300 wounded, including many wounded Chechen fighters but also civilians, from the village of Alkhan-Khala. Among those arrested in Alkhan-Kala were the Chechen minister of health, Umar Gambiev, together with five surgeons and a number of nurses. """"In many of these cases, the arrest appears to be based solely on the ethnic background of the men,"""" said Cartner. """"Such collective punishment for Chechen males is absolutely unacceptable."""" Human Rights Watch called upon the Russian authorities immediately to put an end to the abuses in the filtration camps and to allow a permanent international monitoring presence to monitor the conduct of Russian authorities in the camps. It condemned Russia's decision to deny Mary Robinson, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights, access to the region. The rights organization demanded that the Russian authorities immediately inform the family members of detained persons of their whereabouts and allow the families and legal representatives access to persons in detention.

In Iranian society generally, many petty social restrictions have been eased. The atmosphere surrounding the current parliamentary election campaign in Iran is notably freer than the last time around, in March 1996. But a number of human rights issues still impede a truly free and fair election in the Islamic Republic, and little has changed in the legal framework by which rights are protected in Iran. The human rights issues include:    Freedom of Association      Few political groups from outside the clerical circles of power are able even to operate in Iran. Those that do, such as the liberal Islamist Iran Freedom Movement, find their candidates excluded from standing for office. Several prominent figures in the Freedom Movement served as ministers in Iran's first post-revolutionary government in 1979, including the present leader, Ibrahim Yazdi. Dr. Yazdi was excluded from standing as a candidate in Tehran on the spurious grounds that he did not hold a higher education degree. (He in fact holds a Ph.D.) Ezatollah Sahabi, a former minister and an outspoken critic of the government was rejected for being a member of a prohibited political party. He is not in fact a member of any political party. Parviz Varjavand, also a former minister and a member of the National Front party, was excluded as a member of an illegal organization. There have never been any legal proceedings establishing the illegality of these political parties. The Freedom Movement lodged a formal complaint with the Ministry of Interior, but has had no effective redress.     The most popular reformist figure, the impeached former minister of the interior, Abdullah Nouri, was prevented from standing for the parliament because of his previous conviction. Abdullah Nouri was convicted by a Special Court for the Clergy for propagating heretical ideas at the end of 1999. Nouri would have been a popular figurehead for the reformists. However, because the vast majority of nominees have survived the screening process, voters are assured of having a range of reform-minded candidates in almost all constituencies.     Various attempts by opposition parties to hold election rallies were broken up by groups of conservative extremists whose actions were not prevented by the security forces.     In March 1996, the government-appointed Council of Guardians summarily vetoed some 44% of the nominated candidates, ensuring a victory for conservatives. This year, fewer than 8% of the 6,858 candidates who presented themselves as candidates for the 290 seats were barred from running by the screening process. But there has been no change in the essentially arbitrary process of excluding candidates on the basis of their religious or political beliefs. Such a process runs directly contrary to Iran's obligations under Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states:     Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 [of the Covenant, these are: race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.] and without unreasonable restrictions:     a. To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;     b. To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.     Athough this time around Iran's parliamentary elections offer more of a choice to the voters, albeit within the narrow confines of clerical rule, there has been no substantial improvement in legal protection of the right to take part in public affairs.     Freedom of Expression      Newspapers are the primary mobilizing tool of reformists. Many newspapers today take independent editorial positions and hold all parts of the government up to scrutiny and criticism.     However, the relative autonomy that the Iranian press currently enjoys does not rest on any firm basis of legal protection of the right to freedom of expression, nor even of respect for Iran's own press laws. Opposition newspapers have been repeatedly subjected to arbitrary closures. Publishers, editors and journalists have been prosecuted for expressing their opinions. Some have been targeted for political violence by vigilante groups. Writers were among those killed in a wave of as yet unresolved political killings at the end of 1998. Editors, publishers and journalists have also faced prosecutions by exceptional courts. For example, Abdullah Nouri, who like many prominent political figures had taken to publishing a newspaper, Khordad, was prosecuted by a Special Court for the Clergy because of the views expressed in that publication.     Despite the vulnerable situation of journalists in Iran, the press has continued to be an engine of change in the months leading up to the elections. The opposition press has given much attention to the screening process of parliamentary candidates, for example. That only a relatively small percentage of potential candidates was excluded from the poll may in part be attributed to the campaigning efforts of the independent press. One indicator of the increasing freedom of the Iranian press is that four years ago newspapers were not even permitted to carry an announcement for a memorial service on the first anniversary of the death of the leader of the Iran Freedom Movement, Mehdi Bazargan, the Islamic Republic's first prime minister who died in January 1995. This year many newspapers not only carried announcements, but also carried extensive reports on speeches made at the ceremony.     Freedom of the press in Iran remains limited. Those overtly opposed to clerical rule have no place in public debate, although much criticism of the clerics' political performance is now commonplace. The place of the Supreme Leader and the institution of velayat-e faqih (rule by the pre-eminent religious jurist) remains sacrosanct.     Persecution of Dissidents      Dissidents and critics still face arbitrary detention, unfair trial and other restrictions in Iran. Hundreds of students who took part in massive demonstrations in Tehran and other major cities in July 1999 remain unaccounted for, and it is believed that many of them are being held in detention. One student activist, Akbar Mohammadi, has been sentenced to death for his part in the disturbances.     Many other dissidents are still being detained. Bahram Namazi, Khossro Seif, and Farzin Mokhber, all leaders of Iran's Nation Party who are over 60 years of age, have been in detention since July 1999. The former designated successor to the leader of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Montazeri, who is an outspoken critic of Ayatollah Khamene'i, continues to live under house arrest in Qom. Scores of his supporters are detained. Many have faced prosecution in Special Courts for the Clergy for their heretical religious views, questioning the authority of the Leader.     In February 1999, a legal scholar, Mohssen Kadivar was detained and a case brought against him in a Special Court for the Clergy because of his outspoken writing. Former deputy-prime minister Abbas Amir Entezam, one the longest serving political prisoners in Iran, was returned to detention in October 1999 after giving a public interview. He had been conditionally released on medical grounds. Abdullah Nouri, tipped by many to emerge as Speaker in the new parliament, is instead serving a five year prison sentence. The prominent philosopher Abdol Karim Soroush continues to be prevented from teaching or delivering public lectures by violent extremists, although his ideas continue to inspire the reform movement.     The conflict between political factions has worsened the persecution of to religious minorities. Thirteen Jews accused of espionage have remained in detention for almost a year without any public judicial proceedings. Three of the thirteen were released from detention two weeks ago. but the threat of an as yet unscheduled trial continues to hang over them. The death sentences of three Bahais in Mashhad last week were referred to the Supreme Court. One had been arrested in July 1999; two others were detained in 1997 for holding unauthorized meetings.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran","Free Speech"

""""The case of Hafez Abu Sa'ada, General Secretary of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), clearly suggests that the Egyptian authorities are trying to muzzle human rights defenders in Egypt,"""" the international human rights organizations said. They further noted that this alarming development occurs as Egyptian human rights organizations await with concern the implementation of the controversial NGO law of 1999 regulating status and activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt. Hafez Abu Sa'ada has been charged with accepting a check of about $25,000 from the British embassy in 1998 without giving required notification to the authorities. According to official sources, he will be charged under military decree No. 4/1992, which was issued by the prime minister in 1992, carrying imprisonment of at least seven years.  """"The charges against Hafez Abu Sa'ada appear to be connected to EOHR's critical reporting on cases of human rights violations in Egypt,"""" the human rights organizations stressed.  First investigations into the case took place a few weeks after EOHR had published a highly sensitive report on human rights violations which had occurred in the summer of 1998 in the predominantly Coptic Christian village of al-Kushh, Upper Egypt.  The initial charges against EOHR were based on """"accepting funds from a foreign country with the aim of carrying out acts that would harm Egypt, receiving donations without obtaining permission from the competent authorities, [and of] disseminating false information abroad that would harm the country's national interests.""""  Investigations led to Hafez Abu Sa'ada's detention between 1 December and 6 December 1998, when he was released on bail after widespread protest by human rights organizations in Egypt and abroad. At the World Conference in Paris to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1998, he arrived after five days' detention in Tora Prison, Cairo. He was held in a cell of 2m by 2m with his head shaved and in prison clothes.  Amnesty International, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, and the World Organization Against Torture are calling upon the Egyptian authorities:  to drop the criminal prosecution against Hafez Abu Sa'ada.  to stop the use of exceptional (Emergency) Supreme State Security Court (ESSSC) - which allows no right of appeal.  to ensure that human rights defenders in Egypt can work in an environment without interference and harassment in accordance with the spirit of the UN Human Rights Defenders Declaration of 1998.  Background:  Military decree No. 4/1992 is based on the state of emergency legislation and prohibits the collection or receipt of donations without prior approval of the authorities. Article 2 of that decree stipulates imprisonment of at least seven years for violations of the decree. Egypt has been ruled under a state of emergency since 1981. The state of emergency, which has been regularly extended by presidential decree, expires in May 2000. EOHR has been operating under difficult conditions for many years. Since its establishment in 1985, the organization has not been able to obtain official registration and has continued to operate """"in formation."""" EOHR has recently applied for official registration under the new NGO law of 1999.  EOHR reported in January 2000 that it had learned by coincidence of an administrative decree issued in September 1999 which imposes a ban on the organization's journal """"Huquq al-Insan"""" (Human Rights) as well as on several publications of other institutions. The ban on EOHR's publication has so far not been enforced, but became known while EOHR was preparing a report on an incident of sectarian violence which occurred in the village of al-Kushh at the beginning of this year and left more than 20 people dead.  In May 1999 the Egyptian Parliament passed a new law, Law No. 153/1999, regulating the status of civil associations and institutions in Egypt. The law was criticized by national and international human rights organizations for giving the authorities far-reaching controls over nongovernmental organizations' (NGO) activities, including the work of Egyptian human rights groups. Cause for serious concern included that the law provides a set of criminal penalties, including a maximum sentence of one year in prison, for offenses that might amount to no more than the exercise of freedom of association.  The UN Human Rights Defenders Declaration of 1998 recognizes the rights and responsibilities of human rights defenders and requires governments to create an environment in which they can work without interference and harassment. Article 6 of the Declaration states: """"Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others:  (a) To know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to how these rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or administrative systems;  (b) As provided in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.""""

In a press conference on February 10, the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, Vojislav Seselj, directly accused Serbia's independent journalists of being """"traitors,"""" presumably for their critical stance on government policies. He added that he considered them """"accomplices"""" in the recent murder of Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, who was killed in a Belgrade restaurant on February 7.  The killers have not been found.  """"Such threats suggest that the Serbian government may use Bulatovic's murder as a justification to further crack down on domestic dissent,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division.  The Serbian government has long hindered the work of independent journalists.  Since October 1998, non-state affiliated media outlets have been fined high penalties thirty-three times for """"publicizing untruths which violate the rights of the individual,"""" under Serbia's draconian Public Information Law.  In five of these cases, Seselj or the party of which he is president, the Serbian Radical Party, brought the charges.  On April 11, unknown individuals murdered Slavko Curuvija, the editor of Dnevni Telegraf and  Evropljanin magazine, who had been openly critical of the government. A commentary on  state-run TV news three days before his death accused him of supporting the NATO bombing.  In an exchange with a journalist from the Belgrade-based radio station B2-92, Seselj threatened violence against the press and accused Serbia's independent journalists of working for a """"treacherous medium.""""  In response to a question, the Deputy Prime Minister stated, """"Now the gloves are off.  Anyone who works for the Americans must suffer the consequences.  What consequences?  The worst possible.""""  According to B2-92, Yugoslav Minster of Information Goran Matic said today in a press conference that he agreed with Seselj's comments, adding that some elements of the Serbian media were working to destabilize the country.  The radio also reported that the Association of Independent Journalists in Vojvodina today announced it would bring criminal charges against Seselj for his threats.  Excerpts of Seselj's threats against the media, provided by B2-92, are presented below:  Press Conference of Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj BELGRADE, Thursday, February 10  B2-92: What measures will the state take against state terrorism from the West?  Seselj: Our response will be adequate, based on the Constitution and the law, with the use of every instrument we have at our disposal for the defense of our country.  B2-92: Against whom?  Seselj: Against all who are instruments of Western countries. Against them all. Perhaps against your paper as well. You're from Novosti, right?  B2-92: B2-92.  Seselj: Ah! From B2-92! What's that? I've not heard about that. Is it registered? Minister, is there anything like that? Against all those who act on instructions from the West, who receive money from the Americans and their allies to act against Yugoslavia. In an adequate way. You are going to experience this adequate way in practice. The gloves are off. Now it's crystal clear: he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword, and all of you should bear that in mind. Don't think that we're going to let you kill us off like rabbits, or that we'll be coddling and caring for you like potted plants. Be careful! You from B2-92 and the other treacherous outlets. You can't really believe that you'll survive if we're executed. You're very wrong. Any more questions?  B2-92: Since this thing happened with Mr Bulatovic - this tragedy and crime - are you personally afraid, bearing in mind what you have said about the state terrorism currently being carried out by other countries? You're a prominent politician.  Seselj: You should know by now that I am afraid of nothing. Absolutely nothing!  B2-92: A few weeks ago, rumor had it that you'd been injured in an accident.  Seselj: Well you can see that I'm not hurt! Why would I be afraid? It's you who should be afraid. You work for a treacherous medium.  B2-92: It's not a treacherous medium.  Seselj: Ah! It's not a treacherous medium! All right! You can prove afterwards that it isn't.  B2-92: After what?  Seselj: After something. You'll see what. The gloves are off. You kill statesmen off like rabbits here, thinking you're safe. You're making a mistake. You're making a big mistake. Now the gloves are off. Anyone who works for the Americans must suffer the consequences. What consequences? The worst possible. You're working against your own country; you're paid American money to destroy your country. You're traitors, you're the worst kind! There's nothing worse than you! You're worse than any kind of criminals!  B2-92: That's not true, Mr Seselj.  Seselj: It's very true. It's completely true. You're traitors because you take money from the Americans and you always have. You're the same, the ones who took  money to kill the Defense Minister and you who are paid to spread propaganda  against your country. You're the same, the same criminals. I'm quite certain about that because they submit official reports about how much money they give you. And you're the same.  B2-92: Are you looking among journalists for the murderers?  Seselj: We're looking for the murderers among those of you who work for foreign intelligence services. You're accomplices in the murder. You're the same. You journalists think you're some kind of sacred cows? Some of you are cows, all right, but not sacred. You're murderers. You're murderers of your people and  your country, potentially. Yes, those of you working for the Americans: you from Danas, you from B92, you from Glas Javnosti, from Novosti, you from Blic. You're traitors to the Serbian nation.

Human Rights Watch has also learned that two more maimed bodies were found together with that of Magomet Goigov in a garage in Grozny. Human Rights Watch had earlier reported all three men as """"disappeared"""" in Russian custody. Relatives of the three men told Human Rights Watch today that Magomet Goigov's father and several others had traveled to Grozny to try to find the three men, who had last been seen in the custody of Russian soldiers on January 19. This group found the bodies of Magomet Goigov, twenty-two-year-old Risvan Taimaskhanov and forty-five-year-old Khamid Khashiev in a garage in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny, about one hundred meters from the place they were last seen. The relatives took the three bodies to Ingushetia for burial. The body of Magomet Goigov was taken to the Republican Hospital of Nazran, and the two other bodies to a morgue in Malgobek, northern Ingushetia. Human Rights Watch researchers attended the autopsy of Magomet Goigov at the hospital and observed the following wounds, including at least thirteen bullet wounds: a bullet through the right eye which shattered the back of the skull; a bullet through the right elbow; a bullet in the right thigh; multiple bullets which entered the body through the right side of the chest, and exited on the left side; bruises on the face and testicles; a severed right ear, apparently cut off with a knife; Human Rights Watch will make pictures of the body available as soon as possible. The other bodies apparently had similar wounds. Relatives of the three men said they believe that Russian soldiers sprayed them with submachine gun fire on the street on January 19 and subsequently dragged the bodies into the garage. The garage apparently had no signs of a shooting. In a report published on February 10 (see: Civilian Killings in Staropromyslovski District of Grozny, February 2000, Human Rights Watch reported that Goigov, Taimaskhanov and Khashiev had """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian soldiers in Staropromyslovski district when they tried to take an injured woman out of Grozny for medical assistance. Russian soldiers stopped them on Eight Liniya (Boulevar), shot the woman dead, beat up the three men, and then took them away to an unknown destination.

In a letter to Congo President Laurent Kabila, Human Rights Watch urged him to abide by his own government's pledges and immediately suspend any further executions ordered by the Court of Military Order.  """"These kinds of wholesale executions should not go forward under any circumstances,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch, """"but they should certainly not go forward in light of President Kabila's repeated promises to suspend the death penalty.""""  BACKGROUND REPORT ON THE COURT OF MILITARY ORDER IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO The Court of Military Order was established in 1997 by presidential decree law No. 019 shortly after President Laurent Kabila's government seized power in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Court initially had a narrow mandate of restoring military discipline in the capital Kinshasa and its area at a time when criminality and dissent were on the rise in the army. Following the outbreak of war against the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers in August 1998, the Congolese government expanded both the geographic coverage and legal mandate of the court with the addition of new chambers at Katanga, Kasai, and Bas Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts. The jurisdiction of the Military Court was further expanded on January 2, 1999 by Decree Law 171, which declared a state of emergency in regions then controlled by the rebels and their foreign backers. While the decree law has drawn little international attention, it granted the military sweeping powers over civilian administration by giving the military the authority to replace civilian authorities, appropriate private property, and to forcibly recruit civilians for the """"benefit, directly or indirectly, of national defense and the safeguarding of public security and interest.""""  The president appoints the judges of the Court of Military Order, and their decisions could only be reversed by him as the supreme holder of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in the country. In contravention of international law, Decree Law 019 establishing the court does not provide for appeal to a higher jurisdiction. However, the decree leaves the door open for pleas for presidential pardon in the case of death sentences. Despite this, many executions were carried out the same day as sentencing or shortly after, raising doubts as to whether requests for presidential pardon have been given due consideration. Since the clemency procedure is secret, it is difficult to know in how many cases pardon was actually requested and denied. President Kabila, who alone is empowered to commute the death sentences, is known to have granted only one pardon: a thirteen-year-old soldier who had been sentenced to death in late March 1998 for killing a Red Cross worker in Kinshasa was granted clemency on April 18, 1998. The second president of the Military Court told Human Rights Watch in a late 1998 interview that under the decree law establishing the court those condemned to death could be legally executed immediately following judgment. This violates principles both of the Congolese code of criminal justice and international norms.  Since its establishment, the functioning of this court has been marked by prolonged delays, a lack of due process, and a propensity to impose and execute the death penalty. In interviews with Human Rights Watch conducted in late 1998, court officials, including the then acting commander president of the court and a military public prosecutor, expressed their strong support for death sentences in order to eliminate """"suspected rebels, common criminals, ill-disciplined military, and collaborators with the enemy."""" According to reliable sources on the ground, more than 250 executions have been carried out by the Court of Military Order since its inception. The Court has increasingly been used for political repression, notably to punish nonviolent opposition and to muzzle outspoken critics of the government in the media and NGO sectors. Authorities have also used the court to punish civilians accused of economic crimes such as illicit dealings in foreign currency.

The organization also confirmed the deaths of sixteen more civilians in the Chechen capital. The total of confirmed summary executions in Grozny's Staropromyslovski district now numbers thirty-eight. Human Rights Watch has received further allegations that more than a dozen additional civilians may have been murdered in the district. In a letter sent today, Human Rights Watch called on Acting President Vladimir Putin to investigate the executions immediately and vigorously. [The letter appears below] """"President Putin must act on these terrible war crimes committed by Russian soldiers,"""" Holly Cartner said. """"The Russian government failed to respond appropriately to earlier reports of summary executions, and now such abuses have happened again."""" Human Rights Watch today also released a fifteen-page report (see: https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/russia_chechnya) detailing the cases of the twenty-two people it named in a February 7 press release (See Human Rights Watch release, """"Russian Forces Execute Grozny Residents,"""" February 7, 1999), as well as the cases of the sixteen persons whose deaths it just confirmed. Among the newly confirmed deaths are those of the entire Zubayev family. Two witnesses told Human Rights Watch that when Russian soldiers entered their neighborhood on January 19, they began house-to-house checking. After the soldiers had checked the documents of the people in the cellar where the two witnesses were hiding, sixty-eight-year-old Said Zubayev, the patriarch of the Zubayev family, announced that he was returning to his home: """"The Russians have come, now we are free. Let us go home."""" Said Zubayev left by himself, and an hour or two later, at about 3 p.m., his wife Zeinap and his daughter Malikah decided to join him. They found Said shot dead in the street on the way home, in an area which was then under Russian control. The two witnesses told Human Rights Watch that they heard Zeinap and Malikah Zubayev scream, ran toward the scene, and then helped the women bring the body of Said Zubayev to the Zubayev family home.  The next morning, on January 21, the two witnesses paid a visit to the Zubayev family home, only to find eight dead bodies in the yard. One of the witnesses told Human Rights Watch: What I saw was awful. All the members of the family were shot. Judging from the bullet casings, they were shot from a heavy submachine gun. Malikah and Luiza were holding their daughters. The house was still smoking, it had been burned. There were tracks of an armored personnel carrier in the yard. The gates were broken. Things from the house were thrown about, and all the luxurious things had been taken away. The house had been looted and the family had been killed. The Zubayev family consisted of: 1. Said Zubayev - aged sixty-eight 2. Zeinap Zubayeva - the wife of Said, aged sixty-four 3. Ruslan Zubayev - the son of Said and Zeinap, aged thirty-five 4. Malikah Zubayeva - daughter of Said and Zeinap, aged forty-five 5. Alina Zubayeva - daughter of Malikah, aged eight 6. Mariet Zubayeva - daughter of Said and Zeinap, aged forty-three 7.

I write to you today to urge a vigorous investigation into the conduct of Russian federal troops in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny, where, according to our information, Russian soldiers summarily executed at least thirty-eight civilians. We also believe that you should invite international agencies —intergovernmental and nongovernmental alike—to conduct their own investigations. We further renew our request for access to Chechnya—in particular to Grozny's Staropromyslovski district and to the village of Alkhan-Yurt, the site of earlier summary executions—to continue our investigations.  After interviewing more than a dozen survivors, eyewitnesses, and family members of victims from the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny, Human Rights Watch now has evidence that, after entering the district in December 1999, Russian soldiers committed a series of war crimes. Our research shows that Russian soldiers shot at least thirty-eight civilians, mostly women and elderly men, at close range. Six men """"disappeared"""" from the district after Russian soldiers took them away from their homes. Eyewitnesses further recounted how Russian soldiers forced residents of the district to risk sniper fire to recover the bodies of fallen Russian soldiers, and spoke of Russian soldiers looting and destroying civilian property as well. Human Rights Watch interviewed nearly all witnesses separately and at great length, and their testimonies were consistent, credible, and mutually confirming. In most instances, Human Rights Watch was able to interview witnesses who personally saw Russian forces execute the civilians, or who had convincing information placing Russian soldiers at the scene of the crimes.  We have set out the details of these summary executions and """"disappearances"""" in a fifteen-page report which we attach. Below, we list the names of the thirty-eight persons who were killed: 1. Anzor Taimaskhanov, aged sixteen 2. Lida Taimaskhanov, aged fifty-five 3. Adlan Akayev, aged forty-five 4. Larisa Jabrailova, aged forty-three 5. Heda, an ethnic Kumyk woman 6. Said-Selim Tungoyev, aged about fifty 7. Kosym Reshiev, aged about forty 8. Natasha Chernova, approximately fifty years old 9. Khava, aged about fifty 10. Lyusya, aged about forty-five 11. Unidentified neighbor from Shatoi, aged about forty-five 12. Mariam Goigova, aged fifty-nine 13. Abdulvagap Aslangeriev, aged seventy-five 14. Valentina Fotieva, aged sixty-seven 15. Hijan Gadaborcheva, aged sixty-seven 16. Ismail Gadaborcheva, aged seventy-four 17. Dugurkhan Archakova, aged fifty-six 18. Aisat Archakova, aged thirty- three 19.

Elza Kasayeva, aged fifty 38. Elza Kasayeva's mother, aged about eighty Human Rights Watch has also received allegations that possibly more than a dozen other civilians were summarily executed in Staropromyslovski district. We are still investigating these allegations and will keep you informed of our findings. In December, Human Rights Watch documented similar summary executions in the village of Alkhan-Yurt, just south of Grozny. According to interviews with two dozen residents from Alkhan-Yurt, Russian forces killed at least seventeen civilians after taking control of the village, and then engaged in widespread looting and burned down many of the homes in the town. Several cases of rape by Russian forces were also documented. Russian soldiers' conduct in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny and in Alkhan-Yurt violates Protocol II additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which protects, among other things, civilian immunity in internal armed conflicts. Article 4(2) forbids, inter alia, """"violence to the life, health and physical or mental well- being of persons, in particular murder. . .,"""" """"pillage,"""" and """"outrages upon personal dignity.""""  We urge you to pursue vigorously an investigation of the war crimes described in the attached report. We are deeply disturbed that despite promises to investigate the abuses in Alkhan-Yurt, Russian military officials appear to have done little to bring those responsible to justice, and that they have allowed such abuses to happen again. We respectfully remind you that under international law, Russia is obliged to investigate the crimes mentioned above and to bring those responsible to justice. We urge you personally to oversee the investigation into these war crimes. We also urge you to allow international bodies—intergovernmental and nongovernmental alike—to investigate the events and to grant them unfettered access to Chechnya, in particular to the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny and to Alkhan-Yurt. We take this opportunity respectfully to renew our own request, lodged in November, for access to Chechnya. I thank you for your attention to the concerns raised in this letter, and welcome your response.

We are  also deeply concerned about the fate of another sixty-one death row inmates currently held at  Pavilion 2 in the Reeducation and Penitentiary Center of Kinshasa (former Makala central prison)  whose execution appears imminent according to reports.  Human Rights Watch fears that the execution of the sixty-one death row inmate presently held at Kinshasa's central prison is imminent. A total of nineteen civilians and military personnel were executed in three groups: on January 28 and 31, and on February 2. Executions took place at the Provincial Inspectorate of Police and at Tshatshi military camp in Kinshasa, and at Maluku, about 60 km from the capital. Your government established the Court of Military Order by presidential decree in August 1997, shortly after it seized power. The Court initially had a narrow mandate of trying soldiers accused of disciplinary and other offences in the capital Kinshasa and its area in a drive to suppress an upsurge in criminality and dissent in the ranks. Following the outbreak of war in August 1998 against the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers, your government expanded both the geographic coverage and legal mandate of the court with the addition of new chambers at several centers in Katanga, Kasai, and Bas Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts. Since its establishment, the functioning of this court has been marked by prolonged delays, a lack of due process, and a propensity to apply and execute the death sentence. The Court has increasingly been used for political repression, notably to punish nonviolent opposition and to muzzle outspoken critics of the government in the media and NGO sectors. Authorities have also used the court to punish civilians accused of economic crimes such as illicit dealings in foreign currency.  Human Rights Watch urges your government to abolish the special Military Court and establish an independent judiciary that respects due process. Regular military courts should only handle cases of military personnel who are accused of committing military crimes. Trials in military courts should afford the accused all gaurentees of fair trial enshrined in international standards and Congolese justice codes, including the right to appeal and the right to counsel. The government should guarantee the competence, independence, and impartiality of all tribunals to ensure that civilians are not tried before military courts. Civilian and military judges, prosecutors, and other court officials should not be subject to intimidation or harassment related to their duties. More specifically, we urge your government to abide by the """"Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty,"""" adopted by Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984, that are representing a broad level of consensus by the international community. The Safeguards provide guidance for those countries that have not abolished the death penalty. The following Safeguards are of particular relevance to the aforementioned cases: 3. Persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime shall not be sentenced to death, nor shall the death sentence be carried out on pregnant women, or on new mothers, or on persons who have become insane.  5. Capital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent court after legal process which gives all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right of anyone suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings.  6. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to appeal to a court of higher jurisdiction, and steps should be taken to ensure that such appeals shall become mandatory.  7. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon, or commutation of sentence; pardon or commutation of sentence may be granted in all cases of capital punishment.  8. Capital punishment shall not be carried out pending any appeal or other recourse procedure or other proceeding relating to pardon or commutation of the sentence.

The rights group urged Jakarta-based diplomats and donors pledging aid to the new government to condemn the recent spate of killings of civilians in Aceh, and to insist that those responsible be apprehended and brought to justice. """"Civilians are increasingly being targeted in Aceh and the killers walk away untouched,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Justice must be done in these cases if there is to be any hope of defusing the conflict."""" Sukardi, a volunteer with the Bamboo Thicket Institute (Yayasan Rumpun Bambu Indonesia), a local environmentalist group, disappeared on January 31, 2000. According to reliable Acehnese sources, his naked corpse was found on February 1 riddled with bullet holes and showing signs of torture, including a swollen face and broken right hand. The perpetrator is unknown.  The killing of Sukardi is the most recent in a spate of recent killings of civilians. According to the Aceh office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Society, in January alone, there were 115 case of torture, twenty-one summary executions, thirty-three arbitrary arrests, seven people ‘disappeared,' and 416 homes and shops razed. Many of the victims were unarmed civilians. On January 25, 2000, the body of Nashiruddin Daud, 58, Indonesian MP from Aceh and vice-chairman of the parliament's commission of inquiry into rights abuses in Aceh, was found near a main street in the North Sumatran capital of Medan near Aceh. Nashiruddin had campaigned for the prosecution of military officers guilty of rights abuses in Aceh.  The killings are not the first of their kind. In the violence that has wracked Aceh for the past two years, there have been dozens of such killings, referred to in.Indonesia as """"mysterious shootings"""" (penembak misterious or petrus), a phrase first used by Indonesian authorities to describe a rash of killings of alleged criminals and thugs in Java in the early 1980s. President Soeharto later conceded that the army had been behind those killings.  In Aceh, both the army and the rebels have been accused of killing civilians suspected of being informants or of siding with the adversary, and there have been reports of dozens of such killings in the past year.  The most recent killings come as police gear up for operations they are calling Sadar Rencong (lit. """"Aware of the Acehnese Dagger""""), phase III. Police leaders say the goal of the operation is to apprehend some 800 rebels. Visitors to Aceh report a continued strong troop presence and an increasing violence on all sides despite Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid statements calling on security forces to use peaceful means wherever possible, rejecting a declaration of martial law for the province, and insisting on dialogue between civilian leaders and parties to the conflict.  Noting that the new police offensive and possible responses by armed rebels are likely to increase the danger to civilians, Saunders added: """"Existing cases of abduction and murder of civilians must be thoroughly investigated, and the perpetrators, whether soldiers or rebels, must be prosecuted. Otherwise, the low level of trust in government will be eroded even further.""""

The Pentagon review, released today in the course of Defense Secretary William Cohen's testimony before Congress, states that the bombing campaign was """"the most precise and lowest-collateral-damage air operation ever conducted"""" (p. xvii), but provides no evidence to substantiate this summary assertion, nor any discussion of how many civilians died, why, or whether these deaths could have been avoided.  Meanwhile, a 79-page Human Rights Watch report released yesterday documents that the number of incidents in which civilians were killed in the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia is at least three times as high as what the Pentagon has claimed. """"Congress should insist that the Pentagon produce a franker and more critical self-assessment,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Roth noted that for every bomb dropped and missile launched, civilians were roughly twice as likely to die in Yugoslavia as they were during the 1991 allied bombing campaign in Iraq.  """"The Pentagon failed to draw some important lessons about minimizing civilian casualties in the Gulf War,"""" said Roth. """"And it doesn't appear to have learned anything from the Yugoslav experience, either. Unfortunately, the lack of critical self-scrutiny in the Pentagon report means that the many needless deaths in Iraq and Yugoslavia may well be repeated in the next war."""" In its report on the Yugoslav bombing, Human Rights Watch identified four areas in which NATO fell short of its obligation to minimize civilian deaths. These included: its use of cluster bombs in populated areas, its attacks in populated areas during the day when civilians were most likely to be present, its attacks on mobile targets without ensuring that they were military in nature, and its decision to strike some targets of little or no military value despite a substantial risk of civilian death, such as Serb radio and television headquarters in Belgrade. Roughly half of the 500 civilian deaths in Yugoslavia are attributable to such conduct, which violated international humanitarian law. During the war, NATO tacitly but belatedly admitted several of these errors. In mid-May President Clinton secretly ordered an end to the use of cluster bombs. NATO commanders also ordered an end to daytime strikes in populated areas and insisted on greater certainty that mobile targets were military in nature before attacking them. These operational changes were welcome, but the Pentagon's report contains no acknowledgment of any need for changes in NATO doctrine or practice.  """"Both targeting doctrine and bombing practice need to be updated immediately to improve civilian protections,"""" said William Arkin, military consultant to Human Rights Watch. """"This was a war advertised as humanitarian in purpose, in which the Pentagon stressed that it was doing everything possible to minimize civilian casualties. Yet its report does not mention one measure taken or one lesson learned."""" To the contrary, the report contains a feeble justification of the ongoing utility of cluster bombs without acknowledging their unacceptable danger to civilians (p. 90). Similarly, in commenting on the Human Rights Watch report, Secretary Cohen and other NATO and Pentagon officials have made diversionary references to the more murderous conduct of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and to the fact that the 500 civilian dead is supposedly smaller than pre-war Pentagon estimates.  """"Those arguments are besides the point,"""" said Roth. """"NATO has an absolute duty to minimize civilian costs regardless of the conduct of its adversary and regardless of the accuracy of its pre-war predictions."""" Many of the lessons to be drawn from NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia should also have been drawn from Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, including lessons regarding the hazards of cluster bombs, the danger of daytime bombing in populated areas, and the importance of positively identifying mobile targets.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

The Human Rights Watch estimate of the number of incidents is far higher than what the U.S. Defense Department and other NATO governments have admitted. But the Human Rights Watch figures for civilian deaths is much lower than what the Yugoslav government has claimed.   """"Once it made the decision to attack Yugoslavia, NATO should have done more to protect civilians,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"All too often, NATO targeting subjected the civilian population to unacceptable risks."""" Roth urged NATO governments to make a serious evaluation of the war's effects on civilians.   Human Rights Watch conducted a detailed investigation of civilian deaths in the Yugoslav war, visiting ninety-one cities, towns, and villages in the former Yugoslavia over a three-week period in August 1999, and inspecting forty-two of the sites where civilian deaths occurred.   The investigation concluded that NATO committed violations of international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch called on NATO governments to establish an independent and impartial commission to investigate these violations and issue its findings publicly. NATO governments should also alter targeting and bombing doctrine to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch said.   The 79-page Human Rights Watch report reveals for the first time that U.S. commanders issued a secret executive order in May 1999 for U.S. forces to cease using cluster bombs, whose use had been documented in a Human Rights Watch report on May 11. As many as 150 civilians died in various incidents involving the use of cluster bombs until May 13. British forces continued using cluster bombs even after U.S. forces discontinued their use.   """"For a war with the reputation of being the smartest in history, there is an unfortunate pattern of NATO ignoring many important lessons from previous conflicts,"""" said William M. Arkin, military consultant to Human Rights Watch and the team leader of the Yugoslav bomb damage assessment. He said that restrictions on daylight attacks, prohibitions on the use of cluster bombs, greater care in attacking mobile targets, and more care in identifying military targets could all have reduced the level of civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force, as the NATO bombing campaign was known.   The Human Rights Watch report concludes that a third of all the incidents and more than half the deaths occurred as a result of attacks on illegitimate or questionable targets. Nine incidents were a result of attacks on targets that Human Rights Watch concludes were non-military in function. This includes the headquarters of Serb Radio and Television in Belgrade, the New Belgrade heating plant, and seven bridges that were neither major transportation routes nor had other military functions.   Other cases of illegitimate targeting include seven confirmed and five possible incidents where civilians died as a result of the use of cluster bombs, seven attacks on convoys, and a number of cases where the target was poorly identified or mistaken (such as the Surdulica sanitorium and the Palic weather station).   The report also reveals that after several daylight strikes on urban bridges resulted in civilian casualties, U.S. military commanders issued an order restricting attacks to periods when civilians would be less at risk.   Human Rights Watch concludes that about one-third of the incidents in which civilians died occurred in Kosovo, many of them attacks on mobile targets or military forces in the field. Attacks on convoys were some of the deadliest incidents of the war, and also resulted in NATO tightening rules of engagement so that pilots had to visually identify military vehicles before mounting attacks.   Thirty-three incidents that resulted in civilian deaths occurred as a result of attacks on targets in densely populated urban areas (including six in Belgrade). Despite the exclusive use of precision guided weapons in attacks on the capital, Belgrade experienced as many incidents of civilian death as any other city.   The Pentagon has suggested that only twenty to thirty incidents resulted in civilian deaths during Operation Allied Force. The Yugoslav government has claimed that NATO was responsible for at least 1,200 and as many as 5,000 civilian deaths.   Human Rights Watch is preparing further studies of NATO conduct during the war in Yugoslavia, including an assessment of NATO's bombing of civilian infrastructure.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","Arms, International Justice, Cluster Munitions"

Require transparency of disciplinary actions taken as a result of CCRB-substantiated complaints. Institute increased flexibility for disciplinary sanctions (allowing suspensions beyond thirty days). Increase penalties for remaining silent, or providing false information, regarding incidents of brutality or other misconduct. Eliminate the """"48-hour rule"""" and other unwarranted impediments to prompt, thorough investigations. End the current disconnection between civil lawsuits alleging police misconduct and the police department's force and complaint tracking systems. Require that the NYPD clarify how officers are selected for the Street Crime Unit and what kind of special training and supervision they receive to minimize violent encounters as they confiscate weapons. February 14, 2000 Mr. Bill Lann Lee Acting Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Division Department of Justice 10th and Constitution Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20530 Dear Assistant Attorney General Lee: As the New York Committee of Human Rights Watch Council, an organization deeply concerned about police abuse in the United States, we are writing to express our support for your pattern or practice inquiry of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). It is our understanding that your office's Special Litigation Section, together with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, is now negotiating with city and police officials in New York regarding your findings and reform recommendations. As Human Rights Watch wrote in its July 1998 report, Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States, we believe that your civil powers under the """"pattern or practice"""" statute are essential tools to improve police behavior and oversight. Because the NYPD is the largest police department in the country, and because many incidents of police abuse involving NYPD officers have received national attention, the importance of your inquiry cannot be overstated, both because of the improvements it can bring about in New York City and because of the example it sets for the rest of the country. Indeed, as an organization monitoring human rights around the world, we know that the NYPD's conduct attracts intense attention abroad and, when its conduct fails to meet international human rights standards, exposes the U.S. to condemnations by other countries and undermines U.S. efforts to promote human rights. We urge you to include the following recommendations as part of your reforms. The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) must be provided with adequate funding, qualified staff, and police department cooperation. Mandatory training must be provided for desk sergeants as well as others who may be approached by members of the public who try to file a complaint alleging police abuse. Intimidation, misinformation, or dissuasive tactics must be punished appropriately. Require that the transparency of disciplinary actions taken as a result of CCRB-substantiated complaints be improved. Numeric tallies of disciplinary actions are not sufficient -- the NYPD should provide information regarding the discipline imposed for specific incidents of abuse. CCRB investigators, or other CCRB staff, should be given a meaningful role in the police department's disciplinary process. As it is, the police department is responsible for administratively prosecuting officers accused of misconduct. Since the involved CCRB personnel are most knowledgeable about the cases they investigate, and because the presence and participation of non-police personnel would lend transparency and credibility to the disciplinary process, the CCRB should be involved. The """"48-hour rule"""" and other unwarranted impediments to prompt, thorough investigations should be eliminated. Increased flexibility for disciplinary sanctions should be provided. Currently, the Police Commissioner chooses among forfeiture of up to thirty days pay, suspension without pay for up to 30 days, or dismissal. Suspension of an officer should be permitted beyond thirty days. Additionally, the time limit requiring that disciplinary charges be filed within 18 months of the incident in question is unreasonably short and should be extended. The current disconnection between civil lawsuits alleging police misconduct and the police department's force and complaint tracking systems should be ended. Civil lawsuits paid by the city on behalf of the police department are at an all-time high, and are certain to continue to increase. During the fiscal year ending in June 1999, the city paid $40 million in taxpayers' dollars in settlements and judgments to plaintiffs alleging police abuse. These amounts should be paid by the police department as part of an effort to force the department to address systemic problems associated with officers who are repeatedly the subject of these lawsuits. Lawsuits should be part of the tracking systems designed to identify """"repeat"""" offenders on the force or those who show signs of becoming abusive. The CCRB, Internal Affairs Bureau, and supervisors of those named in lawsuits should be notified by the city's Law Department. All civil lawsuits filed should become part of the officer's personnel records unless deemed frivolous or patently unfounded by the courts. If a lawsuit claiming brutality or other misconduct is filed and the police department or CCRB has not already investigated the incident in question, an investigation should be opened. Furthermore, if a settlement or judgment is made in favor of plaintiffs, that information should be used to re-consider any complaint that was not substantiated originally. The department's tracking systems should be significantly improved, given the findings of the September 1999 interim report of the city's Public Advocate's office regarding """"repeat"""" offenders on the force. It reviewed 420 officers against whom CCRB had substantiated complaints between 1994 and 1997. Of those 420 officers, 306 (or 73 percent) had a prior history of misconduct, with an average of nine allegations in five cases reviewed by the Department prior to the case examined by the Public Advocate's office. One officer had amassed fifty-eight prior CCRB allegations. Require that the NYPD clarify how officers are selected for the Street Crime Unit, what kind of special training and supervision they receive to minimize violent encounters as they confiscate weapons, and how citizen complaints, civil lawsuits alleging police misconduct, and criminal charges against officers in this unit compare with the department as a whole. Penalties for remaining silent, or providing false information, regarding incidents of brutality or other misconduct should be instituted or increased. The code of silence remains one of the greatest obstacles to investigating allegations of police abuse and holding brutal officers accountable. Officers who provide information honestly and promptly should be rewarded, while superior officers should demonstrate to subordinates that silence will not be tolerated. Police union officials should be penalized for recommending to officers that they obstruct investigations by remaining silent or giving false accounts. Your office should oversee a review of standards used by the city's district attorneys' office to ensure that abuse cases rising to the level of criminality are being investigated and prosecuted adequately. The district attorneys' offices should also be required to provide the public with information regarding the number and type of cases considered for prosecution and its reasons for declining to prosecute cases involving alleged police officer misconduct. We are aware that some of these changes require new negotiations between the city and police unions, but that should not be an insurmountable impediment to improved accountability. We fully support your efforts to improve police practices and accountability in New York City. Significant changes are clearly needed, and we urge the Justice Department to take this opportunity to help put them into effect, whether through a negotiated consent decree or an injunction.

Human Rights Watch urged that the Russian troops responsible for the atrocities be brought to justice, and called upon the Russian authorities to take immediate steps to stop such abuses. """"The Russian troops who did this have crossed a terrible line,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These are not acts of war; they are acts of murder."""" Human Rights Watch researchers working in Ingushetia have interviewed more than a dozen survivors, eyewitnesses, and family members of victims who provided detailed and consistent information about the killings of twenty-two residents of Staropromyslovski district of Grozny, in eight separate incidents. The Staropromyslovoski district is located in the north-west of the capital city, and was the scene of heavy fighting between Russian forces and Chechen fighters in early to mid January. In most instances, Human Rights Watch was able to interview witnesses who personally saw Russian forces execute the civilians, or who had convincing information placing Russian soldiers at the scene of the crimes. Because of the continuing Russian offensive and encirclement of Grozny, few eyewitnesses to killings have been able to travel to Ingushetia. Russian military officials continue to deny Human Rights Watch access to Chechnya, making additional on-site investigations impossible. Human Rights Watch interviewed """"Lora"""" (not her real name) in an Ingush hospital where she was recovering from bullet wounds. On January 19, Lora was staying with three other women and two men in a cellar in Neftyanaya street in the Staropromoslovski district of Gronzy. In the afternoon, they heard machine gun fire outside the cellar. Soon, several shots were fired through the wooden door of the cellar. Khava, a woman about fifty years old, was wounded in the leg, and Lora also received some splinters in her legs. They yelled out to the soldiers, """"Please don't shoot us, we are local civilians,"""" and the soldiers ordered them to come out of the cellar with their hands up.  When they came out of the cellar, there were six soldiers in the yard. One had a grenade with the pin already pulled out, and wondered what to do with the grenade until another soldier told him to throw it out in the street. The soldiers accused the group of hiding Chechen fighters. However, the group denied the accusations, saying that they were only civilians.  The soldiers then told the group: """"Get back to the cellar and don't show up until the evening,"""" but after the group went back down into the cellar, the soldiers threw down several hand grenades. Lora cried to the soldiers: """"What are you doing? You promised not to kill us!"""" All six of the civilians in the cellar were wounded by the grenades. The soldiers ordered them to come out of the cellar again. One of the women was so seriously injured that she couldn't walk anymore. Lora told Human Rights Watch what happened next:  Then they started shooting at us from close range. When Natasha fell down she didn't already have fingers on her hand. People lying around me were still moving. I was all in blood and brains from other people. I was also wounded in the right side of my chest and blood was coming out through my mouth. Then soldiers decided that we were all dead and left. Lora was the only survivor of the incident. She identified the five persons killed as Khava, a dress designer of around fifty, Kosym Reshiev, about forty, Natasha Chernova, around fifty, Lyusya, about forty-five, and an unidentified neighbor from Shatoi, aged about forty-five. Human Rights Watch has documented similar summary executions in the village of Alkhan-Yurt, just south of Grozny, in early December. According to interviews with two dozen residents from Alkhan-Yurt, Russian forces killed at least seventeen civilians after taking control of the village, and then engaged in widespread looting and burned down many of the homes in the town. Several cases of rape by Russian forces were also documented. Despite promises to investigate the abuses in Alkhan-Yurt, Russian military officials appear to have done little to bring those responsible to justice or check abuses by their forces. """"There is no evidence that the Russian command is taking any steps to prevent these abuses or investigate them when they take place,"""" said Cartner. """"This lack of action makes the Russian command ultimately responsible for these abuses."""" According to the testimony of eyewitnesses and other family members collected by Human Rights Watch, the twenty-two persons who were killed are: 1. Anzor Taimaskhanov, aged sixteen 2. Lida Taimaskhanov, aged fifty-five 3. Adlan Akayev, aged forty-five 4. Larisa Jabrailova, aged forty-three 5. Heda, an ethnic Kumyk woman 6. Said-Selim Tungoyev, aged about fifty. 7.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/03/russian-journalists-fate-unknown","Russian Journalists Fate Unknown","Russian Journalist's Fate Unknown","Rights Group Calls on Russia to Account for Whereabouts","02/03/2000","In a letter to Acting President Vladimir Putin, Human Rights Watch today condemned the Russian government for exchanging journalist Andrei Babitsky for Russian soldiers held by Chechen rebels, which, according to a Russian government spokesperson, took place on February 3, 2000.  Mr. Babitsky, a correspondent for Radio Liberty, had been reporting from the besieged capital of Grozny when Russian forces detained him on January 15. He was held in incommunicado detention in Chechnya for over two weeks. On February 3, a Russian government spokesman claimed that Mr. Babitsky had been handed over to a Chechen military unit in exchange for two Russian prisoners of war. The spokesman said Mr. Babitsky signed a statement agreeing to this exchange. """"Not only are we concerned about Mr. Babitsky's treatment during his detention, we are especially troubled that no one has heard from him since the reported exchange,"""" said Holly Cartner, director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia divsion. """"The Russian government had an obligation to insure his safety and must now provide information about his release and whereabouts."""" Human Rights Watch also urged the Russian government to provide credible evidence that Mr. Babitsky was in good health at the time the exchange was said to have taken place. Human Rights Watch charges that if Mr. Babitsky was indeed exchanged for Russian prisoners of war, Russia had essentially treated him -- a noncombatant and a Russian journalist -- as if he were a hostage who was captured from enemy territory and then traded to the enemy for gain. The practice of taking noncombatants hostage is explicitly prohibited by common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and article 4 of Protocol II. Russia's treatment of Mr. Babitsky thus runs counter to the spirit of common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Protocol II. Human Rights Watch also questioned the voluntary nature of the agreement to be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war which Mr. Babitsky apparently signed, as Mr. Babitsky had no access to a lawyer during his incommunicado detention. Human Rights Watch stated that video footage of the exchange, shown on Russian television on February 4, did little to alleviate these concerns. """"The footage simply shows Babitsky being handed over to two unidentifiable men in masks, and it is unclear when or where the footage was shot."""" Human Rights Watch emphasized that the Russian government is responsible both for Andrei Babitsky's treatment in Russian detention, and his fate after the alleged handover to Chechen rebels. It urged the Russian government to: To clarify the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Babitsky's release; To provide the identity of the Russian and Chechen military units present at the time of Mr. Babitsky's """"release""""; To provide credible evidence that he was released in good health, and that his treatment in Russian detention was conform international standards; and Take all necessary measures to locate Mr. Babitsky and insure his safety.

We are writing to you today to express our utmost concern about the fate of Radio Liberty journalist Andrei Babitsky, who was detained by Russian forces about two weeks ago, and, according to a Russian government spokesman, was handed over to a Chechen military unit on February 3, 2000 in exchange for two Russian prisoners of war. Since the reported handover, neither Mr. Babitsky's family nor anyone else has heard from him and, more than twenty-four hours after he was reportedly released, his whereabouts remain unknown. Human Rights Watch is gravely concerned about Mr. Babitsky's security, and calls on you to clarify the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Babitsky's release, and to provide credible evidence that he was released in good health. Mr. Babitsky, a ten-year-veteran reporter for the U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty, had been reporting from the besieged capital of Grozny. His reporting was often critical of the Russian government's conduct of the war, and Russian officials had often accused Babitsky of being pro-Chechen in his accounts. Babitsky was initially reported missing on January 15, 2000. After denying for five days that they had detained Babitsky and suggesting that he may have disappeared at the hands of Chechen rebels, Russian authorities finally admitted on January 28, 2000 that Babitsky was in their custody. According to Russian news reports, Babitsky was detained by the Russian security service. The Interfax agency reported that Babitsky was charged with """"taking part in an illegal armed formation,"""" but this report has not been confirmed by Russian authorities. Ministry of Interior officials said on national television that Babitsky had been detained because he was not properly accredited. Babitsky was held incommunicado, without access to his lawyer or any communication with his family during the full period of his detention. Mr. Babitsky's detention and later treatment violates Russian and international law. According to Human Rights Watch's information, Mr. Babitsky was only doing his job as a journalist in Chechnya when he was detained. There is no evidence that he was involved in any illegal activities, as the Russian government now claims. His apparent lack of accreditation would not justify his detention for over two weeks under Russian law, and is a clear violation of international standards ensuring freedom of the press. It is also unclear why Mr. Babitsky was held for such a long time while several other journalists who had no accreditation were only for a short period and then released. What is more, according to both international and Russian law, Mr. Babitsky should have been promptly granted access to a lawyer and should have been given the opportunity to notify his family of his whereabouts. Initially, in late January, Russian officials informed Radio Liberty that Babitsky would be released under so-called """"city arrest,"""" which would prevent him from leaving Moscow. City arrest is commonly applied to persons under criminal investigation. However, on February 3, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russia's spokesman for the war effort, announced that Babitsky, an ethnic Russian, had been handed over to a Chechen rebel unit in exchange for two Russian prisoners of war at around 3:00 p.m. on February 3. He showed a statement Babitsky was said to have signed on January 31 agreeing to the exchange. Russian television later broadcast footage of what it said was Babitsky's handover, showing an unshaven Babitsky being escorted by Russian soldiers along a road and then given to two unidentifiable unarmed man wearing camouflage jackets and masks. There is also no indication of the date when the footage was shot. Several Chechen rebel sources have denied that the handover took place. Not only was Mr. Babitsky's initial detention a violation of international human rights law, but his exchange for Russian prisoners of war clearly violates international humanitarian law. The Russian government essentially treated Mr. Babitsky, a noncombatant and a Russian journalist, as if he were a hostage who was captured from enemy territory and then traded to the enemy for gain. The practice of taking noncombatants hostage is explicitly prohibited by common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and article 4 of Protocol II. Russia's treatment of Mr. Babitsky thus runs counter to the spirit of common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Protocol II. It is also highly questionable whether Mr. Babitsky voluntarily agreed to the exchange procedure, as the Russian government claims. By January 31, the date of Babitsky's signature, he had been held in incommunicado detention for over two weeks without access to a lawyer. However, whether he agreed to be turned over to the Chechen side or not, this does not minimize Russia's obligation to insure his safety. The claimed handover of Babitsky to Chechen rebels violates article 5(2e) of Protocol II which states that the physical or mental health and integrity shall not be endangered by any unjustified act or omission."""" It also violates article 5(4) of Protocol II, which states that """"if it is decided to release persons deprived of their liberty, necessary measures to ensure their safety shall be taken by those so deciding."""" By releasing Mr. Babitsky to a Chechen rebel unit in the middle of a war zone, Russia clearly failed to ensure Mr. Babitsky's safety. In fact, Mr. Babitsky should never have been held inside Chechnya. Article 5(2c) of Protocol II requires that places of detention """"shall not be located close to the combat zone."""" Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned over Babitsky's's well-being both at the time of the claimed handover and at present. Babitsky was held in Russian detention for more than two weeks, during which he was not allowed any contact with the outside world. This raises serious concerns about the conditions of his detention and the treatment he received. The footage shown on Russian television does little to alleviate these concerns. The footage shows a subdued though not visibly physically injured Babitsky being handed over to two unidentifiable men wearing masks. It is not even possible to tell from the footage whether these men are in fact Chechens. Disturbingly, nobody has heard from Babitsky even though he was more than twenty-four hours have passed since his """"release."""" It is thus neither clear whether Babitsky was in good health at the time of the claimed exchange nor whether he is now.  Mr. President, the Russian government is not only directly responsible for the treatment Andrei Babitsky received in Russian detention, it also is responsible for his fate after his claimed handover to Chechen rebels. We call on you: To clarify the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Babitsky's release; To provide the identity of the Russian and Chechen military units present at the time of Mr. Babitsky's """"release""""; To provide credible evidence that he was released in good health, and that his treatment in Russian detention was conform international standards; and Take all necessary measures to locate Mr. Babitsky and insure his safety. We look forward to your response.

It is the first time that a former African head of state has been indicted for atrocities by the courts of another country. Habre has lived in exile in Senegal since his ouster in 1990. """"This is a stunning victory for the Chadian people and for torture victims all over the world,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations which initiated the criminal action last week. """"Today's indictment is a wake-up call to dictators in Africa and elsewhere, that if they commit similar atrocities they could also be brought to justice one day."""" In papers presented to Judge Kandji, Human Rights Watch and the other groups provided details of 97 political killings, 142 cases of torture, 100 """"disappearances,"""" and 736 arbitrary arrests, most carried out by Habre's dreaded DDS (Documentation and Security Directorate). The groups also furnished documents describing how Habre placed the DDS under his direct supervision, staffed it with his close friends, and required that it report regularly to him. Seven individual Chadians and one Frenchwoman whose Chadian husband was killed by Habre's regime are acting as private plaintiffs, as is the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), which represents 792 victims of Habre's brutality. The Chadian plaintiffs were jubilant at today's decision """"Our pleas have been answered,"""" said Samuel Togoto, 53, who was beaten in prison while his hands and feet were tightly bound together behind his back, a common torture known as the """"Arbatachar.""""""""This is one of the happiest days of my life."""" Younous Mahadjir, 47, Vice-President of the Chadian Labor Confederation, who was also subjected to the """"Arbatachar,""""said that the judge's ruling was a """"triumph for those who are no longer with us. Today, my friends who were tortured, the people I saw die in jail, have finally achieved some justice."""" Habre, who appeared before Judge Kandji this afternoon to hear his indictment, remains in his villa on the outskirts of Dakar, which is now guarded by Senegalese gendarmes. Habre, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habre's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habre was deposed in December 1990 by current president Idriss Deby, who had been his army chief of staff. A 1992 truth commission accused Habre's regime of 40,000 political murders and 200,000 cases of torture and of stealing $11.6 million from the Chadian treasury. With many ranking officials of the Deby government, including Deby himself, involved in Habre's crimes, however, the new government did not pursue Habre's extradition. """"Senegal can hold its head up high today,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO).""""My country is setting an example for Africa by showing that Africans can take care of their own problems. The time when brutal despots could just take their bank accounts and move next door is coming to an end."""" Among those who also testified before Judge Kandji were Sabadet Totodet, a former prisoner who was ordered by the DDS to dig mass graves to bury Habre's opponents, and Ramadane Souleymane, whose brother, a regional lieutenant governor, was arrested and """"disappeared"""" in Habre's campaign against the Hadjerai. The effort to prosecute Habre was inspired by the case against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, said Brody of Human Rights Watch, which participated in the Pinochet hearings before the British House of Lords. Human Rights Watch sent investigators to Chad to prepare the documentation and witness testimony which was presented to the Dakar court. """"The Pinochet case reaffirmed the principles of international law that a country can judge the crime of torture no matter where the acts were committed, and that not even a former head of state has immunity from prosecution,"""" said Brody. """"But it also showed us that there are countries where these lofty principles can actually be applied in practice. Senegal can now be counted among those countries."""" Joining Human Rights Watch and RADDHO in support of the complaint were the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (ATPDH), the Chadian League for Human Rights (LTDH), the National Organization for Human Rights (Senegal), the London-based Interights, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) and the French organization Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme.","Africa, Chad, Senegal",""

Human Rights Watch called  upon the RCD to immediately and unconditionally release all detained activists, and to allow the local  human rights organizations and other non-governmental associations in eastern Congo to express their  views openly and to operate freely. Background: Outspoken and courageous members of civil society in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are again being threatened and attacked by the authorities of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy, (Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie (RCD), which is fighting against the government of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila and has taken control of large parts of eastern DRC with significant backing from the Rwandese government. On 29 January 2000, three members of civil society in Bukavu, South Kivu were arrested and taken to the Agence nationale de renseignements (ANR), the security service, in Bukavu. Two of them remain in detention: Patient Bagenda Balagizi is one of the main figures of the civil society and chairing an anti-poverty organization, the Comité Anti-Bwaki; Gustave Lunjwere is a church leader. The two men are accused of mobilizing the population and distributing tracts for a general strike to protest the lack of payment of wages, the taxation by the Rwandese, and the continuing presence in eastern Congo of foreign Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Despite the arrests and threats by the RCD against several suspected protest leaders, the strike took place peacefully on 31 January 2000 in Bukavu. Human rights activists are also being targeted in the Kivu region. On 16 January 2000 in the morning, security forces of the RCD arrested at her home Ms. Immaculée Birhaheka, President of the leading women's group Promotion and Support of Women's Initiatives (PAIF) in Goma. She was taken to the """"Bureau 2"""" detention center in Goma where she was whipped with a piece of tire. Her colleague Jeannine Mukanirwa, Vice President of PAIF, was arrested the same day. Several other women detained at the Bureau 2 were beaten during their detention, and some had to be transferred to hospital. Immaculée Birhaheka was released on the same day but received further visits by RCD soldiers at her house, threatening her and demanding money. Jeannine Mukanirwa was released on 18 January.  The arrest of the two women's rights activists was apparently linked to Mrs Mukanirwa's leading role in organizing a peace movement that brings together groups from rebel-held and areas controlled by the government of president Kabila. In December 1999, Mrs Mukanirwa had traveled from eastern DRC to Kinshasa to participate in a civil society meeting. She also publicly denounced the killings of civilians by the RCD, in particular reports that twelve women and two men were buried alive in mid November 1999 in Mwenga, South Kivu. Over the past few months, the RCD authorities repeatedly cracked down on human rights groups investigating and denouncing abuses committed by their forces. In August 1999, two independent journalists and a human rights activist from Héritiers de la Justice, a leading human rights association based in Bukavu, South Kivu, were detained for several days. In early January 2000, several members of Héritiers de la Justice were summoned because the organization had investigated reports of killings of civilians in Mwenga, South Kivu. Human Rights Watch calls upon the RCD to immediately and unconditionally release all detained civil society and human rights activists. Human Rights Watch urges the RCD to allow the local human rights organizations and other non-governmental associations in eastern DRC to express their views openly and to operate freely, including by granting them access to sites of reported killings. The RCD should bring to justice all perpetrators of ill-treatment, torture and summary executions in its ranks. The RCD should make it clear to all its combatants that human rights abuses will be punished.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/01/chechnya-conflict-use-vacuum-bombs-russian-forces","Chechnya Conflict- Use of Vacuum Bombs by Russian Forces","Chechnya Conflict: Use of Vacuum Bombs by Russian Forces","Backgrounder on Russian Fuel Air Explosives","02/01/2000","On December 27, 1999, Interfax reported Russian forces were using fuel-air explosive bombs in the fighting in Chechnya.(1) The use of fuel-air explosives (FAEs), popularly known in Russia as """"vacuum bombs,"""" represents a dangerous escalation in the Chechnya conflict--one with important humanitarian implications. FAEs are more powerful than conventional high-explosive munitions of comparable size, are more likely to kill and injure people in bunkers, shelters, and caves, and kill and injure in a particularly brutal manner over a wide area. In urban settings it is very difficult to limit the effect of this weapon to combatants, and the nature of FAE explosions makes it virtually impossible for civilians to take shelter from their destructive effect.    According to one Russian military scientist writing for the Russian military magazine Voyennyye Znaniya (Military Knowledge), FAE weapons are effective against exposed personnel, combat equipment, fortified areas and individual defensive fortifications, clearing passages in minefields, clearing landing sites for helicopters, destroying communication centers, and neutralizing strongholds in house-to-house fighting in a city.(2) In addition, he stated that """"fuel-air explosives are capable...of completely destroying in a given area vegetation and agricultural crops that have been planted."""" """"In its destructive capability, it is comparable to low-yield nuclear munitions.""""(3)     Used in large numbers, fuel-air explosives and other blast weapons can have enormous destructive effects. When multiple FAE warheads are exploded, the different blast waves reinforce each other, increasing their destructive power.(4) The effect of blast weapons is also compounded in buildings and other enclosed spaces, and is twelve to sixteen times more destructive than conventional high explosives against targets with large surface areas, such as frame buildings, bunkers, and vehicle shelters.(5)     Because FAEs cover a wide area, they are prone to indiscriminate use, especially in or near populated areas. Since this weapon is very effective against personnel in fortifications, bunkers, and other buildings, Russian forces may be tempted to use them in towns and cities where Chechen fighters are dug in. In urban settings it will be impossible for the Russians military to limit the destructive effect of this weapon to combatants and very difficult for civilians to take shelter from the FAE's effect.     So far, the Russian military has reportedly used FAE bombs against the Dagestani village of Tando, in August 1999,(6)and more recently in the southern mountains of Chechnya.(7)     How FAEs Work     A typical fuel air explosive device consists of a container of fuel and two separate explosive charges. After the munition is dropped or fired, the first explosive charge bursts open the container at a predetermined height and disperses the fuel in a cloud that mixes with atmospheric oxygen (the size of the cloud varies with the size of the munition). The cloud of fuel flows around objects and into structures. The second charge then detonates the cloud, creating a massive blast wave. (For a demonstration of a FAE explosion, see the U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, California, page at """"http://www.nawcwpns.navy.mil/clmf/faeseq.html"""".) The blast wave destroys unreinforced buildings and equipment and kills and injures personnel. The antipersonnel effect of the blast wave is more severe in foxholes, on personnel with body armor, and in enclosed spaces such as caves, buildings, and bunkers.     Fuel-air explosives were first developed, and used in Vietnam, by the United States. Soviet scientists, however, quickly developed their own FAE weapons, which were reportedly used against China in a 1969 border conflict and in Afghanistan. Since then research and development has continued and currently Russian forces field a wide array of third-generation FAE warheads.     In addition to classic FAE munitions, Soviet scientists have also developed other """"enhanced-blast"""" munitions, particularly reactive-surround and slurry-explosive blast warheads. Both types of warheads work on the same principle by which the explosive is dispersed and mixed with atmospheric oxygen before the detonation process is completed. The destruction, death, and injury are caused by the blast wave. Reactive-surround warheads are thin-walled containers filled with combustible aluminum and nitrocellulose. Slurry-explosive warheads are a mixture of a high explosive or other explosive solid mixed with a combustible liquid.     Blast Injuries     Blast explosives kill or injure in three ways: with the blast wave; with flying debris or by collapsing buildings; and by the blast wind throwing bodies against the ground, equipment, structures, and other stationary objects.     According to a 1993 study by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency:     The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique--and unpleasant.... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs.... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents.(8)     According to a separate U.S. Central Intelligence Agency study, """"the effect of an FAE explosion within confined spaces is immense. Those near the ignition point are obliterated. Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, and thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.""""(9) Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that because the """"shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue...it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate.""""(10)     Lung injuries are particularly difficult to diagnose and treat. If FAEs are used in Chechnya, this would present an additional burden on the ill-equipped and overburdened Chechen hospitals.     Known Russian FAE and Enhanced-blast Weapons     ODAB-500PM Bomb, Fuel-air-explosive-filled bomb.   KAB-500Kr-OD Bomb, TV guided fuel-air-explosive-filled bomb.   ODS-OD BLU dispenser, with ODS-OD BLU cluster bombs (8 per dispenser), Cluster bomb with fuel-air-explosive-filled cluster bomblets.   300 mm 12 tube rocket-launcher 9A52-2 (Smerch), Reactive-surround warhead on a 300 mm rocket.(11)   220 mm 16 tube rocket-launcher 9P140 (Uragan), Reactive-surround warhead on a 220 mm rocket(12)   Shturm Antitank Guided Missile, Helicopter-mounted rocket with FAE warhead.   ATAKA Antitank Guided Missile, Helicopter-mounted rocket with FAE warhead.   S-8D (S-8DM) 80 mm rocket, Aircraft-mounted rocket with FAE warhead.   S-13D 122 mm rocket, Aircraft-mounted rocket with FAE warhead.   TOS-1 220 mm Multiple Rocket Launcher System (Buratino, """"Pinocchio""""), Reportedly fires 220 mm rocket with FAE warhead.   Kornet-E Long Range Antitank Guided Missile System, with thermobaric (fuel air explosive) HE warhead, Infantry antitank rocket with FAE warhead.   RPO-A Shmel Rocket Infantry flame-thrower.

It urged British Home Secretary Jack Straw to release to interested parties the medical evaluation of the former Chilean dictator. """"Today's ruling is an unfortunate setback to principles of justice,"""" said Wilder Tayler, General Counsel for Human Rights Watch. """"Jack Straw carries a huge historical responsibility to reach a decision that is just, and that respects the rights of Pinochet's victims."""" Human Rights Watch had joined with five other organizations to seek a judicial review preventing the British home secretary from releasing Pinochet without taking certain basic steps of procedural fairness. The Belgian government had sought a similar review. The High Court in London today denied both requests. Human Rights Watch said that it would consider all available legal options following today's decision. The international human rights organization had expressed its objections on three main grounds: that the medical examination was cursory and performed by non-specialists; that the results of the medical examination have not been shared with interested parties; that there has been no public hearing on this matter of vital public interest. The five organizations joining Human Rights Watch in filing this application are Amnesty International, The Redress Trust, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Association of the Relatives of Disappeared Persons, and Justicia. Tayler noted that the growing number of countries who want Pinochet extradited shows that the principle of """"universal jurisdiction"""" is gaining wider acceptance. In addition to Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and France have also requested Pinochet's extradition. """"Pinochet's crimes were so terrible, he can be prosecuted for them anywhere,"""" said Tayler.

It called the Russian restrictions arbitrary and obstructive.  The rights organization also expressed concern about the dangers faced by journalists working in the region, and called on all parties to the conflict to respect the rights of the press. Human Rights Watch has also been denied access to Chechnya by Russian military authorities. """"Russia is keeping international and local journalists out of Chechnya through arbitrary and obstructive regulations,"""" said Jean-Paul Marthoz, European press director of Human Rights Watch. """"Journalists have a right to report on this conflict, and the obstacles placed in their path by the Russian authorities are unacceptable."""" Added Marthoz, """"by keeping journalists out, Russia is trying to hide the evidence of its brutal campaign in Chechnya from the eyes of the international community."""" Human Rights Watch strongly criticized the arrest and continued detention by Russian authorities of Andrei Babitsky, a ten-year-veteran reporter for the U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty who had been reporting from the besieged capital Grozny. Russian officials had often accused Babitsky of being pro-Chechen in his accounts. After denying for five days that they had detained Babitsky and suggesting that he may have disappeared at the hands of Chechen rebels, Russian authorities finally admitted on Friday that Babitsky was in their custody.  Babitsky is believed to be held incommunicado in the Chechen town of Urus-Martan, without access to a lawyer or his family. The Interfax agency reported that Babitsky was charged with """"taking part in an illegal armed formation,"""" but this report has not been confirmed by Russian authorities. According to Babitsky's wife Lyudmila, Russian security agents raided their Moscow apartment on January 8 and seized photos he had taken in Grozny of dead Russian soldiers.  """"Babitsky's arrest and continued detention is yet another attempt to muzzle independent coverage of the Chechnya conflict,"""" said Marthoz. """"Russia is arresting journalists for not having an accreditation which Russian authorities refuse to provide them in the first place. Babitsky must be immediately released, or Russia needs to provide some concrete evidence of wrongdoing on his part. Babitsky is a well-respected journalist and the information we have received indicates that he was simply doing his job as a journalist."""" Since the beginning of the Chechnya conflict, Russian authorities have attempted to keep international and local journalists out of Chechnya by manipulating accreditation requirements. Although Russian law clearly grants accredited journalists access to the entire Russian territory and no state of emergency has been declared in Chechnya, Russian officials have required that journalists who want to visit Chechnya obtain additional accreditation from military authorities at the Mozdok military headquarters in North Ossetia. Most international journalists have sought Mozdok accreditation without success. Only two or three international media organizations have received Mozdok accreditation after extensive lobbying efforts, while pro-Moscow journalists have been granted much greater access to Chechnya. Journalists are required to hire armed security guards when working in neighboring Ingushetia, and these armed guards have been instructed not to let journalists enter Chechnya. International journalists who enter Chechnya without the additional Mozdok accreditation have been repeatedly arrested and questioned, and have been threatened with expulsion from Russia. Russia has also attempted to manipulate coverage of the Chechnya conflict by organizing carefully managed media tours which offer a strongly pro-Moscow view of the conflict. Journalists have sometimes managed to enter Chechnya by bribing corrupt Russian officials. Russian journalists who have attempted to report critically on the Chechnya war have also faced negative consequences from the Russian authorities. When Russia's main commercial television station, NTV, aired an interview on January 23 with a Russian officer stating that Russia was suffering significant losses in Chechnya, the television station was removed from the military journalists' pool for several days in apparent retribution. In late October 1999, Anthony Loyd, a reporter for the British Sunday Times, and Tyler Hicks, an American photographer, were arrested inside Chechnya and were extensively interrogated for a period of six days by agents of the Federal Security Bureau, the successor agency to the KGB. On December 29, Russian forces detained seven international journalists near Grozny, flew them by helicopter to the Mozdok military base, and held them for nine hours before releasing them without harm. Those arrested were Daniel Williams of the Washington Post; David Filipov of the Boston Globe; Marcus Warren of The Daily Telegraph; Rodriguez Fernandez of El Pais; British photojournalist Michael Yassukovich; and Ricardo Ortega of Spanish Antenna 3 television and his cameraman Teimuraz Gabashvili. """"There is no basis in Russian law for these stringent restrictions and arbitrary arrests, and they are inconsistent with international standards,"""" said Marthoz. """" Russia is simply trying to hide the evidence of its brutal campaign in Chechnya from the eyes of the international community."""" Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the dangerous working conditions faced by journalists working in the region. Journalists have been kidnaped on numerous occasions by shadowy groups operating in the region. Brice Fleutiaux, a French freelance photographer, was kidnaped inside Chechnya on October 1, 1999, and his fate is unknown. Dmitry Balburov, a correspondent for Moscovski Novosti, was kidnaped in Nazran, the capital of Ingushetia on October 4, and was freed inside Chechnya in early January 2000. Other reporters have been kidnaped in the region, as well as other Russians and foreigners such as aid workers. """"We urge all parties to the conflict in Chechnya to respect the rights of journalists,"""" said Marthoz. """"Journalists have a right to do their job without constant harassment. Covering a war is difficult enough without constant harassment and the danger of being kidnapped.""""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/01/31/china-human-rights-update-february-2000","China Human Rights Update February 2000","China Human Rights Update (February, 2000)","","01/31/2000","Human Rights Watch urges the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, at its next annual meeting, to adopt a strong resolution censuring China for widespread violations of human rights and calling for significant improvements. A serious multilateral effort at the Commission, which convenes in Geneva on March 20, would have more than symbolic meaning. The prospect of a debate on a China resolution would give Beijing a powerful incentive to make meaningful progress to end abuses. The decreased pressure over the last few years, when there was no action in Geneva -- or, in 1999, only a last minute attempt by the U.S.-- may have contributed to the deterioration of human rights in China during the past year.   A tightening of controls on basic freedoms in China began in late 1998, escalated throughout 1999, and has continued into the new year. The range of the crackdown, in terms of geographic spread and individuals and organizations targeted, suggests that a nationally orchestrated campaign is underway to shut down all opposition in the name of maintaining """"social stability."""" The clear deterioration of human rights conditions demands a strong, multilateral response.   China's leadership has largely succeeded in convincing its major trading partners to move virtually all human rights discussions behind closed doors. The various bilateral dialogues with China, including the E.U.-China dialogue, have thus far been insufficient to encourage respect for universal human rights principles or to produce significant human rights progress. Although China has signed two important U.N. human rights treaties, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it has ratified neither and instead stepped up its repression of individuals seeking to exercise the very rights the covenants were designed to protect.   Among the most important elements of the crackdown, detailed below, are:  an intensified attack on all organizations that the Chinese Communist Party perceives as a threat to its rule; a series of regulations that constrain free association and assembly and religious expression but allow the Chinese government to claim it abides by the rule of law,  the ongoing arrest of Tibetan """"splittists"""" and tightened secular control of Tibetan Buddhism,  the stepped up pace of arrests and executions of activists in Xinjiang,  on-going attempts to interfere with the free flow of information at home and abroad including academic research in open sources.  Social Organizations and Political Parties   Three key events marked the crackdown on social organizations and political parties. In October 1998, rigorous new regulations effectively mandated that all social organizations be government-sponsored. On November 23, 1998, a statement by former premier Li Peng effectively banned opposition political parties. In July 1999 the Falun Gong, a meditation and exercise movement, which had been applying without success to register as a social organization, was formally banned.   China Democracy Party   In December 1998, the courts sentenced three leading members of the China Democracy Party (CDP), an open opposition party, to terms of eleven, twelve, and thirteen years for """"conspiring to subvert state power."""" Charges included: helping to organize the CDP, receiving funds from abroad, promoting independent trade unions, using e-mail to distribute materials abroad, and giving interviews to foreign correspondents. The government's attempts, largely successful, to destroy the banned organization, resulted in long prison terms for CDP members in Beijing, Shanghai, and at least eight other provinces. In all some twenty-five members have been sentenced since December 1998 to trials lacking adequate procedural safeguards and closed in all but name; three have been tried but not yet sentenced; and at least another dozen are still in detention.   Other organizational attempts stifled:   In addition to the CDP, Chinese authorities quashed the China Development Union, whose interests encompassed political and environmental reform; in February 1999, its leader, Peng Ming, was sentenced to an eighteen-month term for allegedly soliciting prostitution.   Throughout China, leaders of worker and peasant protests calling for worker rights have been detained. Also, those trying to organize workers, or protesting against exorbitant fees and taxes, endemic corruption or fixed local elections have been arrested and given sentences of up to ten years. In Chongqing, the procuracy approved the arrest of ten peasant leaders of the Southwestern Yangtse Chinese People's Workers and Farmers Army, illegal because it never registered. In Henan province in November 1999, An Jun, founder of Corruption Watch, an NGO, stood trial. In Shandong province, an attempt to organize the China National Freedom Party , modeled on the CDP, resulted in a series of detentions.   The Chinese authorities also moved aggressively against Jiang Qisheng for his activism in organizing the families of those killed and wounded in the 1989 pro-democracy crackdown, for which Chinese authorities have failed to account. His May 1999 call to the public to commemorate the event by lighting candles resulted in a trial on November 1 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government To date, no verdict has been announced.   Falun Gong   In a speech on January 17, 2000, the head of the politics and law committee of the China's Central Committee made clear that the crackdown on Falun Gong which began on July 22, 1999 would continue throughout the year. China's leaders unveiled a massive, thoroughly coordinated crackdown against the loosely organized meditation and exercise organization. (group size is estimated to run between two and seventy million in China alone) three months after ten thousand members of Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) silently protested at Zhongnanhai, the Beijing compound housing China's top leaders. Initially a series of bans and new regulations outlawed the group; police detained thousands of practitioners for reeducation, most of whom have since been released. Millions of books were confiscated and destroyed.   On October 9, 1999 the government issued two explanations"""" of existing law that in effect encouraged harsh punishment of members of """"heretical cults."""" On October 27, Xinhua, the official news agency, published evidence """"proving"""" that Falun Gong was such an organization. Three days later, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) banned all such groups. The strategy allowed the government to claim that the intensifying censorship and crackdown on practitioners was legal. A """"black list"""" of Falun Gong practitioners unwelcome in China reportedly has been drawn up. In addition, a clandestine press conference on October 28, 1999 with a limited number of foreign journalists resulted in the arrest of Falun Gong participants and the temporary confiscation of the journalists' credentials, followed by warnings that another such incident could result in their permanent withdrawal. On December 10, the official press reported that Beijing had leveled a fine of US$1.2 million against Falun Gong and its leader Li Hongzhi, a New York city resident, for alleged tax evasion.   On November 8, China's State Council, its cabinet, confirmed the formal arrest of at least 111 Falun Gong members, the first time any number had been officially announced. The number later was reported as 150. Few details, even names and place of arrest, are known. To date, officially confirmed sentences for thirteen people in Beijing and three provinces range between three and eighteen years, with most terms in excess of six years. Charges include setting up and using an illegal organization to print material, escaping from custody, """"using a sect to destroy the implementation of the law,"""" using the Internet to promote Falun Gong's health benefits, leaking an official speech, and helping to organize illegal gatherings. At least six others in three more locations reportedly have been tried but no verdicts have been announced. In addition, charges have been levied against at least eleven Falun Gong members for allegedly leaking state secrets through use of the Internet, and many others are being held in connection with publishing activities.   Falun Gong and government sources have disputed the number of people administratively sentenced for offenses such as allegedly gathering illegally to disturb social order, spreading anti-government propaganda, illegal publishing and stealing state secrets, and carrying out """"illegal link-up activities."""" The authorities say they are not collecting figures nationwide and reports from various localities cannot be confirmed. However, a report citing a speech by vice-premier Li Lanqing said 35,792 Falun Gong members were detained between July 20 and October 30. Most detainees reportedly were released after brief """"reeducation."""" An official with the news agency of the State Council said the figures represented """"the total number of times individuals who attempted to assemble illegally in public places in Beijing since July were persuaded to leave or were taken away from the site."""" A police official did confirm a report that fifty Falun Gong members, reportedly repeat offenders, have been held in a psychiatric hospital near Beijing since December.   Falun Gong members have reported at least seven deaths, including one from an interrogation-related beating, several suicides, and several escape attempts. Chinese officials report three, two from heart attacks, including the one Falun Gong members maintain was from a beating, and one from jumping from a train in an escape attempt. Those who reported the beating death reportedly have been charged with disclosing the information to foreign sources.   Freedom of religion and belief   In early January 2000, two Communist Party officials, Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councillor Ismail Amat, speaking to an assemblage of government religious officials, reiterated the importance of control of religion to the stability of the state and of resistance to """"hostile foreign forces"""" which they allege use religion to undermine China's solidarity.   There have been sporadic reports of arrests and detentions of Catholics and Protestants throughout the year. A January 23, 2000 report carried news of the December detentions of Bishop Han Dingxiang and lay leader Wang Changqun, the arrests during Easter 1999 of Fathers Guo Yibao and Wang Zhenhe, and the detention of Father Xie Guolin sometime in 1999. Campaigns to register Catholic congregations in Hebei and Zhejiang forced many worshipers into hiding. In a further attempt to reaffirm the independence from the papacy of the official Catholic Church in China, the secular Religious Affairs Bureau and the Bishops' Conference of the Catholic Church in China arranged the January 6, 2000 ordination of five bishops without seeking papal approval. The move signaled continued government interference in religious affairs.   At least ninety-five Protestant house church leaders were detained early in 1999. In May, three students from China's most prestigious seminary were forced to leave for challenging the government's religious policy. Mid-November witnessed the beginnings of a crackdown on so-called syncretic congregations which combine Christianity with local religious practices. In November 1999 alone, over one hundred members of the latter groups were detained.   In January 2000, Chen Jinlong, head of Zhong Gong. a form of qigong, was sentenced to a two-year term for illegal healing. The move followed the police closure of his largest training base. The leader of Guo Gong and two of his aides were detained in late October, as was the head of the Cibei Gong. There have been reports of several official documents laying out new methods for extending the crackdown and keeping qigong groups small, localized, and limited in their activities.   Freedom of expression   During 1999, Chinese authorities continued to impede the free exchange of information no matter the medium. The on-going campaign to control the Internet picked up in January with new regulations requiring bars and cafes with Internet access to register and inform the police about their customers. By May, the Ministry of State Security was able to track individual e-mail accounts through monitoring devices on Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In addition, in an attempt to block foreign news services such as the BBC, CNN, and the New York Times, ISPs were required to erect firewalls. Bulletin boards came in for round-the-clock monitoring; several were closed for hosting political discussions or postings critical of government policies. To avoid such closure, chat rooms and bulletin boards actively police their own content. In January 2000, Shanghai took the lead in requiring corporate Internet users to register with the police. Fines for non-compliance were set as high as 50,000 renminbi (approximately U.S.$6175). On January 26, 2000, regulations retroactive to the first of the year forbade the transmittal of state secrets on the Web or through e-mail. The restrictions make both users and Web site owners liable for infractions. The broad language of the state secrets law invites selective application against anyone out of favor with the government. In addition, it has been reported that soon-to-be-introduced regulations will no longer allow websites to independently compile news or interview reporters. Instead, the websites may only carry news already compiled by domestic papers.   Lin Hai was sentenced in 1999 to a two-year prison term for supplying some 30,000 e-mail addresses to an overseas dissident publication. One report, still unconfirmed, stated that he has been released.   The publishing and print media also came in for tighter supervision. A campaign that began in January 1999 continued into January 2000 when a senior official warned local journalists to limit their investigative reporting, and vice-premier Hu Jintao warned the media to adhere to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) line. At the same time, twenty-seven newspaper were punished for offenses such as """"political errors"""" in their stories, and in January 2000, the editor of Nanfang Zhoumou (Southern Weekend) was removed from her job. The newspaper is well-known throughout China for its reporting on politically sensitive issues. Two major stories, a huge corruption scandal in Xiamen and the flight of the Karmapa to India, went unreported in the official press though leaks were plentiful. In September, local newspapers and magazines were put under CCP control. In November, it was reported that the State Press and Publications Administration had banned foreign investment in wholesale book publication and distribution. It required local ventures to apply for authorization to operate in the wholesale market; and limited the right to distribute textbooks, political documents, and the writings of China's leaders to a handful of enterprises.   At the end of 1999, the formal arrest in China of Song Yongyi, a respected scholar of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and a permanent U.S. resident, on charges of """"the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreigners,"""" set off alarm bells. Although he was released on January 28, 2000, his arbitrary arrest and detention testify to the capriciousness of """"rule of law"""" in China and the dangers of conducting research into """"sensitive"""" subjects even in sources freely available within China. Earlier in 1999, Liu Xianli was sentenced to a four-year term for trying to publish a work about well-known Chinese dissidents. Survey research also came in for censorship.   Freedom of association and assembly  New regulations issued on November 24 require that every gathering of 200 or more people obtain prior approval from a local Public Security Bureau. An additional step is required for non-government affiliated organizers who must first receive approval from the relevant government department. Specifically cited as affected were sports events, concerts, and qigong or other body exercise groups.   Tibet  Human rights abuses in Tibet in 1999 remained serious. There were credible reports of:  detentions and sentencings for pro-independence activities which included  - shouting slogans,  - putting up posters,  - displaying the banned Tibetan flag; beatings and torture, some so severe that the prisoners died;  government interference with religious activity including   - reeducation of monks and nuns,  - forced expulsions from monasteries of non-compliant members,  - secular selection of the reincarnation of Reting Rinpoche,  - bans on the celebration of religious festivals and the Dalai Lama's birthday,  - arrests for carrying or distributing pictures of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama,  - banning of religious teaching on pain of arrest,  - denial of access to the ten-year-old boy the Dalai Lama recognized as the Panchen Lama-he disappeared in 1995.  Only late in 1999 did the details emerge of the deaths and severe torture of prisoners involved in a peaceful prison protest during a flag-raising ceremony at Drapchi prison in May 1998, at the time of a European Union delegation visit. The delay resulted from steps Chinese authorities took to prevent details about the incident from spreading. At least ten people died; at least six others had their sentences extended; many prisoners were confined to their cells for over a year without access to minimum sanitation.   Other major abuses of human rights occurred in the past year. In August, two foreigners and their Tibetan translator, Tsering Dorje, were detained for trying to independently assess the reaction of affected Tibetans to a World Bank proposal to move Han Chinese and Hui Muslims into a traditionally Tibetan-Mongolian area. Both foreigners were deported. Tsering Dorje was allowed to return to his studies. However, Chinese officials denied permission for the World Bank inspection panel to visit him. That same month, Tashi Tsering, who lowered the Chinese flag in Potala Square during the National Minority Games, was brutally beaten as he was being detained. His whereabouts and physical condition are still unknown. An orphanage where he had done some construction work has been shut and family members and orphanage staff have been detained.   In October 1999, hundreds of people (some reports said as many as 3,000) in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, protested the arrests of Sonam Phuntsog, a prominent scholar and teacher seemingly loyal to the Dalai Lama, and two other monks, Agyal Tsering and Sonam Choephel. There were reports that some eighty people were detained after troops fired into the air to disperse the crowd, but that many, if not most, have since been released. Strong security measures have been put in place at the monastery.   In January 2000, the Dalai Lama rejected as unauthentic the two-year-old child ordained as the reincarnation of Reting Rinpoche. The government, in defending its action, insisted that """"any installation not ratified by the central government is considered illegal."""" The issue is important in that Reting Rinpoche could become regent after the death of the present Dalai Lama and while the new Dalai Lama is a minor. The chairman of the Tibet government has said the child will receive a """"patriotic"""" education under the guidance of the state, and government religious functionaries will make certain the child """"loves the Communist Party of China, the socialist country and Tibetan Buddhism."""" The ordination followed the flight to India of the fourteen-year-old Karmapa, head of one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the most significant Buddhist figure remaining in China. Although recognized by the Dalai Lama, the Chinese leadership thought the Karmapa loyal to the regime and a check on those who oppose it. Tsurphu monastery, where he resided, was secured as soon as his flight became known and several monks reportedly were detained. All Voice of Tibet broadcasts experienced severe jamming. It is believed Chinese authorities, who accused the Dalai Lama of complicity in the youth's escape, are negotiating for his return from India.   Of some 600 Tibetan political prisoners, 80 percent are monks or nuns. One-tenth of the 600 are serving sentences of ten or more years. There have been numerous reports of torture; the consequences of only a few are known. A monk, Legshe Tsoglam, died in April 1999, several days after his release from Gutsa Detention Center. He had been detained for resisting reeducation.   Xinjiang   Throughout the year, authorities in Xinjiang reacted with draconian measures to an alleged terrorist campaign by """"splittist"""" elements. The pace of executions increased, as did public sentencing rallies, and lengthy prison terms for suspected splittists. Courts in Aksu prefecture, the No. 4 Production and Construction Brigade, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Urumqi, and Nonshishi, are known to have handed down sentences ranging between a year's incarceration and the death penalty. In many cases, those charged had no access to counsel, nor were family members notified of the proceedings. The government, certain that mosques and religious schools harbored dissidents, tightened control of the institutions' leadership, curricula, and teaching materials. During a campaign begun toward the end of 1999, six imams from Hotan city and Karakash county were detained, in part for non-compliance with religious regulations and for failing to teach government policy at religious meetings.   In January, in Urumqi city, Xinjiang's capital, Rebiya Kadeer, a prominent and much loved Uighur businesswoman best known for her work in fostering development in Xinjiang and for her 1000 Families Mothers Project, which helped Uighur women to develop their own businesses, was still awaiting trial for sending information overseas. This despite the fact that on December 3, the Urumqi City Intermediate Court informed her lawyers that the case had been returned to the procuracy for lack of evidence. However, two others detained with her on August 11, 1999, her son, Ablikim Abdyirim, and her secretary, Kahriman Abdukirim, were sent to Wulabai Reeducation Through Labor School on November 20 to serve two- and three-year terms respectively. The charges against them have not been reported. Kadeer's work had been supported by the government until members of her family migrated to the U.S. to join her husband, Sidik Rouzi, a political dissident who regularly broadcasts on Radio Free Asia. Family members have consistently maintained, as did Ms. Kadeer before her arrest, that she was never involved in dissident activity.","Asia, China and Tibet","Free Speech, Religious Freedom"

Habre has lived in Senegal since he was deposed in December 1990 by current president Idriss Deby. """"Hissein Habre is Africa's Pinochet,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"By bringing him to justice, Senegal can take an historic step towards ending the cycle of impunity that has plagued the continent.""""

Nine individual Chadians are named as private plaintiffs, as is the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime which represents 792 victims of Habre's brutality. """"This is the first case of African victims asking the court of another African country to prosecute a former African dictator,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"This prosecution cannot only provide some justice to Habre's thousands of victims, but help put an end to the routine practice of the worst tyrants to move into comfortable exile next door."""" Joining Human Rights Watch in today's actions were RADDHO, the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, the Chadian League for Human Rights (LTDH), the National Organization for Human Rights (Senegal), the London-based Interights, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) and the French organization Agir Ensemble. Habre, now 57 years old, took power in the former French colony of Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye. Habre's one-party regime was marked by widespread abuse. He periodically targeted various ethnic groups such as the Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989) killing and arresting members en masse under the pretext that they posed a threat to the regime. Just before Habre fled in 1990, his Presidential Guard allegedly killed more than 300 political prisoners who had been secretly detained at the President's headquarters in the capital, N'Djamena. The exact number of Habre's victims is not known. A truth commission established by the Deby government accused Habre's government of 40,000 political murders and 200,000 cases of torture. Most were carried out by his dreaded secret police, the National Security Service (Direction de la Documentation et de la Sécurité - DDS) composed of 8,000 agents. The truth commission also accused Habre of taking some seven billion CFA francs (11.6 million dollars) with him when he fled to Senegal. In 1998, Chad's then Justice Minister Limane Mahamat said that Chad would seek Habre's extradition from Senegal, but no formal request was made. Chad did institute a successful lawsuit in Senegal to recover the airplane in which Habre fled. The United States and France supported Habre throughout his rule, seeing him as a bulwark against Libya's Moemmar Khadaffi. Under President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. gave covert CIA paramilitary support to help Habre take power in order, according to Secretary of State Alexander Haig, to """"bloody Khadaffi's nose."""" The U.S later provided Habre with tens of millions of dollars per year as well as military intelligence information. The organizations presented the sworn testimony of two former prisoners who were ordered by the DDS to dig mass graves to bury Habre's opponents. In addition to those killed, many prisoners died of starvation, malaria or dysentery. Torture was widespread in Habre's detention centers. One frequent method, suffered by two of the plaintiffs in today's action, was the """"Arbatachar,"""" in which a prisoner's four limbs were tied together behind his back, leading to loss of circulation and paralysis. Prisoners were also subject to electric shocks, drownings and beatings. In their court papers, the groups cited Senegal's obligations under international law to prosecute those accused of crimes against humanity. It also invoked the Senegalese statute on torture as well as the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1987 and which obliges states to either prosecute or extradite alleged torturers who enter its territory. This Convention was the basis for Britain's detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Human Rights Watch took part in the Pinochet case in Britain's House of Lords and has since campaigned to bring other former tyrants to justice. Among other human rights criminals now in exile, the group cited Uganda's Idi Amin currently living in Saudi Arabia, Haiti's Raul Cedras in Panama, Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner in Brazil and Haiti's death squad leader Emmanuel """"Toto"""" Constant in the United States. When Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who has lived in Zimbabwe since 1991, visited South Africa in November 1999 for medical treatment Human Rights Watch campaigned unsuccessfully for his arrest. The Habre investigation began when the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights requested Human Rights Watch's assistance. Two lawyers with the Harvard Law School Human Rights Program visited Chad in July-August 1999 to gather evidence. In November-December 1999, Human Rights Watch consultant Pascale Kambale and RADDHO director Alioune Tine returned to Chad to finish the investigation and arrange today's criminal complaint, which was prepared with the assistance of the FIDH.","Africa, Chad",""

""""The Council of Europe's top priority must be getting a sustained international monitoring presence in Ingushetia,"""" said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's representative in the northern Caucasus, who traveled to Strasbourg to press his case with members of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly holding their quarterly meeting this week. """"Having people from the international community on the ground to bear witness to what is happening is the best means of getting some immediate relief. If the Russian Federation is serious about living up to its commitments to the Council of Europe, it must agree to such scrutiny."""" In an open letter to Parliamentary Assembly members, Human Rights Watch urged the parliamentarians to throw their weight behind an international monitoring mission in Ingushetia. The rights group also pressed for: suspension of Russia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly; the filing of a complaint against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights; and the initiation of an inquiry into violations of Russia's Council of Europe commitments. A copy of the Human Rights Watch letter calling for an inquiry into Russia's conduct in the war is available below. Human Rights Watch monitors in Ingushetia have interviewed hundreds of civilians fleeing the fighting in neighboring Chechnya. Their findings include several incidents of indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing of civilian targets by Russian forces. In Russian-controlled territory troops have also engaged in widespread looting, abuse of civilians, and, in some instances, summary executions and rape. Soldiers manning border posts have become notorious for extorting bribes from both those fleeing the conflict and those seeking to return to their homes. For their part, Chechen rebels have repeatedly beaten and threatened civilians, and endangered them by taking up military positions in heavily populated areas. January 21, 2000 Re: Urgent Debate on Chechnya Dear Members of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly: As you convene in Strasbourg for your January session, we write to convey the results of our on-going monitoring of the conflict in Chechnya. We hope that you will take advantage of the urgent debate to express your unequivocal condemnation of the abuses being committed in Chechnya and to signal that continued violations will have serious consequences for Russian relations with the Council of Europe and its member states. Human Rights Watch, a privately funded international human rights monitoring organization, has since mid-October maintained a staff presence in Ingushetia, where we have taken the testimony of hundreds of displaced persons from Chechnya. As summarized in the attached memorandum, we now have substantial evidence of serious violations of international humanitarian law being committed by the Russian forces. We have documented several incidents of disproportionate and indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets, including the apparently deliberate bombing of columns of refugees fleeing Chechnya. Soldiers manning border posts have become notorious for extorting bribes from both those fleeing the conflict and those seeking to return to their homes. Once Russian forces establish control over population centers, soldiers apparently have carte blanche to strip homes of household goods and valuables; many people have returned briefly to their homes to find them looted bare. In the village of Alkhan-Yurt, soldiers who occupied the town went on a rampage, not only looting but also summarily executing at least fourteen residents who tried to stop them.  Meanwhile, the Russian authorities have grossly neglected the needs of displaced persons in Ingushetia and in December began pressing them to return to Chechnya by cutting their food rations. For their part, Chechen rebels have repeatedly beaten and threatened civilians who attempted to spare their villages from Russian bombardment. They have also endangered civilians by taking positions in areas heavily populated by civilians, from which they have then fired on Russian aircraft. We have welcomed the role that the Council of Europe Commissioner on Human Rights, Secretary General and Parliamentary Assembly have taken in condemning these abuses and urging the parties to the conflict to abide by their international commitments. We trust that the Parliamentary Assembly will continue on this course this week and encourage you to include the following points in any recommendation or resolution that you adopt: Establish a sustained and substantial international monitoring presence in Ingushetia. It is our view that your highest priority must be securing access to Ingushetia for an international monitoring presence and that this should be a key subject of your discussions with your Russian counterparts, as well as your primary recommendation to the Committee of Ministers. While the periodic visits to the region by Council of Europe officials have made an important contribution, it is our view that only under such on-going scrutiny can the international community hope to see the parties to the conflict abide by international law. The monitoring mission should have a mandate that includes, among other things: gathering information on humanitarian and human rights problems from all sources, including displaced persons, the Russian authorities, and Ingush authorities; gathering information about access to humanitarian assistance and protection for internally displaced persons in Ingushetia and in Chechnya; engaging the Russian authorities directly in cases of violations or threats thereof; observing daily all checkpoints on the main """"humanitarian corridors"""" out of Chechnya; supporting the relief effort in the Northern Caucasus; making frequent trips, security conditions permitting, to Chechnya; pressing for access to Chechnya for non-governmental organizations that seek it; and issuing periodic, public reports of its findings. In keeping with its preeminent expertise in the field of human rights, as well as the program of the current chair of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Europe could play a significant role in establishing such a mission. Call on the Committee of Ministers to undertake a special monitoring procedure with respect to developments in Chechnya. In accordance with the Committee of Ministers' 1994 Declaration on compliance with Commitments Accepted by Member States of the Council of Europe (adopted 10 November 1994), the Parliamentary Assembly should call on the Committee of Ministers to investigate the Russian Federation's compliance with its Council of Europe commitments in the context of the conflict in Chechnya. Call on member states to initiate interstate proceedings against the Russian Federation before the European Court on Human Rights. The Russian government's activities in Chechnya are in clear violation of several provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which envisions interstate complaints as an essential collective enforcement mechanism. As signatories to the Convention bound to uphold and enforce its provisions throughout the Council of Europe region, member states are obligated to bring and interstate complaint in the face of such egregious and systematic violations. The Parliamentary Assembly should call on member states to initiate such proceedings as a matter of urgency. Human Rights Watch is prepared to provide documentation to help establish a prima facie case before the Court. Suspend the credentials of the delegation of the Russian Federation. In its December debate on Chechnya, the Bureau concluded that """"persistence in violations could lead the Parliamentary Assembly to put under question Russian participation in the Assembly's work and in the Council of Europe in general."""" That warning was met with defiance by the Russian Federation: first came the issuance of a barbaric ultimatum that the people of Grozny flee or face """"destruction,"""" followed by the pressuring of displaced persons in Ingushetia to return to the war zone and most recently a declaration that men aged ten to sixty would be barred from crossing the Chechen border. The Parliamentary Assembly must in the face of these escalating abuses follow through on its December warning and suspend the credentials of the Russian parliamentary delegation. We hope that the attached summary of conditions in the Northern Caucasus provides a useful reference as you engage in your important deliberations this week. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance.

The January 22 ruling is the latest in a series of cases brought by Kuwaiti Islamists against journalists, commentators, and academics for expressing controversial views on religious and political themes.  """"Kuwait used to be an island of relative openness in the Middle East,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"This ruling marks yet another major setback to freedom of expression in Kuwait and in the region."""" The court sentenced Kuwait University professor of philosophy Dr. `Aliya Shu`ayb; her publisher, Yahia al-Rubay`an; and Laila al-`Othman, a novelist, to two months in prison for writings that the court said """"included expressions that violate God, and indecent and shameless expressions."""" The ruling did not specify what those expressions were. In an interview in al-Hayat newspaper on Sunday, Shu`ayb said that she had obtained affidavits from professors of Islamic Law attesting that her poem did not touch on religion, but the court ignored the affidavits.  In addition to the prison sentences, Shu`ayb and al-Rubay`an were each fined 100 Dinar for publishing and distributing Shu`ayb's book of poetry, Spiders Bemoan a Wound, without a permit. All three have appealed the ruling and are out on bail. An appeal court is expected to hear the case in February.  Kuwait University professor Dr. Ahmad al-Baghdadi was sentenced to one month in prison in a similar case in October 1999. The court found that his article in a student newspaper defamed Islam by contending that the prophet Mohammed had failed to convert non-believers during his time in Mecca. He was later pardoned due to poor health. Other rulings in 1999 have resulted in journalists being fined and publication of their magazines and newspapers ordered suspended.  Kuwait's Press and Publications Law makes it a criminal offense to publish materials that violate """"by allusion, slander, sarcasm, or disparagement, God or the prophets or the companions of the prophet Mohammad,"""" or """"sully public morals."""" A similarly vague article in the Criminal Code mandates prison sentences for the dissemination of """"opinions that include sarcasm, contempt, or belittling of religion or a religious school of thought.""""

The application seeks an independent examination of the medical basis for any decision regarding the former Chilean dictator's fitness to stand trial. Home Secretary Jack Straw had been expected to announce his decision in the next few days. """"A matter of such tremendous importance deserves more than just a rushed, closed-door decision,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"If Secretary Straw does not permit public, adversarial proceedings, we hope the courts will order such a hearing."""" Human Rights Watch objects on three main grounds to the procedure used so far to assess Pinochet's fitness to stand trial: § First, the medical examination was cursory and performed by non-specialists. There was no old-age psychiatrist among the doctors examining Pinochet. The examination consisted of a one-shot evaluation in hospital conditions rather than an assessment over time in Pinochet's temporary home. Two of the four doctors did not even speak Spanish. Under these conditions, the examining doctors could easily have misread temporary medical conditions, such as depression or medication-induced effects, as permanent. § Second, the results of the medical examination have not been shared with interested parties, including the four governments who have sought Pinochet's extradition - Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland. This secrecy has precluded those who represent the interests of Pinochet's victims from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for concluding that Pinochet is unfit to stand trial. In British criminal prosecutions, a determination of fitness to stand trial is ordinarily made after an adversarial proceeding in which interested parties are given access to the relevant evidence and an opportunity to challenge it. § Third, there has been no public hearing on this matter of vital public interest. Of particular concern is whether the evidence shows not merely that Pinochet is a sick, old man - a fate to which many of Pinochet's victims would have gladly aspired - but, as British law requires, that he is incapable of understanding the proceedings against him and of assisting in his own defense.

After six years of negotiations, governments agreed today in Geneva on a treaty establishing eighteen as the minimum age for participation in armed conflicts.  In a major policy shift, the United States agreed for the first time to end the deployment of minors into combat. During previous negotiations, the US had vigorously opposed the eighteen year age minimum. """"This treaty could really make a difference to hundreds of thousands of children around the world,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"For the first time, governments have agreed that the use of children in war is simply unacceptable."""" The organization also noted that the accord marks the first time the United States has ever agreed to change its practices in order to support a human rights standard. In other cases, notably the Landmine Ban Treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other human rights treaties, the US has either refused to ratify, or has entered reservations to exempt the US from any requirements that exceed US law.  The US armed forces currently accept seventeen-year-old volunteers with parental permission. In recent years, it has deployed 17-year-old troops to conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and the Gulf war. However, there are fewer than 3,000 seventeen-year-olds serving among the 1.2 million US active duty force. By establishing eighteen as the minimum age for participation in armed conflict, the new treaty corrects an anomaly in international law regarding children's rights. Although the Convention on the Rights of the Child firmly establishes eighteen as the dividing line between childhood and adulthood, existing standards have allowed children to be legally recruited and sent into combat at age fifteen. Human Rights Watch also noted that the eighteen-year minimum offers greater protection to younger children currently recruited by armed groups, particularly in areas where birth or age documentation is not readily available, and younger children are frequently deemed eligible for military service based on appearance alone. The accord takes the form of an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention has been ratified by every country except the United States and the collapsed state of Somalia. However, a special agreement was reached to insert language allowing any country to ratify the protocol, regardless of whether it has ratified the Convention itself. """"Many concessions were made to accommodate the United States,"""" said Becker. """"The US should now move quickly to ratify and implement the agreement."""" The organization also urged ratification of the underlying Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition to banning children under the age of eighteen from direct participation in armed conflict, the protocol sets eighteen as the minimum age for compulsory recruitment and prohibits rebel and other non-governmental armed groups from recruiting children under the age of eighteen or using them in hostilities. It also requires states to cooperate in the demobilization of child soldiers, and to assist in their rehabilitation and reintegration. Human Rights Watch stated that the primary weakness of the protocol was its failure to establish eighteen as the minimum age for voluntary recruitment. Although recognizing that children under age eighteen are entitled to special protections, the text allows states to recruit volunteers as young as sixteen. Based on research in conflict areas, the organization has concluded that the most effective way of preventing the use of children in armed conflicts is to ensure that they are not recruited. An estimated 300,000 children under the age of eighteen are currently participating in armed conflicts around the world. Human Rights Watch has investigated the use of children as soldiers in countries such as Uganda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Angola, Liberia and Lebanon. It has documented the use of children on the front lines of combat, as well as their use as porters, spies, guides, and in the case of many girls, as sexual slaves to military commanders. Human Rights Watch chairs the international Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which was formed in 1998 specifically to campaign for a ban on the use of child soldiers.","United States, Global","Children's Rights"

In the letter, Human Rights Watch charged that the arrests have further eroded the credibility of Malaysia's legal system, and said this latest crackdown bodes """"ill for long-term stability in Malaysia."""" The international human rights organization protested the arrests, which took place in the past week, of Karpal Singh, a well known defense lawyer; Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor, a leader of the National Justice Party founded by Anwar Ibrahim's wife, Dr. Wan Azizah; Marina Yusoff, vice-president of the National Justice Party; Zulkifli Suong, editor of the Islamic party newpaper Harakah; and Chia Lim Thye, owner of the paper's printing company. Human Rights Watch criticized Malaysia's use of the sedition law --under which four of the five arrested were charged -- and pointed out that these are the latest in a long series of legal cases against Malaysian citizens expressing views critical of the government. Such expression is a basic right guaranteed by international law. The text of the letter follows: January 19, 2000 Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad Prime Minister's Department Jabatan Perdana Menteri Jalan Dato Onn 50502 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Dear Prime Minister Mahathir: We are writing to express our grave concern over the recent spate of arrests of prominent government critics in Malaysia. These arrests have further eroded the credibility of the Malaysian legal system. Among those arrested in the past week were Karpal Singh, one of Malaysia's most prominent defense attorneys; Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor, a leader of the National Justice Party, founded by Anwar Ibrahim's wife Dr. Wan Azizah; Marina Yusoff, vice-president of the National Justice Party; Zulkifli Sulong, editor of the Islamic party newspaper Harakah; and Chia Lim Thye, owner of the newspaper's printing company. All five were arrested based on statements or allegations they made or printed in the run-up to nationwide elections last November. Four of the five arrested were charged with violating Malaysia's sedition law. The sedition law, originally enacted by British colonial authorities, limits free expression by broadly criminalizing any speech which is judged to have a """"seditious tendency,"""" including speech which tends """"to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against"""" the government or which tends to promote """"feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races."""" The vague language invites selective application. In 1998 the law was used to jail outspoken opposition parliamentarian Lim Guan Eng, to investigate Anwar, and to question Wan Azizah. It is ironic that your government, which has been so critical of the """"neocolonial"""" behavior of other nations, should enforce a colonial-era law against its critics.  Deputy Prime Minister Badawi has publicly stated that the arrests stemmed from """"investigations following police reports filed by several people"""" and has denied any intention to single out opposition leaders. He has claimed that the government is simply enforcing the law and thereby upholding freedom. The Deputy Prime Minister's statements, however, do not explain why, when numerous police reports were also filed against ruling party officials and their allies during this same post-election period, only opposition figures are being arrested.  The recent arrests are the latest in a series of legal cases against Malaysian citizens who openly express critical views. Prominent cases currently pending include that of women's rights activist Irene Fernandez and that of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, both of whom are in the middle of protracted, expensive trials. Selective prosecution of critics violates their basic rights as guaranteed by international law. We believe that the recent arrests, by further polarizing the political field, bode ill for long-term political stability in Malaysia. We call on you as chief executive to insure that the law in Malaysia is not used for politically motivated proceedings against activists, attorneys, journalists, and opposition leaders. Those who peacefully express critical views should not be subject to arrest. Thank you for your consideration of these important matters. We look forward to your reply.

A team of Human Rights Watch investigators in Ingushetia has spoken to a number of Chechen refugees who saw the bodies of victims, or had conversations with women who had been raped. """"Rape is a war crime, and these allegations about rape in Chechnya are very serious,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. She stressed that according to international law, any single rape could be a war crime. According to """"Malika"""" (not her real name), on December 19, 1999, Russian soldiers raped and killed her neighbor, twenty-three-year-old """"Fira"""" (not her real name). They were both residents of the Chechen town of Shali. Malika described Fira as """"very beautiful,"""" and five or six months pregnant. She said the soldiers also killed Fira's mother-in- law, """"Rozet"""" (not her real name), aged about sixty, during the same incident. According to Malika, she and other neighbors heard screams, cries, and gunshots coming from the house before discovering the bodies. Human Rights Watch has the family names of the victims and witnesses, but is withholding them on Malika's request. Malika participated in the washing of the bodies before burial (a Muslim rite), and described the condition of the pregnant Fira: On her breasts, there were dark blue bruises. There was a strangely square bruise on her shoulder. Near her liver, there were also dark bruises. On her neck, there were teeth marks, and her lips also had teeth marks, like someone had bitten her. She had a little [bullet] hole on the right side of her head, and a big wound on the left side of her head. The Chechen villagers who buried Fira's body were not able to conduct a forensic examination of the victim, but the location and nature of her wounds strongly suggested an act of sexual violence. Rozet, the mother-in-law, had gunshot wounds in her chest. Human Rights Watch has received similar allegations of rape from the village of Alkhan-Yurt, which was the scene of summary executions, looting, and other serious abuses by Russian soldiers in mid-December (See, Human Rights Watch letter to Prime Minister Putin, December 28, 1999). """"Zeinap"""" (not her real name), a thirty-two-year-old woman from Alkhan-Yurt, provided Human Rights Watch with the names of two women who had told her that they were raped by Russian soldiers in early December. One of the women was twenty-five and married, while the other was an unmarried twenty-year-old woman whom Zeinap knew well. According to Zeinap, relatives were planning to send the younger woman to Kazakhstan after the rape for treatment. Zeinap said that soldiers were frequently drunk and asked the villagers for vodka and young women, saying, """"We have not been with a woman for a long time, we need a woman."""" She said that it is possible that more cases of rape occurred but that """"even if it's true, people will not speak about it."""" A second woman from Alkhan-Yurt interviewed independently by Human Rights Watch provided a similar account of cases of rape in Alkhan-Yurt. """"Zaman"""" (not her real name), aged fifty-five, believed that five or six women had been raped, """"including one old woman like me. At night at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., the soldiers came into the cellar. Some soldiers would stand guard, aiming their guns at [the people in the cellar] while the others were raping."""" She said that many people refused to discuss the issue of rape: """"A lot of women were raped, but our people won't talk about it--these women have to marry."""" Zaman broke out in tears as she described the extreme precautions she and her neighbors had to take to protect their young daughters from rape: There were five young women with us in the cellar: my three daughters aged twenty-six, twenty, and twelve, and our neighbor's girls, aged eighteen and nineteen. We made a pit outside in the yard near the stables. We put a pipe [for air] in the pit, covered it with earth, and the five girls were staying in that pit. The soldiers used to come by and say, """"Where are the young girls, we need three girls for each soldier."""" So we kept the girls in the pit. The girls were kept there for several days. A third witness from Alkhan-Yurt, forty-year-old """"Sultan"""" (not his real name), also told Human Rights Watch about a case of rape: """"Seven contract soldiers [non-officers who serve in the military on a contractual basis] raped a woman in our village. It is a savagery. Her family lives near the cemetery; there were few people left in that part of the village. They [the soldiers] pulled her husband out in the street, and then raped her. The woman is not young, she is forty-two or forty-three. I know the woman's name, but it is against our traditions to name her."""" Reports of rape have emerged despite the strong taboo in Chechen culture against revealing instances of sexual assault. Chechnya's Muslim culture and national traditions strictly regulate relations between men and women, and inappropriate behavior is subject to severe and often violent sanctions. Unmarried women who have been raped are unlikely to be able to get married, and married women who are raped are likely to be divorced by their husbands. These factors make it difficult to document cases or rape and sexual abuse in Chechnya, and make it likely that rapes in Chechnya are under-reported. """"Women who are raped suffer severe consequences within Chechen culture, in addition to the mental and physical trauma of the rape experience itself,"""" said Ms. Ralph. """"The very fact that Chechens are talking about cases of rape with outsiders shows how concerned they are about these abuses."""" Rape is considered a war crime under Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits in its Article 4 (Fundamental Guarantees), """"at any time and any place whatsoever ... outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault.""""

In a letter to the Home Secretary, who had invited the group to make written submissions, Human Rights Watch asked that any final decision be delayed until Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland had a chance to evaluate the records. """"The efforts of four states to prosecute General Pinochet for the most serious international crimes are being halted on the basis of secret evidence,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"This not only violates the United Kingdom's legal obligations, but it is also unworthy of the strict and principled adherence to the rule of law shown by Britain thus far in the case."""" Human Rights Watch noted that pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Torture, the United Kingdom is required to extradite or prosecute General Pinochet. Any exception to that obligation based on Pinochet's incapacity to stand trial must be capable of objective assesment, the group asserted. The organization recognized that the right to a fair trial implies a defendant's fitness, but it emphasized that it is not enough that an accused is sick or has a long term-illness, even one which might eventually be fatal. """"The thousands of people killed or 'disappeared' by General Pinochet's forces would have loved one day to become old and sick,"""" said Brody. Rather, said the group, the test is whether an accused has sufficient intellectual capacity to instruct his counsel, to understand the evidence, and to give evidence. The organization cited the French cases of pro-Nazi war criminals Klaus Barbie, Paul Touvier, and Maurice Papon, all of whom were of advanced age when their prosecution commenced; Papon was quite ill during the course of his trial.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/01/14/explanatory-memorandum-regarding-comprehensive-embargo-iraq","Explanatory Memorandum Regarding the Comprehensive Embargo on Iraq","Explanatory Memorandum Regarding the Comprehensive Embargo on Iraq","","01/14/2000","The comprehensive nature of the embargo imposed on Iraq since August 1990, its intensification of the Gulf War damage to the country's civilian infrastructure, and its unprecedented duration have produced a longstanding and serious humanitarian crisis in Iraq.   According to the 1996 UNICEF State of the World's Children,  The balance sheet of several years of sanctions against Iraq reveals a minimum of political dividends as against a high human price paid primarily by women and children. The food rationing system provides less than 60 percent of the required daily calorie intake, the water and sanitation systems are in a state of collapse, and there is a critical shortage of life-saving drugs.(2) These were the circumstances when the Security Council passed Resolution 986 in April 1995, authorizing Iraq to sell under U.N. auspices up to $2 billion worth of oil every six months. Thirty percent of the proceeds were designated for the Compensation Commission and four percent to cover the expense of U.N. operations in Iraq, including UNSCOM. Fifty-three percent and thirteen percent of the amount would be available to the government of Iraq and to the U.N.-run humanitarian program in the three autonomous northern provinces respectively to fund humanitarian imports. Iraq entered negotiations on implementation of the resolution in January 1996, and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on May 20 of that year. The first letters of credit were signed in February 1997 and deliveries commenced in late March. In response to reports of the secretary-general concerning the inadequacy of the program, in February 1998 the Council passed Resolution 1153, expanding the oil export ceiling to $5.2 billion every six months, with the same distribution of proceeds. Owing to generally low oil prices, Iraq only met (and in fact exceeded) this ceiling in the most recent sixth phase of the program ending November 20, 1999.(3) Increased Iraqi access to food, medicines, and other commodities since mid-1998, under the expanded oil-for-food program, has affected the humanitarian situation positively in some areas, while in others it has stopped the situation from worsening or slowed down the rate of deterioration. The cumulative contribution of the program to date has been $9.5 billion in funds available for humanitarian imports in the government-controlled center and south, or $455 per person, and $2.4 billion for the three autonomous northern governorate, or $710 per person.(4) The program contributed greatly toward heading off the famine conditions that appeared to be threatening in 1995. The provision of food has been relatively straightforward, mainly because the U.N. program has utilized the government ration system already in place. The direct provision of food commodities has supplemented the monthly ration basket the government provides to nearly all families, and in the process has lowered the free market cost of rationed and non-rationed foods. A similar situation appears to exist with regard to medicines.  The situation overall, however, remains alarming. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned in May 1999 of the """"steady deterioration of living conditions"""" and stressed that """"humanitarian action alone can not be a substitute for the country's needs.""""(5) In January 1999 the Security Council established three expert panels to report back on the situation regarding disarmament, humanitarian conditions, and missing Kuwaiti persons and property.(6) The second panel, on humanitarian conditions, concluded that """"the humanitarian situation in Iraq will continue to be a dire one in the absence of a sustained revival of the Iraqi economy, which in turn cannot be achieved solely through remedial humanitarian efforts"""" (para. 58). The panel also observed that """"[e]ven if not all the suffering in Iraq can be imputed to external factors, especially sanctions, the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of the war"""" (para. 45). The crisis has been particularly acute in the area of public health, putting millions of Iraqis, if not an entire generation, at grave risk. The humanitarian panel noted that communicable diseases that had previously been brought under control """"have now become part of the endemic pattern of the precarious health situation"""" (para. 21). Chronic malnutrition has affected nearly one in four Iraqi children for much of the last decade. UNICEF, comparing the 1984-89 and 1994-99 periods in the government-controlled center and south of the country, found that infant mortality had increased from 47 to 108 deaths per 1000 live births, while child mortality (under five years of age) has increased from 56 to 131 deaths per 1000 live births.(7) This is a rate of increase that is unprecedented. Put simply, children under five are dying at more than twice the rate of ten years ago. Lack of access to sufficient and appropriate food and medicine has been one element, but also crucial has been the degradation of the water and sanitation sectors, contributing to chronic intestinal and acute respiratory infections. There are no similarly reliable estimates regarding the threat to life that sanctions have posed for other vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population. Nor have there been any attempts to measure the harm suffered by those Iraqis--the great majority--who do survive beyond their fifth birthday, an effort that would require longitudinal studies of changes in physical well-being, mental capacity, educational achievement, and the like. The humanitarian panel concluded, based on the observations of the agencies in the field, that """"almost the whole young child population was affected by a shift in their nutritional status towards malnutrition."""" One public health expert who has closely studied the Iraq situation, Dr. Richard Garfield of Columbia University, has emphasized that """"excess deaths should thus be seen as the tip of the iceberg among damages to occur among under five-year-olds in Iraq in the 1990s.""""(8) The devastating impact of the sanctions is largely a consequence of their unprecedentedly comprehensive scope and duration, coupled with the fact that their imposition followed the military campaign to compel Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. This campaign, conducted under the authority conferred by Resolution 678 (1990), included air attacks that crippled most of Iraq's electrical power system. Because of the centrality of the country's electric power grid to water and sewage treatment, the health care system, agricultural irrigation, and other vital civilian areas, these attacks have had grave civilian consequences. The embargo, in turn, has severely impeded the repair and reconstruction of these sectors that together function as a life support system for most of Iraqi society. More than nine years after the war, it is less and less possible to resort to the make-shift repairs and cannibalization of parts that for a number of years enabled the country to keep in operation some of its pre-war stock of generators, transformers, water pumps, and similar sorts of equipment. This physical breakdown has been accompanied by the devastation of the country's human resource infrastructure. Real incomes and purchasing power of the great majority of Iraqis plummeted, leading many salaried professionals and skilled workers to emigrate or to shift to casual unskilled labor. This systematic """"de-skilling"""" of the population has been aggravated by the severe intellectual isolation stemming from the extension of the embargo to cover professional and scientific journals and books as well as travel outside the country to professional conferences and the like. The damage to the country's physical and human infrastructure and the acutely distressed income levels of most of the population have seriously compromised the beneficial impact of a program limited to commodities alone.  As available funds have increased following the humanitarian program's expansion under Resolution 1153, the 661 Committee has authorized the expenditure of a greater share of funds under the 986 program for the purchase of materials for infrastructural repair, including water and sanitation and electric power sectors, recognizing the critical role of these sectors particularly in addressing rising child mortality rates. Subsequently, the Council, in Resolution 1175 (1998), authorized use of $300 million in both the fifth and sixth phase of the program for rehabilitation of the oil sector, recognizing that this was essential in order to sustain funding for the entire humanitarian program. In October 1999 the Committee declined to act on the recommendation of Secretary-General Annan that Iraq be permitted to spend an additional $300 million on oil spare parts in the current sixth phase, following reported objections by the United States that additional funds generated in the sixth phase should be expended only on humanitarian commodities in the strict sense. Resolution 1284, however, adopted on December 17, 1999, asks the Secretary-General to report on the revenues necessary to meet humanitarian needs and if warranted to recommend additional allocations for oil spare parts and equipment.  The economic siege of the country has contributed directly to the general pauperization of the vast majority of people. The comprehensiveness and protracted nature of these sanctions, now in their tenth year, have had long-term consequences by, in particular, impeding the repair of the country's infrastructure--communication, transportation, education, government services. These generalized humanitarian consequences have radically complicated and limited the possibilities for meeting basic civilian needs under a program restricted to the delivery of commodities. The Secretary-General expressed this in his two-year review when he noted that """"there is little experience with the type of problems encountered when the whole spectrum of basic services starts to fail, as is happening in Iraq"""" (para. 55). Human Rights Dimensions of the Iraq Embargo The policies of the government of Iraq have greatly compounded and magnified the humanitarian crisis. These include Iraq's failure to comply fully with Resolution 687; its refusal between 1991 and 1996 to implement any """"oil-for-food"""" arrangement and its mixed record of cooperation since then; and its use of scarce available resources for non-humanitarian purposes--including military purposes as well as palaces and monuments--thereby redirecting the consequences of sanctions away from itself and onto vulnerable civilians. The recent reports of the Secretary-General on the operation of the humanitarian program have criticized the government's excessive warehousing of medicines and failure to order foods specially designed for the nourishment of infants, small children, and nursing mothers, and also noted Iraq's failure to cooperate with the program by routinely not providing government escorts for observer teams, thus preventing them from carrying out their duties. Broadly speaking, it is clear that the Iraqi government is not fulfilling its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to use """"the maximum of its available resources,"""" including """"international assistance and cooperation,"""" to provide an adequate standard of living and improve living standards.  At the same time, the member states of the Council, given their responsibility to the international community as members, have an obligation not to destroy or undermine the right of people to an adequate standard of living, the improvement of living conditions, freedom from hunger, and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. The Security Council must share responsibility for the enormous impact of the measures it has imposed on the well-being of Iraq's population. For this reason, we urge the Council to revise the present embargo in favor of a regime that targets specifically the ability of that government to import military and dual-use goods, and lifts restrictions on the import of civilian commodities and on financial transactions broadly, restrictions that have a disproportionately harmful impact on ordinary Iraqi people. The Convention on the Rights of the Child obligates States Parties, which include Iraq and all members of the Security Council with the exception of the United States, which has not signed the convention, to """"take appropriate measures: (a) to diminish infant and child mortality; (b) to ensure the provision of necessary medical assistance and health care to all children; [and] (c ) to combat disease and malnutrition including...through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water"""" (Art 24, 2). While there may be varied interpretations regarding the measurement of such rights as guaranteed by the Convention, policies that in fact promote the deterioration of nutrition and health, for instance, or directly impede their realization, clearly contravene these standards. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in a December 12, 1997 General Comment [E/C.12/1997/8], observed that sanctions """"almost always have a dramatic impact on the rights recognized in the Covenant,"""" noting that in addition to disrupting access to items necessary for survival, """"unintended consequences can include reinforcement of the power of oppressive elites"""" and """"the generation of huge windfall profits for the privileged elites"""" (para 3). The Committee further  consider[ed] that the provisions of the Covenant, virtually all of which are also reflected in a range of other human rights treaties as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, cannot be considered to be inoperative, or in any way inapplicable, solely because a decision has been taken that considerations of international peace and security warrant the imposition of sanctions. Just as the international community insists that any targeted State must respect the civil and political rights of its citizens, so too must that State and the international community itself do everything possible to protect at least the core content of the economic, social and cultural rights of the affected people of that State (para 7). Our recommendation is consistent with the view of many members of the Council itself. An October 30, 1998, draft of the issue paper of the chairs of the sanctions committee noted that """"[t]he decisions of the Security Council to impose sanctions imply the Council's obligation to ensure that proper implementation of sanctions does not result in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and its responsibility to do all within its power for the respect of the basic economic, social, and cultural rights and other human rights of the affected population...."""" Human Rights Watch is fully aware of the toll of recurrent and horrific human rights abuses committed by the government of Iraq. For this reason, we urge the Security Council to establish an international criminal tribunal, such as those the Council has authorized for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to indict and bring to justice Iraqi government officials and former officials against whom there is credible evidence of responsibility for acts of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The tribunal's writ should include the 1988 campaign to evacuate the Kurdish countryside as a site for anti-regime insurgency, in which the government destroyed more than 2,000 villages and a dozen towns, seized every Kurd in the """"prohibited area,"""" trucked off an estimated 100,000 civilians for execution, and used chemical weapons against its own citizens. Human Rights Watch has compiled ample documentary evidence, including hundreds of interviews with survivors and witnesses, and carefully reviewed some 18 tons of Iraqi secret police documents. The investigation should also include, but not be limited to, war crimes committed in the invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-91, the massive displacement and habitat destruction in the southern marsh areas, and, most recently, the """"prison cleansing"""" campaigns in which more than 2,500 persons in detention have reportedly faced summary and extrajudicial execution.  Reconciling enforcement and human rights The Council acknowledged its own responsibility to monitor the impact of the sanctions when it insisted, in Resolution 666 (1990), that it alone would determine whether """"humanitarian circumstances"""" had arisen, and instructed the Sanctions Committee established pursuant to Resolution 661 (the """"661 Committee"""") to keep the situation under """"constant review."""" However, neither the Council nor the Committee has done this since July 1991, when the Council received the report on humanitarian needs in Iraq from Sadruddin Aga Khan, the secretary-general's special representative. The Council's response was to pass the first """"oil-for-food resolutions, Resolutions 706 and 712, whose provisions were inexplicably far below those recommended in that report.(9) Those members who have been the strongest proponents of continued sanctions have dismissed or disparaged reports by specialized U.N. and other humanitarian agencies in the field and yet have not sought to develop more reliable or accurate accounts. The Notes of the president of the Council on """"The Work of the Sanctions Committee,"""" issued on January 29, 1999 (S/1999/92), expressed the consensus of the Council that """"sanctions committees should monitor, throughout the sanctions regime, the humanitarian impact of sanctions on vulnerable groups..."""" (para. 11). Yet in the case of Iraq, this recommendation has yet to be taken up. Paragraph 28 of Resolution 1284 (1999), which requests the Secretary-General to report on the progress made in meeting humanitarian needs, appears to meet this monitoring obligation only partially.  The ability of a single country representative to place an application on hold also continues to be a matter of concern. The secretary-general's ninety-day report dated August 19 (S/1999/896) complained of """"a significant increase in the number of holds being placed on applications, with serious implications for the implementation of the humanitarian programme"""" (para. 101). In an October 22 letter to the President of the Council (S/1999/1086), the secretary-general noted that the number of holds """"has continued to increase"""" and urged the Committee to """"undertake an urgent review of all applications currently on hold.""""(10) In a November 17 statement to the Council, Benon Sevan, executive director of the U.N. Office of the Iraq Programme, noted that 602 contracts worth $1.042 billion were then on hold. Some $73 million worth of contracts on hold in the agricultural sector resulted in the loss of as much as 20,000 tons of wheat production, he said, citing FAO estimates. He also noted that $377.7 million, or 51 percent, of electricity sector contracts from the fourth through sixth phases were still on hold, which could allow Iraq to increase its present power generation capacity by fifty percent. He cited similar concerns in the area of maintenance and safety equipment, and telecommunications. In light of the fact that applications forwarded to the Committee have been determined by the Office of the Iraq Program to comport with the distribution plan approved by the Secretary-General, and in light of the mandate of the Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq to """"observe"""" the end-use of imports under the 986 program, the increasing use of holds, most of them reportedly by the United States, appears to be capricious and unjustified.(11) At the very least, this situation highlights the long-standing need for the Council to address the absence of transparency and the apparently high degree of politicization with regard to the decisions of the sanctions committees.  Human Rights Watch recognizes that we are proposing steps that go beyond addressing humanitarian concerns in the most immediate sense of food, medicines, and spare parts for infrastructure repairs that address acute threats to life and physical integrity. While the oil-for-food program has gone a long way to meet these life-threatening aspects of the embargo, it was never intended to be a development program, and does not contain the elements of such a program. But this is precisely what is needed in order to begin to reverse the dangerously degraded state of essential civilian infrastructure and services in the country. We therefore strongly recommend that the Council revise the embargo so as to enable the rehabilitation of the country's civilian economy while retaining comprehensive import restrictions for all military goods and rigorous monitoring of """"dual-use"""" materials. We urge that the Council offset the lessened financial oversight of such an arrangement by making all goods entering Iraq liable to inspection at ports of entry, and continuing to monitor their end use. We note that under present arrangements, only those goods imported under the oil-for-food program are subject to U.N. inspection. All other imports, whether contracted by the government or other bodies or persons, and financed primarily through foreign exchange acquired through smuggling or remittances from Iraqis working abroad, presently enter the country without scrutiny. While our proposal would likely result in an expansion of import activity, it also calls for the establishment of a mechanism to inspect imported commodities for the purpose of ensuring that they are not military or """"dual-use"""" in nature, unlike at present.  Our proposal also envisions continued monitoring of the end-uses of imports, particularly those that might be diverted to military use. The duties of the Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq include monitoring the end-use of imported commodities. While additional monitors would be required under the restructured embargo we are proposing, the reports of the Secretary-General indicate that the observation personnel now in Iraq have generally been able to carry out their tasks, despite instances of Iraqi government non-cooperation. So far as we are aware, there have been no allegations that materials imported under the oil-for-food program have in fact been diverted to any significant extent to non-humanitarian purposes over the two-and-a-half years that the program has been operational. Because of the cumulative and systematic damage to Iraq's civilian economy and civilian infrastructure, the Security Council should allow for investment and development activities, under international supervision, in order to address the severe and pressing needs of most of Iraq's civilian population. These reforms will provide the Iraqi government with access to additional revenues, and it is a matter of serious concern that some portion of these revenues may well be used for purposes other than rebuilding the civilian infrastructure and meeting humanitarian needs. We believe that the Council, after nearly ten years of comprehensive embargo, must weigh any reasonably anticipated constructive consequences of the embargo's continuation in its present form, in terms of gaining government compliance with the Council's disarmament demands, against the demonstrated and severe harm it has caused to Iraq's civilian population.  We agree that the Iraqi government bears great responsibility for provoking and aggravating this humanitarian crisis. Precisely for this reason, we do not believe the Council can reasonably expect that the government will modify its behavior, even at the price of gravely damaging Iraqi society. The Council must do all within its reach to remove itself as a party to this destructive and deadly dynamic by ensuring that its actions lie well within the parameters established by basic humanitarian principles. The Security Council, when it adopted Resolution 1153 (1998) expanding the oil-for-food program, noted its """"determin[ation] to avoid any further deterioration of the current humanitarian situation."""" Existing conditions in Iraq as a result of war and sanctions, even in the absence of further deterioration, continue to have lethal consequences, especially for the most vulnerable sectors of the population. The preamble to Resolution 1284 (1999) notes that the Council was """"determined to improve that [humanitarian] situation."""" At a minimum, the resolutions of the humanitarian panel should be implemented without further delay in order to meet the goal articulated in Resolution 986, """"to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people until the fulfillment by Iraq of the relevant Security Council resolutions."""" The Council should also revise the sanctions regime to target military and dual-use imports, and take immediate steps towards the long overdue establishment of an international criminal tribunal that would indict and, to the extent possible, try those individual Iraqi officials and former officials credibly reported to be responsible for acts of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  1. This was the assessment of a July-September 1995 Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Crop and Nutritional Status Assessment Mission. For the great majority of households in the government-controlled center and south, the monthly basket of rations provided by the government was the key to survival. These rations comprised locally-produced food commodities as well as some imports purchased by the government with increasingly scarce foreign exchange. In October 1994 the government claimed it could no longer sustain annual expenditures of $700 million on food and slashed the monthly ration basket by thirty-seven percent. A joint report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the FAO in June 1995 reported that four million persons were nearly entirely dependent on rations and that one million were at serious risk. A World Food Program (WFP) Assessment Mission report of September 25, 1995, asserted that the problem was less one of food availability than the inability of Iraqis to afford market prices: it calculated that the free market value of a ration basket for a family of five was the equivalent of $10.50, or about three times the average salary of a government employee.  2. This section of the report can be found at www.unicef.org/sowc96/6sanctns.htm.  3. Benon Sevan, the executive director of the UN Humanitarian Program for Iraq, told the Security Council on November 17, 1999, that the overall shortfall in actual to authorized revenues stood at around $2 billion.  4.

Ambassador Celso Amorim of Brazil, who chaired the panels, submitted the three reports to the Security Council on March 30 1999. The report of the humanitarian panel is Annex II of document S/1999/356.  7. The UNICEF survey found that in the three autonomous northern governorates, where the U.N. itself administers the """"oil-for-food"""" program, under-5 mortality declined from 82 deaths per thousand live births in 1984-89 to 69 in 1994-99, while infant mortality in the same period fell from 66 to 57 deaths per thousand live births. These declines came despite an increase in child and infant mortality in these areas in the 1989-94 period. In a document issued on August 16, 1999 (""""Questions and Answers for the Iraq child mortality surveys""""), UNICEF stated that because """"oil-for-food"""" had been operational for only two of the five years covered in survey, the different trajectories in the north and in the government controlled areas could not be attributed to the differing administrations and """"it is too soon to measure any significant impact"""" of the program on child mortality. The agency noted that """"since 1991 the north has received far more support per capita from the international community"""" and that the more """"porous"""" borders in the north meant for less effective embargo enforcement. Other factors not mentioned by UNICEF, in addition to the larger per capita contribution of the oil-for-food program itself, include a relatively larger and more varied rain-fed agricultural sector, which made this area less dependent on food rations and lowered the market cost of food, and a """"cash component"""" equivalent to approximately ten percent of the value of the aid provided in the """"13 percent account,"""" facilitating distribution of goods and installation and repair of equipment. Another differential aspect, this one negative, was the impact of the """"internal"""" embargo imposed on the autonomous northern provinces by the Iraqi government which affected wages of public employees and ration allocations as well as costs of running public institutions.  8.

Report to the Secretary-General on Humanitarian Needs in Iraq by a Mission led by Sadruddin Aga Khan, Executive Delegate of the Secretary-General, 15 July 1991. The report estimated that it would cost $22 billion to restore Iraq's key sectors--power, water, sanitation, food, health, and oil--to pre-war levels, and proposed a limited UN-controlled sale of Iraqi oil to fund a portion of the country's humanitarian needs. Sadruddin Aga Khan suggested a sum of $6.9 billion for the first year, with an initial four-month sale of $2.65 billion (one-third plus start-up costs). After several weeks of debate in July 1991, Resolutions 706 and 712 were adopted in August and September allowing Iraq to sell $1.6 billion over six months, with thirty percent to go to the UN Compensation Fund and about four percent for UN expenses in Iraq, including UNSCOM, leaving $930 million for humanitarian imports over six months, compared to the $2.6 billion over four months proposed in the report. The Council resisted efforts of the secretary-general to raise the six-month allotment to $2.4 billion. The other major discrepancy between the report and the resolutions concerned the account in which the sums would be deposited: Sadruddin proposed a special account within the Iraqi State Oil and Marketing Organization, which would be open to Security Council scrutiny and from which payments could be made only for Council-approved humanitarian imports, while the resolutions specified a UN-controlled account. Yet another issue of contention was the question of in-country monitoring of the distribution of the imported commodities. Iraq never accepted the terms of the two resolutions, although intermittent negotiations continued until late 1993.  10. In an October 25 interview with the Washington Post, Secretary-General Annan charged that U.S. holds were """"disrupting"""" the humanitarian program. """"I think one should be transparent and not withhold some of these items unreasonably because it undermines our professed desire to help alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,"""" he said.  11. Reuters (November 18, 1999) cited U.N. sources as stating that of 389 contracts on hold the US accounted for 337 while the U.K. accounted for 29 and both countries together for 23.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq",""

Chechen fighters  have repeatedly beaten and threatened civilians who attempted to spare their villages from Russian bombardment. They have also endangered civilians by taking positions in areas that were heavily populated by civilians and firing at Russian aircraft. """"Chechen fighters are endangering civilians by trying to hide in their midst,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"But they are bound by the laws of war as much as any combatants. We call upon the fighters to take all necessary precautions to minimize civilian casualties.""""  As in the 1994-1996 war, Chechen civilians, chiefly the village elders, often try to prevent the destruction of their villages by approaching the Russian military and by encouraging Chechen combatants to leave their villages. Human Rights Watch has learned that in at least four villages, Chechen fighters, or """"Wahabbis"""" (as they are commonly called in Chechnya, due to their alleged conservative interpretation of Islam), have beaten and threatened civilians who asked the fighters to leave.  In Dyshne-Vedeno, a village in southern Chechnya near the Dagestani border, Islamic fighters detained and beat the head of the village administration and his sixteen-year-old son after he met with local Russian commanders to seek an end to Russian bombing there. According to village resident """"Magomet"""" (not his real name), on December 17, 1999 the fighters detained the official, Ramzan, and his son. The latter was found severely beaten the next morning near the village cemetery, but Ramzan himself was not released. When a large group of villagers, including Magomet, tried to negotiate Ramzan's release with Salman Basayev (the father of Chechen commander Shamil Basayev),  they were told to go away.  When villagers tried again on the following day (Dec 19) to meet with Chechen commanders, the fighters fired at the feet of the crowd and forced them to retreat.  Ramzan was released a week later, and told Magomet that he had been severely beaten.  Magomet told Human Rights Watch about other abuses committed by Chechen fighters under the command of Khattab, one of the principle commanders in Chechnya who is believed to be from the Middle East, and Shamil Basayev in Dyshne-Vedeno.  In early January, Magomet found the body of a Russian soldier whose throat had been cut in the village's Oktiabrski district, across the road from a group of Wahabbi fighters.  When he asked the fighters why the soldier had been killed, they replied that it was  their standard practice to slit the throats of captured Russian soldiers.  The execution of prisoners of war is specifically prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a war crime.  Magomet also said that Wahabbi fighters frequently fired on Russian war planes flying overhead, provoking the planes into bombing the village. """"It is as though they are . . .giving them an excuse to bomb the village, """" he said. According to Magomet, Wahabbi fighters sometimes deployed anti-aircraft weapons inside villagers' backyards, drawing war planes into bombing civilian areas of the village.  On Friday, January 7, two Russian war planes bombed the mosque in Dyshne-Vedeno during the mid-afternoon prayer session (at about 2:30 p.m.), causing eleven deaths, all civilians.  Many civilians were trapped in the village, unable to leave because of the continuous fighting and shelling in the area.  Magomet's account of Chechen and Russian abuses in the village could not be independently confirmed because few villagers from Dyshne-Vedeno have apparently been able to travel to Ingushetia.  However, his detailed account was consistent with accounts received about similar abuses committed by Chechen fighters elsewhere in Chechnya. On January 3 at about 4:00 a.m.,  Chechen fighters returned to the village of Ermolovski, just west of the Chechen capital, Grozny.  """"Akhmed"""" (not his real name) described what happened when the village elders tried to appeal  to the fighters, begging them to leave the village and spare its destruction:  The fighters didn't listen to the elders, they didn't listen to anyone. We tried and tried to talk to them, so that they wouldn't come to the village. We kneeled before them. They told us, 'Get out [of the village] if you want to live, we're going to fight here.' What happened? People were killed and the village destroyed. ... All the villagers who could, gathered in the center. In response the fighters began firing into the air, and into the ground saying 'Disperse, disperse,' trying to scare us. The elders said 'Why should we leave?  Let's talk, you are all our sons and brothers, think about that.' The fighters said, 'No, we're going to fight.'  The villagers dispersed, and Russian forces began shelling the village the next day, causing civilian casualties, according to Akhmed.  On December 18, civilians in Staraya Sunzha, an outlying district of Grozny, attempted to install a checkpoint on the road leading to Grozny to keep Chechen fighters and lawless elements out of their neighborhood.  According to Ali Murdalov, who witnessed the events, Chechen commander Shamil Basayev personally came to the checkpoint the next day with a group of about forty fighters, accused the villages of supporting pro-Moscow Chechen commander Beslan Gantemirov, and demanded that the villagers hand over a large number of weapons (which Murdalov says they did not posses).  When the villagers attempted to approach Basayev, his fighters fired at the feet of the civilians to force them to retreat.  A scuffle broke out after Basayev ordered all the men arrested. Basayev's troops arrested eighteen civilians, and the next day released all but one, whom they detained for a week and beat repeatedly.  According to Murdalov, who saw the man after he was released,  """"He had bruises all over and some of his ribs were broken."""" The civilians were forced to remove their roadblock and grant Chechen fighters free access to their neighborhood.  Chechen fighters similarly refused to leave the village of Alkhan-Yurt in November, before the Russian forces seized the town and went on a rampage, looting many homes and killing at least nineteen civilians, many of whom were summarily executed by Russian soldiers for resisting looting (see Human Rights Watch's December 28  letter to Prime Minister Vladimir  Putin).  Waha Muradov, a respected elder and the Mullah (Muslim religious leader) of Alkhan-Yurt, told Human Rights Watch that during the last two weeks of November he repeatedly tried to persuade the fighters to leave Alkhan-Yurt.  He first met with the fighters on November 16, telling them that the Russian forces were on a ridge overlooking the village and would destroy the village by shelling. """"I begged them on behalf of the village, please leave, this is no place for you to fight.""""  The rebel commander replied that he would not retreat, and when  the Mullah insisted, the fighters started firing their weapons in the air, threatening to shoot him  and the other village elders if they did not leave immediately: """"We met three times with the fighters, every time they kept saying the same thing, that they were not going to leave. Everyone is afraid of them.""""  The Mullah and other villagers from Alkhan-Yurt claimed that there were many non-Chechens fighting with Chechen forces, including  Dagestanis, Uzbek, Kazakhs, and men from the Middle East.  """"Valentina"""" (not her real name), a sixty-year-old woman from Grozny, told Human Rights Watch that she had seen Chechen fighters in the capital fire at war planes flying overhead, thereby endangering civilians in the neighborhood: """"They climbed up onto the roof of the school and brought the machine-gun up onto the roof and started to shoot at the planes.  Then they left.  The school was left undamaged, but in place of two houses [next to the school], there were two large craters. The houses were destroyed by direct hits.""""  On another occasion, according to Valentina, Chechen fighters were driving around Grozny in a heavy-duty military truck with a twin-barreled large machine gun.  A plane flew by and the fighters started to shoot at it.   People came out onto the streets and told the fighters not to shoot at the planes because the machine-gun fire would not reach the high-flying planes, but would draw fire.  After the fighters drove away, the planes bombed the area.  Human Rights Watch stressed that the abuses by Chechen fighters could not serve to justify the widespread indiscriminate shelling and bombing campaign of the Russian forces.    """"No matter how provocative Chechen conduct may be, it cannot justify the targeting of civilian  objects by Russian forces,"""" said Cartner.  """"Civilians often find themselves caught between Chechen fighters who refuse to leave their towns, and Russian forces who are bombing and shelling their homes.  Both sides need to take the necessary steps to limit the impact of their fighting on the civilian population, as required by the laws of war.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Today border police began enforcing the order at checkpoints and border crossings. The new order gives rise to fears that the Russians may undertake mass detention in """"filtration camps,"""" where many Chechens were systematically tortured during the 1994-96 Chechen war. """"Chechen males are now effectively trapped in a dangerous war zone,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is fundamentally unacceptable to deny civilian males, including children as young as ten, the right to flee from heavy fighting. And it's against international standards."""" Following a Chechen counteroffensive and significant Russian military setbacks in early January, General Viktor Kazantsev, Commander for the North Caucasus Group of Forces, reportedly blamed the Russian """"mistakes"""" on """"our soft-heartedness."""" On January 11 he ordered that only children under ten, men over sixty, and girls and women would henceforth be considered refugees. Gen. Kazantsev also ordered males between ten and sixty to be rigorously checked in detention centers for guerilla affiliation. In the first Chechen war, Russian forces operated three official detention centers in Grozny, Mozdok, and Pyatigorsk, although many smaller camps existed unofficially throughout the region. These centers were known as """"filtration camps"""" because fighters were supposed to be """"filtered"""" out from civilians; they became notorious as centers for systemic torture, beatings and ill-treatment of thousands of Chechen males. Soldiers at the main Chechen-Ingush border crossing confirmed to Human Rights Watch that they had received orders to turn back all men between the ages of ten and sixty who tried to enter or leave Chechnya, and Chechen civilians told Human Rights Watch that their male family members were stranded as a result. Datu Isigova, a refugee from Grozny, told Human Rights Watch that she was forced to leave her eleven-year-old son, Arbi, and her husband, Suleman, inside Chechnya today due to the new restrictions. Zura Mumayedova, a mother of three from Shatoi who arrived by bus at the Chechen-Ingush border on January 11, told Human Rights Watch researchers that four men she had been traveling with were ordered off the bus by Russian border guards, citing the new restrictions on Chechen males. Held at the border overnight, Mumayedova said that """"the Russian soldiers said that no men aged between ten and sixty would be allowed through."""" She stated that the border guards prevented a fifty-nine-year-old man from crossing the border. She said that two boys, aged twelve and thirteen, made it past the border guards into Ingushetia only by concealing themselves on the bus. Other refugees reported that many other men had been turned back from the border, and that mothers with young children had often decided not to cross the border because they did not want to leave their young children behind. Chechen men on the Ingushetia side of the border have been separated from their families, unable to cross back into Chechnya. Thirty-six-year-old Vayit Zagayev told Human Rights Watch that he arrived in Ingushetia in late December to get medicine for his bed-ridden mother and to obtain supplies for his family, currently living in Katyr-Iurt. Russian border guards today refused to allow him into Chechnya. Mauli Murtadaliyev, also thirty-six, said that the border guards would not let him escort the body of a deceased female relative back to Chechnya for burial. At the urging of Russian authorities, in recent weeks as many as 70,000 Chechen refugees have left refugee camps and temporary accommodation in Ingushetia and returned to their homes throughout Chechnya. In early January, renewed and intensive fighting erupted in Alkhan-Kala, Yermolovski, Alkhan-Yurt, Argun, Gudermes and Shali, following Chechen counter attacks. Human Rights Watch has documented several incidents in which refugees who returned to Russian-declared """"safe zones"""" were caught under shelling and killed in recent days. This escalation of the conflict means that large numbers of Chechen civilians may well be forced to again flee to safety in Ingushetia. """"Russian authorities are obliged under humanitarian law to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties and allow civilians to flee to safety,"""" said Ms. Cartner. """"By preventing Chechen men and young boys from leaving the republic, the Russian authorities are deliberately violating their international obligations. We call on the Russian government to rescind the order."""" Human Rights Watch called on the Russian authorities to allow an international monitoring presence at all check points, border crossings, and detention centers in order to ensure that Chechen civilians do not suffer abuse at the hands of Russian soldiers.

The major abuses of the Milosevic regime, including harassment of the political opposition and civic activists, restrictions on free expression, politically motivated trials, impunity for war crimes, and persecution of ethnic minorities, have decreased in frequency or disappeared altogether. Despite these improvements, there remain serious human rights concerns that must be addressed in the context of the ongoing integration of the FR Yugoslavia into European structures, including the Council of Europe, the European Union (E.U.) Stabilization and Association Process (SAP), and the NATO Partnership for Peace, all of which maintain standards for respect for human rights applicable to all participating states (see Appendix on Human Rights Requirements for joining the Council of Europe, Partnership for Peace, and Stabilization and Association Process).  This briefing paper discusses four main areas of concern and puts forward recommendations for improvements that should be made in each, ahead of the accession of FR Yugoslavia to the Council of Europe and as a precondition for advanced negotiations on SAP and Partnership for Peace membership. Specifically, in the course of these processes, the authorities in Belgrade should make concrete progress in the following areas: cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague; prosecution of war crimes before national courts; reducing and punishing police violence; and, ending discriminatory treatment of the Romani population. Failure to Cooperate Fully with the War Crimes Tribunal Progress on accountability has been slow, both with regard to the surrender of indictees to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the tribunal’s access to archives and witnesses in FR Yugoslavia. Where there has been cooperation, the authorities in Belgrade have presented it to the Serbian people as necessary only to avoid Yugoslavia's economic isolation, rather than as an expression of genuine commitment to uphold human rights and the rule of law on their merits and to act against their violation as a matter of principle.  The new authorities in Belgrade have transferred five ICTY indictees to the custody of the Hague tribunal; eight more indictees surrendered voluntarily. Seventeen indictees are believed still to be at large within FR Yugoslavia. In 2001, Serbian authorities surrendered to the Hague tribunal former president Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb Milomir Stakic, accused of genocide and war crimes against the non-Serb population in Prijedor municipality in 1992, and Bosnian Serb brothers Nenad and Predrag Banovic, accused of war crimes committed in 1992 in a detention camp near Prijedor. Blagoje Simic, another Bosnian Serb living in Serbia, surrendered himself to the tribunal under pressure from the Serbian government, as did retired General Pavle Strugar and former naval commander Miodrag Jokic, both of whom had been indicted for crimes committed in Dubrovnik in 1991. In the first half of 2002, only one individual, Bosnian Serb Ranko Cesic, accused of war crimes in a detention camp in Brcko in 1992, was arrested and transferred to the Hague. Five indictees surrendered voluntarily: Dragoljub Ojdanic and Nikola Sainovic, indicted for war crimes in Kosovo in 1999; Milan Martic, indicted for the cluster bomb shelling of civilian objects in Zagreb in 1995; Mile Mrksic, former Yugoslav Army commander accused of crimes against humanity for the alleged killing of at least 200 non-Serbs near the Croatian city of Vukovar in 1991; and Momcilo Gruban, a wartime shift commander in the Bosnian Serb-run prison camp near Prijedor.  On April 11, 2002, the Yugoslav parliament adopted a law on cooperation with the ICTY. Standing alone, the law does not fulfill Yugoslavia’s commitments to cooperate with the tribunal. Indeed, the law contains ambiguities and loopholes that could be manipulated to obstruct further cooperation. Without the actual transfer of indictees and of documents sought by the tribunal, the law means little. The most objectionable aspect of the law on cooperation is the provision stating that it applies only to individuals against whom indictments had already been issued at the time it came into force. Such a limitation clearly contravenes Yugoslavia’s obligations under the Statute of the ICTY, which requires all U.N. member states to honor the ICTY’s indictments, no matter when they are issued.  In addition to this significant loophole, the law also contains a number of ambiguities regarding procedures for cooperation with the ICTY. The law on cooperation states that the proceedings it regulates shall be expeditious. However, the law does not set out specific time limits for the investigating judge and police to act. This has already delayed the transfer of indictees. In the first two months after the enactment of the law, five indictees voluntarily surrendered to the tribunal. In late April, the authorities issued arrest warrants for the seventeen other indictees. As of mid-June, however, only one has been arrested. On May 23, Federal Minister of Interior Zoran Zivkovic suggested that only five or six indictees might still be in FR Yugoslavia. However, on the same day the head of the investigative office of the Belgrade District Court told the media that there was no proof that any of the indictees had escaped from Yugoslavia. Zivkovic’s statement raises concern that the government is creating an excuse for future inaction with regard to arrests of indicted war criminals. The authorities should further define the law’s commitment to expeditious proceedings by specifying a clear timeline according to which cooperation proceedings will progress.  In another potential loophole, the law requires that the tribunal prosecutor’s work in Serbia and Montenegro conform to the rights of Yugoslav citizens, international standards, Yugoslav law, Yugoslav sovereignty, and national security interests. Human Rights Watch has warned against domestic authorities invoking these vague standards to impede the prosecutor’s work. Indeed, since the enactment of the law, the authorities in Belgrade have invoked national security interests to impede the prosecutor’s access to the archives.  At the end of May 2002 Serbian and Yugoslav officials hinted at the possibility that the Hague tribunal would be allowed access to Yugoslav archives for specific documents, but they emphasized that full access could not be granted. Federal Minister of Interior Zoran Zivkovic has said that documents that may threaten national security interests would be withheld. This position ignores tribunal rules that regulate the prosecutor’s access to files, providing states an opportunity to receive tribunal-ordered protection from disclosing documents that affect national security interests. The proper course, therefore, would be for the Yugoslav authorities to take their national security objection to the tribunal, and in accordance with the rule of law, let the judges decide whether national security concerns justify non-disclosure. To date, the obstacles to prosecutorial review of the archives have left Slobodan Milosevic and his associates in Belgrade with greater access to official files than the Office of the Prosecutor.  The government has also failed to assist the prosecutor in accessing potential tribunal witnesses. This failure has also had a damaging impact on the ongoing trial of Slobodan Milosevic, where the testimonies of the officials once close to the former president would help to illuminate the facts alleged in the indictment.  Recommendations:  The government should amend the law on cooperation to eliminate its restriction to indictments issued before enactment of the law; the law must provide for cooperation with the ICTY regardless of the date of the indictment in question;  The government should take immediate steps to apprehend and transfer to the ICTY all remaining indictees at large on Yugoslav territory;  The authorities in Belgrade should take immediate steps to grant the ICTY full and unfettered access to requested documents in the possession of government ministries, including the Yugoslav Army, the Yugoslav Ministry of Interior, State Security, the Yugoslav Presidency, the Yugoslav cabinet, the Yugoslav Defense Ministry, the Serbian Presidency, and the Serbian cabinet. As a first step, the foregoing ministries should make an index of records and archives available to tribunal prosecutors and facilitate tribunal consultation with archivists so that the prosecutor can determine which documents are relevant to its on-going trials and investigations. In the cases of documents the Belgrade authorities deem to threaten national security interests, they should apply to the ICTY for a decision on whether disclosure is required, in accordance with Rule 54 bis;  The government should take immediate steps to facilitate ICTY access to potential witnesses;  The government should make a public, principled commitment to cooperate with the tribunal and its processes. Failure to Prosecute War Criminals Domestically Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have repeatedly expressed a preference for domestic war crimes trials over proceedings at the Hague tribunal. Indeed, the ICTY statute contemplates that where the tribunal deems appropriate, it may defer cases to competent national courts. Yet, while the Belgrade authorities appear rhetorically committed to domestic war crimes trials, there is scant evidence that they are prepared to follow through on this commitment. Hundreds of perpetrators of war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo live in the FR Yugoslavia, but only two war crimes trials have been held. In just one more case, the public prosecutor has filed an indictment against two suspects.  The failure to bring war crimes perpetrators to justice stems from a general reluctance on the part of the new government to address the abuses for which the previous regime was responsible. Government officials have done nothing to dispel the widely held belief in Serbia that crimes attributed to Serb forces—including in Dubrovnik (Croatia), Sarajevo and Srebrenica (Bosnia-Herzegovina), and Racak (Kosovo)—were staged by the forces fighting against the Serbs, or did not take place at all. Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica has accused the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague of being anti-Serb; other officials, more open to cooperation with the tribunal, portray cooperation as a task they perform against their will, in order to avoid the economic and political isolation of the country.  Such a stance by the authorities has encouraged the already hostile attitude in Serbia towards war crime trials of Serbs, whether these take place abroad or at home.  Between June and September 2001, the Serbian police exhumed five mass graves in Serbia, containing more than three hundred bodies thought to be Kosovo Albanians killed by the police and the army during the 1999 NATO bombardment. Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic confirmed in July 2001 that according to police estimates around 800 bodies were buried in mass graves at various locations in Serbia. Mihajlovic said police had taken statements of witnesses who claimed that the plans to remove these bodies had been arranged at secret meetings between former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and former interior minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic. A year later, however, there has been essentially no progress in resolving these cases. No criminal proceedings have begun, and the authorities have not made available information on the identities of the victims or the circumstances in which they lost their lives.  The police and the public prosecutor have blamed each other for the slow progress. The police claim that they have provided evidence to the public prosecutor on those who organized the transport of the bodies from Kosovo to Serbia. The district prosecutor in Belgrade responded in April 2002 by saying that he would prosecute only the perpetrators of the killings and not those who were involved in the transport. He added that evidence regarding the perpetrators was still missing.  The first of the two domestic war crimes trials held so far is that of Nebojsa Ranisavljevic, accused of abducting and killing nineteen Yugoslav Muslims at a train station in Strpci (in the border area between FR Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) in 1993. The trial began in 1998 in Montenegro and has not yet been completed. On May 7, 2002, the Belgrade Rail Company submitted to the court documentation indicating that top military, police, and civilian officials of Serbia and Yugoslavia knew of the plan to abduct the Muslim passengers from the train and took no steps to prevent it. Following the disclosure of this information in May, there has been no indication that an investigation would be launched.  On April 19, 2002, the district court in Prokuplje indicted Ivan Nikolic, a former soldier in the Yugoslav army, for the killing of two Kosovo Albanian civilians in May 1999. Nikolic had previously been charged with murder, but the prosecutor in Prokuplje amended the indictment to include war crimes charges. The Yugoslav media have reported on anonymous death threats received by the prosecutor since he indicted Nikolic for war crimes. The trial opened on June 11, 2002; during the first day of the trial, a war veterans’ association staged a protest in front of the court. On July 8, the court found Nikolic guilty and sentenced him to eight years in prison.  At the beginning of April 2002 the prosecutor in Prokuplje indicted Sasa Cvjetan and Dejan Demirovic on war crimes charges. The two reservists in the anti-terrorist unit of the Serbian police were accused of killing nineteen Kosovo Albanian civilians in Podujevo in March 1999.  Recommendations:  The Serbian government should take an unequivocal public position that trials for war crimes are a fundamental aspect of the rule of law and the principle of justice and a basic moral obligation owed to the victims;  The prosecutorial offices should apply existing law and promptly and determinedly initiate war crimes proceedings where available facts indicate that war crimes may have been committed;  The Ministry of Interior and other agencies should fully cooperate with investigative judges in the conduct of criminal investigations into well-documented cases of war crimes committed by the police and the paramilitaries in Kosovo in 1998-99; the information contained in the ICTY indictments and in credible reports by Yugoslav and international human rights groups should be used to prioritize the investigations.  Police Brutality The new Serbian government has not used police violence against the political opposition, but police abuses against ordinary citizens are still commonplace. Serbia has not carried out personnel changes in the police force essential to making a clear break from the practices of the former regime. Neither of the two constituent republics (Serbia and Montenegro) has in place mechanisms for civilian oversight of law enforcement.  The Serbian Ministry of Interior has either ignored allegations of police torture and ill-treatment made in the media and human rights reports, or claimed that it had no knowledge of the alleged events. In the five known court decisions since October 2000 dealing with excessive use of force, law enforcement officers found guilty received sentences of less than six months in prison. Most recently, on June 13, 2002, the Vrsac municipal court handed down a suspended sentence of two months of imprisonment to two police officers whom it found guilty of torturing a man in November 2000; also, on July 8, 2002, a court in Belgrade sentenced two policemen to three months in prison for torture of a Romani man in May 1998.  The Belgrade Center for Human Rights registered cases of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment in ten cities in Serbia during 2001. The following summaries of cases reported in the first three months of 2002 by the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center (HLC), suggest that the trend has continued unabated in 2002:  On March 1, 2002, six policemen broke up a birthday party in Belgrade after being alerted by neighbors about loud music at the party. The police severely beat three participants, including Nemanja Jovic (twenty-three), whose eardrum burst from the beating. The police then took Milan Milovanovic (twenty-three) in a car and drove to the woods. During the drive, the officers reportedly slapped Milovanovic and struck him on his sides with their elbows about a dozen times. In the woods, they kneed Milovanovic in the head several times.  On February 26, 2002, two police inspectors in Smederevo allegedly tortured Vladimir Radojicic (twenty-nine) on the premises of the Smederevo police station, using electric shocks and forced him to admit to stealing automobiles. A Serbian Ministry of Interior working group investigating the case concluded that Radojicic was injured during the arrest, but refused to acknowledge that Radojicic had been tortured;  On February 24, 2002, officers of the New Belgrade police station allegedly unlawfully detained and ill-treated fifty-one-year-old Miroslav Gajic, a painter from Belgrade. The incident began when two policemen came to Gajic's apartment on February 18 and asked him to produce a certificate saying that a magistrate had questioned him about a breach of public law and order. Gajic did not have the certificate and offered instead a document signed and stamped by the municipal magistrate. Just after midnight on February 24, another two police officers came to Gajic's apartment and told him to dress because they were taking him to the magistrate. On arrival at the police station, the officers took his shoelaces and belt, locked Gajic in a solitary confinement cell of about ten square meters without a window or any kind of ventilation. There were pools of urine on the floor and the walls were streaked with excrement and blood. He reported being held there for eight hours, all of which he spent on his feet as there was no chair or bench. The next morning, the magistrate apparently apologized to Gajic and said he had been unlawfully detained;  On February 9, 2002, five policemen in Novi Sad allegedly brutally beat eighteen-year-old Marko Brkic. Brkic was drinking beer with a group of friends in a nuclear fallout shelter in Novi Sad when an Intervention Police vehicle approached at top speed. The youngsters were frightened and ran away although they had not committed any breach of law. When one of the policemen fired two shots in the air, Brkic stopped running. Four other policemen then walked up to Brkic and began to beat him. Later that night, Brkic was admitted to the Emergency Hospital Center, where doctors established that he had a contusion of the ribs; and  On December 31, 2001, three police officers in Tutin reportedly inflicted serious bodily harm to Murat Pepic. The officers intervened when a fight broke out in a Tutin cafe. They threw Pepic out on the street and beat him with the butt of a pistol and a nightstick. Pepic was hospitalized in Novi Pazar and at the Belgrade Emergency Treatment Center for several days because of injuries to his head, kidneys, and ribs. FR Yugoslavia has not to date introduced a provision into its criminal law specifically defining torture as criminal offense, in spite of the recommendations of the United Nations Committee against Torture of November 1998.  The new federal Criminal Procedure Act, which entered into force on March 28, 2002, obligates the police to provide an arrested person with immediate access to a lawyer. The police must also immediately inform the investigating judge about the arrest, and the judge may request to see the detained person at once.  These provisions are expected to prevent arbitrary and excessive use of force by the police. However, the climate of impunity inherited from the previous regime and barely confronted by the current government raises doubts about the immediate implementation of these new rules.  Recommendations:  The authorities should end the practice of denying outright the occurrence of police violence and promptly launch criminal investigations when allegations are made, including by human rights groups;  Federal criminal law should be amended to define torture as a criminal offense;  The Serbian Ministry of Interior should undertake a vetting procedure and dismiss law enforcement officials found to have committed human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations under the government of Slobodan Milosevic;  Both republics should strictly enforce their laws on internal affairs that provide for disciplinary proceedings and sanctions for law enforcement officials who abuse their powers;  All police and other law enforcement personnel should receive human rights awareness training and be specifically instructed that they must comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.  Violations of the Rights of Roma Since the change of government in October 2000, the authorities in Belgrade have enacted a law that recognizes the Romani population as a national minority, and they have increased the use of the Romani language in state television and radio programs. However, police brutality against Roma continues to be common, and discrimination in various fields of public life remains widespread.  Recent instances of police violence against Roma, including minors, registered by the Humanitarian Law Center include the following:  On June 29, 2002, two Romani minors, fourteen-year-old Ljuvica Ristic and thirteen-year-old Dragan Stancic, were reportedly physically and verbally abused by a police officer in Belgrade. The children were washing the windshields of cars stopped at a busy intersection in the city when a police car with two officers drove up to them. The officer who had been driving got out of the car began yelling at the children, and punched Stancic in the face, causing his lip to crack. The same officer then allegedly proceeded to swear at Ljuvica and slapped and punched her on the cheek. A number of other Romani children witnessed the assaults from a nearby café.  On September 22, 2001, a police patrol physically abused a group of Romani children who were collecting waste paper in central Novi Sad. A girl of twelve was struck repeatedly on the head with a Motorola telephone and a policeman cursed her """"Shiptar [a derogatory term for Albanians] mother."""" E.M., a fourteen-year-old boy, was severely beaten and had his arm broken. Novi Sad Police Chief Major Sasa Adamovic stated in October 2001 that an inquiry into the incident """"brought out no involvement of members of the police force in the beating of the minor E.M.""""  A twelve-year-old Romani boy was beaten at the Belgrade Police Department on June 21, 2001. Failing to learn any details about a theft allegedly committed by the boy's brother, the inspector investigating the case proceeded to slap and hit him on the head, and beat him on the palms and back with a nightstick;  Nenad Filipovic was beaten by unidentified police officers in Kragujevac on May 26, 2001, first in the street, in the presence of his children, and then at the local police station. An asthmatic, Filipovic reportedly spent five hours handcuffed to a banister at the police station and was not allowed to use his inhalator when he suffered a strong attack;  On May 7, 2001, three police officers in Backa Topola ill-treated and uttered racial slurs against two Romani villagers, Stevan Brancic (thirty-eight) and Sasa Gojkov (twenty-eight). The officers apparently attempted to force the victims to confess to a theft;  On March 5, 2001, four policemen beat and uttered racial insults against Miroslav Milic, a Romani teenager from Belgrade;  Police in Leskovac detained Daka Zekic, a seventy-six-year-old Romani man for two days in January 2001, deprived him of food and water, and subjected him to beatings and racial insults. Thousands of Romani families live in makeshift settlements in the vicinity of towns, left to survive without electricity, running water, or sewers. In some Belgrade municipalities foreign donors were forced to withdraw their donations for the construction of housing for Roma because the authorities refused to provide the construction lot with utilities on which the housing could be built. In a case in Pozarevac, Swiss Disaster Relief withdrew its donation for a pre-fabricated building in which Roma children could attend preparatory classes for primary schools because the local authorities failed to allocate a lot for the building.  The position of displaced Roma from Kosovo has been particularly difficult because this group has suffered from both the lack of housing and police abuse. Their children do not have medical insurance and depend on the goodwill of doctors for care and treatment.  Roma displaced from Kosovo are also particularly vulnerable to arbitrary evictions from their makeshift homes, while the authorities have failed to provide them with alternative accommodation. In April 2002, six Kosovo Romani families who lived in wrecked cars and makeshift shelters in the Autokomanda neighborhood of Belgrade were forcefully evicted. A similar attempt by the Belgrade Building Land and Construction Bureau to evict nine Romani families, most of whom were displaced from Kosovo, from a settlement in the New Belgrade district was halted as a result of an intervention by the OSCE office in Belgrade and the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.  On June 12, 2001, at 5:00 a.m., two police officers stormed into the Novi Sad home of a Romani family displaced from Kosovo. A mother of four, her young children, as well as her sister were in the apartment at the time of the intrusion. One of the officers slapped and pulled the hair of the mother while asking where her husband was. The same officer punched her sister in the head and face, giving her a nosebleed, pulled at her clothing and kicked her. The officers forced the half-dressed women and children into a police car and allowed them to return to their apartment only upon their neighbors’ insistence.  In addition to violent abuse and harassment on the part of law enforcement authorities, Roma also continue to suffer widespread discrimination in all fields of public life, including in education, housing, employment, health care, and access to public goods and services. Denial of access for Roma to privately owned restaurants and sports facilities in FR Yugoslavia is also commonplace. Although public prosecutors are duty bound to prosecute such cases ex officio, they routinely dismiss discrimination complaints or simply fail to take any action to address them. The lack of willingness on the part of the justice system to pursue cases of discrimination against Roma in FR Yugoslavia is further compounded by the absence of comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination and providing adequate remedies for breach thereof. The legal prohibitions against discrimination that do exist in Yugoslav law do not provide for effective remedies and are rarely, if ever, invoked.  Recommendations:  The government should ensure that reports of police violence against Roma are investigated promptly and impartially, and that those found responsible for the abuses are brought to justice;  The government should adopt effective measures to prevent and punish manifestations of racial bias in the justice system, including by arranging for training of police, prosecutors, and judges, to educate them in binding international law prohibiting racial and other forms of discrimination, and its applicability in domestic fora;  The government should ensure that Roma, including those displaced from Kosovo, are not evicted from their makeshift homes, and seek to provide adequate alternative accommodation, in close consultation with the Roma themselves;  The government should conduct systematic monitoring of access of Roma and other minorities to education, housing, employment, health care, and social services, and establish a mechanism for collecting ethnic data with the view to combating discrimination in these fields;  The government should adopt a comprehensive body of legislation prohibiting ethnic, racial and other forms of discrimination in all fields of public life and providing effective civil, criminal and administrative remedies for breach thereof, and establish an effective enforcement, empowered both legally and through the provision of adequate resources to effectively secure full compliance with the new law. Appendix  Human Rights Requirements for Joining the Council of Europe, the European Union Stabilization and Association Process, and the NATO Partnership for Peace  Council of Europe  “Any European state can become a member of the Council of Europe provided it accepts the principle of the rule of law and guarantees human rights and fundamental freedoms to everyone under its jurisdiction.” (see here)  “The conditions for membership are pluralistic democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. Only those countries, which fulfill these criteria, can accede.” (see here)  The report entitled “The conformity of the legal order of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Council of Europe standards,” AS/Bur/Yugoslavia (2001) 1, available here, states that the following “most important measures” are necessary before the country can join the Council of Europe. These measures, quoted verbatim, include:  Complete abolition of capital punishment Amendment of the legal provisions governing the use of lethal force and firearms and new training, for the police and armed forces, with a view to preserving life Investigation of serious crimes dating from the recent past and cooperation with the ICTY Reform concerning all forms of deprivation of liberty, including those that are outside of the scope of criminal law Adoption of new legislation on minorities and of a program of re-integration into State bodies of persons belonging to the Albanian and other minorities Strengthening of the role of the courts in the protection of human rights. On July 2, Parliamentary Assembly President Peter Schieder handed to the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a list of commitments that it must be “determined to honour” following its accession to the Council of Europe. This list (available here) included:  Ratification of the Dayton Peace agreements and full and effective cooperation in their implementation; Signature and ratification of a number of key Council of Europe instruments, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; Domestic legal reform, including the adoption of legislation bringing the army under civilian control and legislation on the reform of the police that implements the European Code of Police Ethics, establishes training structures, and reorganizes the secret police and submits it to governmental and parliamentary control; Continued cooperation with the ICTY, in particular the obligation to apprehend and extradite all the indictees who remain at large, provide witness protection when required, instruct the police and prosecutors to make immediate arrests to remedy the shortcomings in the law on extradition in this respect, revise the law on co-operation with the ICTY in accordance with the Statute of the ICTY and the relevant UN Security Council Resolution, and make documents and archives, including military documents and archives, available to the ICTY without further delay; Cooperation with a view to establishing the facts concerning the fate of missing persons and provision of all information concerning mass graves; and Continued reforms with respect to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and the relationship between judges, prosecutors and the police.  European Union Stabilization and Association Process (SAP)  The E.U. Council Conclusions of April 29, 1997 stated that “to permit the beginning of negotiations, the following general conditions shall apply to all countries concerned [Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, FRY, FYROM, and Albania]:  1. Credible offer to and a visible implementation of real opportunities for displaced persons (including so called “internal migrants”) and refugees to return to their places of origin, and absence of harassment initiated or tolerated by public authorities;  2. Readmission of nationals of the States concerned who are present illegally in the territory of a Member State of the EU;  3. Compliance of the countries that are signatories of the GFAP [General Framework Agreement for Peace] with the obligations under the peace agreements, including those related to cooperation with the International Tribunal in bringing war criminals to justice;  4. A credible commitment to engage in democratic reforms and to comply with the generally recognized standards of human and minority rights.  5. Holding of free and fair elections at reasonable intervals on the basis of universal and equal suffrage of adult citizens by secret ballot, and full and proper implementation of the results of these elections;  6. Absence of generally discriminatory treatment and harassment of minorities by public authorities;  7. Absence of discriminatory treatment and harassment of independent media;  8. Implementation of first steps of economic reform (privatization program, abolition of certain price controls);  9. Proven readiness to enter into good neighborly and cooperative relations with its neighbors.  10. Compatibility of RS/FRY as well as the Federation/Croatia agreements with the Dayton Peace Agreements.”  The Annex to the Conclusions specifies the “[e]lements for the examination of compliance” with “human rights” and “rule of law” as follows:  Freedom of expression, including independent media Freedom of of assembly and demonstration Freedom of association Right to privacy, family, home, and correspondence Right to property Effective means of redress against administrative decisions Access to courts and right to fair trial Equality before the law and equal protection by the law Freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment and arbitrary arrest. In the area of “respect for and protection of minorities,” the Annex specifies the following “elements” for compliance:  Right to establish and maintain their own educational, cultural and religious institutions, organizations or associations Adequate opportunities for these minorities to use their own language before courts and public authorities Adequate protection of refugees and displaced persons returning to areas where they represent an ethnic minority. Most recently, the Stabilization and Association Report for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Commission of the European Communities, Commission Staff Working Paper 2002) outlined priority areas needing attention in the next 12 months, which included:  """"Existing good cooperation between Belgrade and Pristina, including within the competencies of the provisional institutions of self-government, should continue and develop. Parallel Serbian institutions and jurisdictions in Kosovo must, however, be dismantled. All parts of the FRY should be aiming for compatibility with European—E.U. and Council of Europe—standards. Army reform—including security policy, the role of the army and secret services, civilian control, general modernization/restructuring, and budgetary issues, in line with the proposals by the Geneva Centre for Control of Armed Forces—should be under way by the end of 2002. Reform of the security and police services should continue, transforming them into a service, adopting the Council of Europe's Police Code of Ethics, bringing them under clear internal and external control and improving coordination between the various services and with other state services. State security and law enforcement agencies must be separated. Prisons must be urgently brought in line with Council of Europe standards. The demilitarization of borders should be put into effect at the earliest opportunity. The principle of conscientious objection should be safeguarded and implemented. Steps should be taken to ensure the implementation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The findings of the Council of Europe compatibility study should become a cornerstone of human rights throughout the FRY, with implementation under way by the end of 2002. The European Convention on Human Rights should be ratified. Outstanding issues—democratic or technical—regarding media should be completely resolved by mid-2002. Coordination should be established between all Ombudspersons. Appropriate revisions of academic textbooks—particularly history and geography—should be completed before the end of the 2001-2 academic year. Outstanding issues regarding NGO status and political or religious association should be resolved by mid-2002, in line with Council of Europe recommendations. Anti-discrimination laws should be adopted and implemented. The death penalty, including with application to already delivered judgments, should be abolished in Montenegro. Legislation on minority rights, including relevant changes to Criminal and other Codes in line with the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (in force September 2001), should be urgently adopted and implemented. Cooperation with ICTY should improve. Indictees should be surrendered to the Hague—including and particularly those currently holding elected office or military positions. There should also be full cooperation on investigations, access to evidence (witnesses, documents, archives—particularly military) and, if a law is still considered necessary, it should be adopted immediately. UNSCR 1244, and the Common Document of November 2001, should be fully implemented. Review of the cases of all Kosovo Albanian prisoners should be completed, and the agreed transfers implemented by spring 2002 at the latest.”  NATO’s Partnership for Peace  The framework document (available here ), which is signed by all member countries, states that:  “In joining the Partnership, the member States of the North Atlantic Alliance and the other States subscribing to this Document recall that they are committed to the preservation of democratic societies, their freedom from coercion and intimidation, and the maintenance of the principles of international law.

""""Turkmenistan has once again proven that it is one of the world's most repressive states,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The price for speaking out there is jail, exile, or worse."""" On January 5 at approximately 4:00 pm, district police came to Nurmamedov's home in northern Ashgabad, the capital, and took him into custody, according to the Moscow-based Information Center for Human Rights in Central Asia, which obtained the information from Nurmamedov's family. Police reportedly told family members that they were looking for """"possible stores of weapons and narcotics."""" Family inquiries to the Ministry of Internal Affairs yielded no information on Nurmamedov's whereabouts; he is presumed to be in the custody of the State Security Service (KNB, formerly the KGB). No formal charges against Nurmamedov have yet been announced. Last month, Nurmamedov gave at least three interviews to Radio Liberty's Turkmen Service, the only source of non-governmental information for most Turkmen citizens. He criticized the December 12 parliamentary elections, in which the government allowed no independent or opposition candidates to participate, and called the decision of the parliament to effectively make President Niazov president-for-life both anti-democratic and unconstitutional. Nurmamedov also had contacts with foreign diplomats, meeting with a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation and attending the U.S. Ambassador's Christmas party in late December. Nurmamedov helped to found the never-registered Turkmen opposition party Agzybirlik (Unity) in 1989, and had been repeatedly detained and fined in the past for his political activity. """"When I met Nurmamedov last year in Ashgabad, he was extraordinarily courageous despite the constant surveillance which kept him a virtual prisoner in his own home,"""" said Cartner. """"His arrest shows that President Niazov has no intention of lessening the brutal repression, which only intensified in 1999."""" On September 9 of that year, political prisoner Khoshali Garaev, aged 37, died under extremely suspicious circumstances. In August, Turkmenistan imprisoned two figures critical of the government who had indicated interest in participating in the upcoming parliamentary elections. One received a five-year sentence but was amnestied; the other, Dr. Pirikuli Tangrykuliev is serving his eight-year sentence. Also in August Baptist pastor Shagildy Atakov was sentenced to four years in prison for his religious activity. Turkmenistan, which has effectively outlawed all religious groups organized by those other than Russian Orthodox Christians or Sunni Muslims, continues to wage war on unregistered religious congregations. In August, Turkmen security forces bulldozed a privately-built Hare Krishna temple and deported the group's leaders in August. In November, they demolished a Seventh-Day Adventist temple; the next month they forcibly deported four leading Baptists. International organizations dismissed parliamentary elections on December 12 as an empty exercise. Niazov himself told the parliament in late December that he will allow no alternatives to his ruling party for at least a decade. """"The recent declaration of Niazov as president for life, his wiping out of any and all potential opponents, the total repression of religious freedom--all of this should make Turkmenistan a pariah state,"""" said Ms. Cartner.

Human Rights Watch today condemned the United States for opposing an international prohibition against the use of children as soldiers. The US joins other governments Monday in Geneva for what is expected to be the final two-week session to negotiate the international minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict. """"The use of children as soldiers is one of the worst aspects of modern warfare,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"The US position on this issue remains one of the biggest obstacles to achieving a global ban on the use of child soldiers."""" An estimated 300,000 children under the age of eighteen are currently participating in armed conflicts in nearly every region of the world. Existing international law allows children as young as fifteen to be legally recruited and deployed into war, though children are generally defined as persons younger than eighteen. In 1994, the United Nations established a working group to draft an agreement raising the minimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities from fifteen to eighteen. However, five years of negotiations have failed to reach an agreement, though an overwhelming number of countries favor eighteen as the lower age limit for participation in armed conflict.  The US has vigorously opposed efforts to establish eighteen as the minimum age for military service, citing its own recruitment policies, which allow seventeen-year olds to enlist voluntarily with their parents' permission. However, Defense Department statistics show that fewer than 3000 seventeen-year olds are on active duty at any given time. The total US active duty force is 1.2 million. """"Maintaining this small number of seventeen-year olds in the US forces is not a military necessity,"""" said Becker. """"If the US is serious about ending the use of child soldiers, it must lead by example and exclude minors from its own forces."""" The US is proposing an alternative agreement which would allow each country to individually establish the minimum age it will respect for voluntary recruitment and participation in hostilities, assuming only that the age will be higher than 15, already mandated by current international law. In a December letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Human Rights Watch stated that the proposal """"virtually strips the [agreement] of its fundamental purpose"""" by failing to establish a universal age for participation in armed conflict and is not a significant advance over existing international law. Human Rights Watch noted that a large majority of the American public believes that combatants should be at least 18 years of age. A 1999 survey conducted for the International Committee of the Red Cross by Greenberg Research, Inc., asked """"At what age is a person mature enough to be a combatant?""""

But for thousands of other children who, like Elian, arrive in the United States without their parents, the reception they receive is anything but warm.  But for thousands of other children who, like Elian, arrive in the United States without their parents, the reception they receive is anything but warm. In Portland, Ore., last year, six Chinese children were held for eight months in a juvenile-detention center together with violent youthful offenders. One of the group -- a 15-year-old girl -- was held for several weeks after being granted asylum, even though she had an uncle in New York ready to care for her. She told a reporter: """"I never thought I'd end up in a jail like this.'' Every year, some 5,000 unaccompanied minors are detained by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some children come to this country seeking asylum, others hope to be reunified with family members already here, many are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Ultimately, many are deported or voluntarily return to their countries of origin. Bewildered and frightened, these children often are kept in jail-like settings while their cases are pending. Human Rights Watch has investigated conditions for children detained by the INS in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. We've found that such children frequently and systematically are denied fundamental human rights. """"Xiao Ling'' was one detainee interviewed during our investigation. She was detained at age 15. Though charged with no crime, she was sent to a secure detention facility in Pennsylvania, where she was housed with children accused of murder, rape and drug trafficking. She was assigned a small concrete cell, bare except for bedding and a Bible in a language that she could not read. She was forbidden to wear her own clothes or keep any personal possessions -- jewelry, hair ties, perfume, deodorant -- in her cell. She was forbidden to laugh or speak her native language. Not surprisingly, Xiao Ling says that during her detention, she cried every day. Although the average length of detention is 30 days, it is not uncommon for children to be held for six months or more. Cut off from their family and community, these children may become depressed or even suicidal. This isolation is compounded by a lack of staff with appropriate language skills. This leaves children who can't speak English unable to communicate even basic needs, or subject to disciplinary sanctions when they are unable to follow directions that they don't understand. Children detained by the INS often have great difficulty obtaining information on their legal rights and access to meaningful legal representation. Most children depend on pro bono representation, but few attorneys are willing to take their cases, and those who do often are unwilling to give the case much time and attention. International law states that children should be detained only as a measure of last resort, and only for the shortest possible length of time. Instead of being held in juvenile- detention centers, these children should be placed with foster families or in group homes. INS: JAILER AND PROTECTOR Many of the problems encountered by children in INS detention stem from the INS's troubling conflict of interest: The children are arrested, imprisoned and frequently deported, all by the same agency that is charged with caring for them and protecting their legal rights. As a uniquely vulnerable population, children are entitled to receive care from child-welfare authorities who will act in the best interest of the child and are capable of protecting children's rights. The INS is not such an agency. Elian Gonzalez faces an uncertain future. But while his fate is being determined, he is able to stay in a caring home, communicate in his own language and explore his environment. For many other children -- unnoticed and almost forgotten -- daily life is much bleaker.","United States","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Much will depend on the actions of Japan, historically Burma's largest bilateral aid donor.   A breakthrough will also require new flexibility by the Burmese government - and by Western governments.   Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has clearly signaled Tokyo's interest in trying to rekindle democracy and respect for human rights. He broke a 15-year taboo on high-level contacts with the Burmese regime when he met General Than Shwe in Manila in November.   That was followed by a ''private'' visit to Rangoon by former Prime Minister Ryutato Hashimoto. He reinforced the message that resumption of large-scale aid, suspended after the bloody military crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in 1988, could occur in exchange for ''visible'' signs of political and economic change.   Perhaps the generals were paying attention. The ruling State Peace and Development Council delivered on a promise to Mr. Hashimoto. Late last month it began reopening universities that had been closed for three years. The gesture fell far short of what was needed, but kept Japan's diplomatic initiative alive.   The real test is yet to come for both the regime and the opposition National League for Democracy led by the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. They must find a way to talk to each other.   Japan could help bridge the gap if it could convince the regime to cooperate fully with a joint effort by the United Nations and the World Bank. Tokyo can credibly use the carrot of new bilateral loans, as well as the possibility of renewed international lending. But Japan needs to be more explicit about the kinds of changes it expects.   There is an urgent need to develop a road map.   The elements of a reform program have been laid out. In the fall, the UN General Assembly adopted a tough resolution urging the government to end persecution of the league, open a ''substantive political dialogue'' with the opposition and cease ''widespread and systematic use'' of forced labor, especially in ethnic minority areas. The UN secretary-general's envoy went to Burma in October, along with a World Bank official, but talks with the government were inconclusive.   As reported by the International Herald Tribune, the World Bank's latest report on Burma recommends crucial economic reforms, coupled with political change, to reverse the country's slide into poverty and misery. The regime has invited the bank to send a mission to Rangoon for discussions, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been consulted by the bank on the report's findings.   But talks between Burma's leaders and officials of the United Nations or the bank will go nowhere unless Rangoon is ready to embark on a reform path. Lifting restrictions on free expression and assembly, and releasing political prisoners, would be obvious first steps as confidence-building measures. For meaningful dialogue between the government and the opposition, there must be a climate of goodwill on both sides.   Concrete action by Burma could trigger a response by others in addition to Japan. For example, if Burma took effective action to end the use of forced labor, and this could be independently verified, the European Union could reinstate trade preferences for Burma's agricultural and industrial exports, suspended in 1997. The International Labor Organization could reverse its de facto expulsion of Burma last year.   The Clinton administration could consider lifting some U.S. sanctions if all harassment and jailing of league members ended (although providing direct aid to the government would not be an option). In general, it may be useful for the United States to continue playing the role of ''bad cop'' to Japan's ''good cop.'' Yet Washington, too, must be flexible. An incremental approach to sanctions is likely to be more effective.   Burma might not be ready to shed its international pariah status. But an end to repression there would be a fitting way to start the new century, with the long-suffering people of Burma as the greatest beneficiaries.

In the letter to U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the current Security Council president, and the heads of other delegations, Human Rights Watch also called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and other top Iraqi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The letter charged that nearly ten years of a comprehensive embargo, coming on top of the 1991 Gulf War destruction of much of Iraq's civilian economic infrastructure, has created a public health emergency which the existing oil-for-food program and the resolution passed in December do not adequately address. A memorandum attached to the letter cites field reports by U.N. agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  """"The most adamant proponents of comprehensive sanctions have always insisted that their quarrel is not with the Iraqi people,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The time has come to put these words to the test.""""  Prohibitions against imports of a military nature should remain in place, the group said, as well as end-use monitoring of commodities with military as well as civilian applications.  The letter points out that no embargo, including the existing one, can ensure that Iraq does not get access to prohibited materials. It said that Iraq presently imports without significant restriction goods paid for with foreign exchange earned mainly from smuggling and remittances. It recommended that the U.N. offset the government's increased access to export and investment revenues under these proposed reforms by making all imports liable to inspection at ports of entry.  """"The scale of the crisis and the extent of the impoverishment require more than food and medicine and some spare parts,"""" said Megally. """"Even with the high level of funding of oil-for-food in 1999, life-threatening conditions still prevail. We agree that the Iraqi government bears a large share of the blame. But Iraq's callous manipulation of the sanctions is part of the reality that the Security Council has to take into account. Instead of being content to put all the blame on Baghdad, as the U.S. government continues to do, the Council has to face up to its own share of the responsibility. Blocking the government's access to foreign exchange is one thing, but choking the entire economy to do so puts the burden mostly on ordinary Iraqis.""""  The letter also urged the Security Council to implement promptly the recommendations of the """"humanitarian panel"""" it appointed last January. Many of these were part of the omnibus Iraq sanctions resolution adopted on December 17, but require further action by the Council or the sanctions committee. """"These recommendations should not be treated as bargaining chips to be implemented only if the Iraqi government cooperates,"""" said Megally. """"They are the least the Security Council must do to fulfill its own humanitarian obligations.""""  Human Rights Watch has extensively documented war crimes and atrocities committed by the Iraqi government, the letter said, and fully supports efforts to constrain and hold accountable those responsible. The group pressed the Security Council to establish an international criminal tribunal, like those already set up for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, to indict and prosecute Iraqi officials for whom credible evidence exists of responsibility for such crimes. The group noted that such a step was entirely warranted on the basis of the evidence it has uncovered, and would help dispel any suggestion that addressing Iraq's humanitarian crisis implied leniency toward the government.  Megally noted that half the non-permanent members of the Security Council have just joined this week, and urged them to promote a fresh approach to the Iraq crisis.  Human Rights Watch said the Security Council had acknowledged back in 1990 its obligation to monitor the humanitarian impact of the sanctions, but failed to follow through. The group said that an impartial humanitarian body or a special rapporteur should examine the practices of both the Security Council and the Iraqi government that affect the humanitarian situation in the country.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/01/03/letter-united-nations-security-council","Letter to United Nations Security Council","Letter to United Nations Security Council","","01/03/2000","In a letter to the Ambassador Richard Holbrooke President of the United Nations Security Council Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Security Council to tighten controls on Iraq's ability to import weapons-related goods, but lift most restrictions on non-military trade and investment in order to address the country's continuing humanitarian crisis.  The late March 1999 report of the Council's """"humanitarian panel"""" (Annex II of S/1999/356), the Secretary-General's two-year review of the """"oil-for-food"""" program issued on April 28, 1999 (S/1999/481), and the results of the UNICEF survey of child and maternal mortality released in August raise serious human rights and humanitarian concerns. These reports, as well as those from other humanitarian agencies in the field such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, make clear that life-threatening conditions continue to prevail in Iraq, stemming from a pervasive and protracted public health emergency. This emergency is largely a consequence of the destruction of the civilian economic infrastructure in the 1991 Gulf war, repair of which has been severely impeded by the comprehensive embargo on Iraqi exports and imports. Restoration of the civilian economic infrastructure is essential to returning child mortality rates and other public health indicators to the levels and trajectories that existed prior to the embargo and war. Although the """"oil-for-food"""" humanitarian relief program authorized under Resolutions 986 (1995) and now expanded under Resolution 1284 (1999) provides materials for infrastructure repair, as a temporary relief program it does not encompass the planning and investment required to restore Iraq's infrastructure to a level needed to meet the most basic civilian necessities.  As an organization that has extensively documented war crimes and atrocities committed by the government of Iraq, Human Rights Watch is fully aware of the need for strong international measures to constrain and hold accountable those responsible for such crimes. We recognize, moreover, that the policies of the government—its failure to comply fully with Resolution 687, its refusal to implement any """"oil-for-food"""" arrangement between 1991 and 1996, its mixed record of cooperation since then, and its use of scarce available resources for non-humanitarian purposes in order to redirect the consequences of sanctions away from itself and onto vulnerable civilians—have greatly compounded and magnified the humanitarian crisis. It is apparent that the Iraqi government has not complied with its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to use """"the maximum of its available resources,"""" including """"international assistance,"""" to provide an adequate standard of living and improve living standards.  The past ten years have made clear that the Iraqi government has no intention of making the humanitarian interests of the Iraqi people its first priority. The government's callous and manipulative disregard for its humanitarian obligations is not something the Council can reasonably expect will change. Rather, it is a reality the Council must take into account in deciding the appropriate means for securing the government's compliance with its disarmament demands.  Charges that Iraqi malfeasance and incompetence are entirely responsible for the severity and extent of the humanitarian crisis, moreover, are not credible. The Council should not use the high degree of Iraqi government culpability for the humanitarian crisis to obscure its own share of responsibility. The severe deprivations and widespread pauperization facing the great majority of Iraqis today cannot be dissociated from the unprecedentedly comprehensive and protracted character of the embargo. The Council should not continue the sanctions without substantial modification, in order to address the continuing humanitarian crisis and the inadequacy of the current humanitarian program. In trying to curtail Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction, the Council must devise means that do not aggravate the poverty and suffering of ordinary Iraqis, suffering that the government appears to find tolerable, even useful. In deploying instruments of coercion, including non-military instruments such as an embargo, the Council must be governed by the core humanitarian principle of minimizing threats to life and bodily harm of innocent people who bear no responsibility for the government policies being sanctioned.  Human Rights Watch therefore urges the Council to take the following steps to address Iraq's humanitarian crisis while targeting more directly the military ambitions of the Iraqi government and holding high government officials accountable for well-documented criminal actions: First: Address urgent humanitarian needs by implementing the recommendations of the Council's humanitarian panel promptly and without condition. Some of these have been incorporated into Resolution 1284 (1999), although in a form that requires further action by the Security Council or the sanctions committee. The Council has an absolute duty to address these urgent humanitarian needs without regard to the debate over the most effective way to secure Iraq's compliance with the Council's demands.  Second: Restructure the sanctions regime, so as to minimize its impact on the civilian population, by permitting the import of civilian goods and investments in the country's economy while strengthening prohibitions on imports of a military nature. The damage to Iraq's physical and social infrastructure and the acutely distressed income levels of most of the population will continue to limit the beneficial impact of a program restricted to humanitarian commodities. Third: Establish an international criminal tribunal to try Iraqi government officials and former officials for whom credible evidence exists of responsibility for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, and provide sufficient resources and authority for such a tribunal to discharge its responsibilities. Establishment of such a tribunal, in addition to being entirely warranted in its own right, will help clarify that addressing Iraq's humanitarian crisis does not imply leniency or concessions toward the Iraqi government and responsible officials. Fourth: Instruct the committee set up by Resolution 661 (1990) to oversee the Iraq sanctions (the sanctions committee) to conduct its operations with greater transparency and to monitor closely the humanitarian impact of the sanctions. Until now the Council's steps to meet its acknowledged responsibility to monitor these humanitarian effects have been inadequate. The lack of transparency in the committee's operations, in the context of the ability of a single member to block decisions, has raised legitimate concerns about politicization of the process for addressing humanitarian needs.  Addressing urgent humanitarian needs: Reports from U.N. humanitarian agencies and credible independent organizations such as the ICRC highlight a continuing dire humanitarian situation in Iraq. The humanitarian panel established by the Security Council in January 1999 summarized the information at its disposal as pointing """"to a continuing degradation of the Iraqi economy with an acute deterioration in the living conditions of the Iraqi population and severe strains on its social fabric"""" (para. 43). The panel stressed that while not all of the suffering could be imputed to sanctions alone, """"the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war"""" (para. 45).  The humanitarian panel set out a number of recommendations which in our view constitute the minimum steps required to address the humanitarian crisis. Resolution 1284 (1999) implemented one of these directly and immediately, namely the removal of any dollar ceiling on oil exports, thus allowing increased funding of the Iraq humanitarian program. Such increased funding, however, will be contingent on international oil prices remaining at the level reached in the last half of 1999 and Iraq's ability, given the dilapidated state of its production facilities, to continue exporting oil at its present peak capacity rate of around 2.2 million barrels per day. The resolution does not take on a related panel recommendation to authorize production sharing or other investment arrangements by foreign oil firms that could provide, outside of oil-for-food revenues, the equipment and maintenance needed to rehabilitate these facilities, although it does request the Secretary-General to appoint a group of oil industry and other experts to develop recommendations regarding this proposal within 100 days.  The resolution also encourages states and international organizations to provide """"published material of an educational character to Iraq,"""" a step that is vital in order to reduce the extreme isolation of Iraqi educators and health professionals in particular.  The resolution addresses two other key recommendations of the panel, although in a manner that makes their implementation contingent on further steps by the Council or the sanctions committee. First, paragraph 17 directs the sanctions committee to """"pre-approve"""" humanitarian items on the basis of lists to be submitted by the Secretary-General. Such items, once the lists are approved, would be subject to approval by the Secretariat and no longer be required to come before the Sanctions Committee. Second, paragraph 24 requests the Secretary-General """"to make the necessary arrangements, subject to Security Council approval,"""" to allow oil-for-food funds to be used to purchase local products as well as to train Iraqi workers and professionals and to compensate them for installation and maintenance of items funded by the humanitarian program. U.N. humanitarian agencies on the ground have for a number of years pressed for the provision of such a """"cash component,"""" until now entirely absent in the government-controlled area. Given the sharp politicization that has in the recent past attended the Iraq-related deliberations of the Council and the sanctions committee, and the fact that these proposals have been under discussion for many months, we earnestly hope that both will be implemented without further delay. These recommendations should not be treated as bargaining chips to be implemented only on condition of Iraqi government cooperation. Rather, they are the least that the Security Council must do to fulfill its own humanitarian obligations stemming from this conflict. They embody the assessment of U.N. humanitarian agencies in the field regarding what steps are required to meet vital civilian needs. These recommendations should be implemented independently of other steps the Council may take to secure Iraqi government compliance with the demands contained in Resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991).  Minimizing civilian impact: The humanitarian panel concluded in its report that """"the humanitarian situation in Iraq will continue to be a dire one in the absence of a sustained revival of the Iraqi economy, which in turn cannot be achieved solely through remedial humanitarian efforts"""" (para. 58). Implementation of the recommendations of the humanitarian panel will build on the achievements of the oil-for-food program in addressing immediate threats to the lives and physical integrity of ordinary Iraqis, but this humanitarian program does not contain the elements of comprehensive planning and economic revival that we believe are essential in order to reverse the dangerously degraded state of the country's civilian infrastructure and social services. Human Rights Watch therefore urges the Council to restructure the Iraq embargo so as to permit the import of civilian goods and investments in the civilian economy, while maintaining strict prohibitions on imports of a military nature.  The Iraqi government has had, and will continue to have, access to foreign exchange from smuggling and from the remittances of Iraqis living and working abroad. This access will certainly increase under the reforms we advocate here. We do believe, however, that a more inclusive monitoring of imports such as we propose can in part address the concern of the Council to prevent the government from developing weapons of mass destruction. There is no way to ensure completely that this greater access to foreign exchange will not be used for non-humanitarian or even prohibited purposes. We would point out that present arrangements under the total embargo also do not foreclose this possibility. The goods Iraq now imports using its existing foreign exchange resources are presently not subject to inspection: only items imported under the oil-for-food program are inspected upon entry, to see that they conform to approved contract specifications. We therefore recommend increasing international scrutiny of commodities entering Iraq, while removing prohibitions on the import of non-military goods and financial transactions.  The key elements of a restructured embargo would include the following: Removal of restrictions on the import of commodities that are not on the List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies and the Munitions List of the Wassenaar Arrangement or on the Schedules of Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Continued prohibition of all imports and exports of a clearly military nature. Continued close but transparent scrutiny by the Sanctions Committee of contracts to import items that have """"dual-use"""" applications.  Removal of restrictions on financial transactions involving civilian sectors of the economy, including foreign investments. Making all imported goods liable to international inspection at all Iraqi ports of entry in order to monitor compliance regarding restrictions on military and dual-use imports.  These recommendation would shift the emphasis from seeking to block all Iraqi government access to foreign exchange, and in the process continuing to choke the entire Iraqi economy, to preventing Iraq from importing military and dual-use commodities. We recognize that making all imports liable to inspection at ports of entry would incur substantial expense. This should be funded out of Iraq's export revenues, much as U.N. operations, including UNSCOM, have been funded since 1991. To the extent that Iraq does not permit such inspections in return for lifting non-military parts of the embargo, this proposal would require the consent of Iraq's immediate neighbors—Turkey, Iran, and Jordan. All three countries have, to varying degrees, argued for lifting of the comprehensive embargo, and would reap considerable benefits from the re-establishment of trade with Iraq, even if that trade includes an inspections regime. Any effective coercive measure of this sort involves high costs. Until now, those costs have been borne disproportionately by ordinary Iraqis, to the detriment of their lives and well-being. Our proposal is to focus the sanctions in order to reduce substantially the severe collateral impact on the Iraqi population.  Holding Iraq's leaders accountable: Human Rights Watch urges the Council to establish an international criminal tribunal, such as the tribunals the Council has created to address criminal accountability in former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, to examine available evidence regarding the responsibility of Iraq's leaders for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, and to bring those responsible to justice. The investigation should include the genocidal 1988 campaign to evacuate the Kurdish countryside, the so-called Anfal campaign, as well as war crimes during the occupation of Kuwait and crimes against humanity that have been credibly reported during the period from the Gulf war up to the present. The Council should provide all necessary resources for the Tribunal to fulfill its mandate in a timely and effective manner.  The Council should also request all countries to cooperate in arresting and bringing to justice in national courts Iraqi officials and former officials who appear within their national frontiers and for whom probable cause of responsibility for such crimes can be established.  Monitoring Humanitarian Impact: Under Resolution 666 (1990), the Council insisted that it alone would determine whether """"humanitarian circumstances"""" had arisen, and instructed the sanctions committee to keep the situation under """"constant review."""" Neither the Council nor the Committee has done this since July 1991, when the Council received the report on humanitarian needs in Iraq from Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Secretary-General's special representative. Those members who have been the strongest proponents of continued sanctions have disparaged reports by specialized U.N. and other humanitarian agencies in the field but have not sought to develop more reliable or accurate accounts. The Notes of the president of the Council on """"The Work of the Sanctions Committee,"""" issued on January 29, 1999 (S/1999/92), expressed the consensus of the Council that """"sanctions committees should monitor, throughout the sanctions regime, the humanitarian impact of sanctions on vulnerable groups..."""" In the case of Iraq, this recommendation has yet to be taken up.  Paragraph 28 of Resolution 1284 (1999), which requests the Secretary-General to report on the progress made in meeting humanitarian needs, appears to meet this monitoring obligation only partially. Human Rights Watch strongly urges the Council to establish an independent framework and mechanism for monitoring the humanitarian impact of sanctions imposed under its authority. This on-going evaluation should include in this case an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the U.N.'s humanitarian program, and the problems and complexities associated with that program. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, might be best positioned to carry out such a task. Another approach would be to create a Special Rapporteur whose mandate includes scrutiny of practices of both the Security Council and the government of Iraq as those pertain to the humanitarian circumstances of the population.  While Resolution 1284 (1999) includes several measures to facilitate more timely decisions by the sanctions committee, the Council should also instruct the committee to introduce greater transparency into its deliberations by making available information concerning its decisions and explanations for rejections and holds placed on applications.  In conclusion, we urge the Council to implement this set of recommendations in order to address more satisfactorily the humanitarian consequences of the sanctions regime it has authorized. The United States, the most adamant proponent of comprehensive sanctions, has frequently asserted that """"we have never had a quarrel with the Iraqi people,"""" to cite Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's words. But this embargo, unprecedented in its comprehensiveness and now well into its tenth year, has taken an enormous toll on Iraqi lives and had a ruinous impact on Iraqi society. It may be argued that the embargo, because it is not military in nature, does not require strict adherence to international humanitarian law. However, the most basic humanitarian principles must be taken into account in the application of coercive measures that affect the well being of a civilian population. We believe the Council has an obligation to address the question of whether it is appropriate to continue to impose severe hardship and bodily harm on civilians through means short of war that it would be prohibited from imposing in time of war.  I have taken the liberty of also addressing this letter to the New York-based representatives of the Security Council's other member states. We look forward to receiving a positive response at your earliest convenience. As always, Human Rights Watch stands ready to discuss our recommendations with you and with representatives of other member states, and we would be pleased to meet Your Excellency in furtherance of this aim.

That's because he is on death row himself, slated for execution in Texas on January 13. Like the lead character in the movie, Penry has the mind of a child -- and the government wants to execute him anyway. There's a chance, however, that the issues raised in the film will help people like Penry some day. Like the lead character in the movie, Penry has the mind of a child -- and the government wants to execute him anyway. The United States is almost alone in the world in allowing this barbaric practice. At least 33 mentally retarded men have been executed since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Some experts estimate that as many as 10 to 15 percent of the 3,000 men and women on the nation's death rows are retarded. A person is considered mentally retarded if he or she has significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning, which generally means recording an IQ score of lower than 70, and exhibiting deficits in adaptive behavior before the age of 18. An average IQ score is 100; Penry's measures at 54. Many of the mentally retarded on death row have committed terrible murders. Being guilty of a capital crime, however, is not enough to warrant the death penalty; U.S. law reserves it only for the most culpable or blameworthy offenders, based on consideration of their background, character, motivation and circumstances of their crimes. The mentally retarded can never meet the criteria of extraordinary blameworthiness. People with retardation are incapable of calculated, mature evil. A retarded person is simply not the same as other adults. They are childlike in many of their limitations: their ability to reason and develop skills needed to navigate in the world are permanently stunted. They have grave difficulties with language, communication, learning, logic, foresight, strategic thinking, planning and understanding consequences. They have problems with attention, memory and comprehension. They are limited in their ability to learn from experience, to control their impulses, to think in long-range terms or to understand causality. Children outgrow most of these limitations. Those who are retarded cannot. Penry was physically abused as a child, has organic brain damage and is mentally retarded. Twenty-two years old in 1979 at the time he raped and murdered Pamela Mosely Carpenter in Livingston, Texas, he had then -- and has now-- the mental capacity of a 7-year-old. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court overturned his conviction because the jury had not been allowed to fully consider his mental impairments. But the court stopped short of ruling that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment precluded execution of the mentally retarded. It concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the national ``standard of decency'' had evolved far enough to reject such executions. It is a sad commentary that the standard of decency of almost every other country in the world exceeds that of the United States when it comes to the death penalty. There has been progress, however: The federal government and 12 states specifically exempt people with retardation from capital punishment. Polls consistently show that even death penalty supporters believe people who are mentally impaired should not be executed. But in some two dozen states, including California, such executions are permitted. Legislatures refuse to change state laws because of tough-on-crime sentiment, exacerbated by the grief and quest for vengeance of the murder victim's families, and the failure of officials and the public alike to understand the significance of mental retardation and the difference between guilt and culpability. The execution of the mentally retarded also continues because their mental limitations make them even more vulnerable than other defendants to the often arbitrary and unfair treatment inherent in capital trials. In their characteristic quest to please authority figures, for example, mentally retarded defendants are likely to waive their rights without fully understanding them. Almost invariably poor, they are usually represented by court appointed lawyers who lack the skills, resources and commitment to handle any capital case, much less one involving a defendant with mental retardation. Penry, who was resentenced to death by another jury, now faces execution in less than two weeks. Lawyers pressing last-minute appeals hope to convince the federal courts that national standards of decency have evolved since the original Penry decision and that the execution of any defendant who is retarded should be prohibited as unconstitutional. No one argues that the mentally retarded should be free from criminal responsibility. But life imprisonment is sufficient to express society's outrage at horrible crimes, to hold offenders accountable and to protect society from further violence. It is time the United States join the world in recognizing the senseless cruelty of executing anyone with the mind of a child. ©2000 San Francisco Chronicle Page A19","United States, Criminal Justice",""
