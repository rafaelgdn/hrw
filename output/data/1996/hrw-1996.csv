Meeting in Shenzhen, the 400-strong Selection Committee appointed by China chose sixty individuals to replace Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council or Legco.  """"One fundamental right under international law is for people to freely choose their own government representatives,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. """"The British government only belatedly and partially granted that right to the people of Hong Kong, but the Chinese government is determined to take it away. With every member of the provisional legislature handpicked and approved by Beijing, the chances that this body will protect the basic freedoms of expression and association guaranteed under the Basic Law are slim, if exercise of those freedoms incurs China's wrath."""" She noted that in its first year of operation, the legislature will have the power to enact security laws that could have far-reaching repercussions for human rights in Hong Kong; the ultimate check on the constitutionality of those laws will be the National People's Congress in Beijing.  Since the adoption of the Basic Law, the document that will serve as the constitution of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong after July 1, 1997, the number of legislative councillors elected directly has increased from eighteen out of sixty in 1991 to twenty out of sixty in 1995. The appointment of all sixty seats in the provisional legislature by the Selection Committee, itself an appointed body, reverses the process of democratization in the territory. With over 70 percent of the 130 candidates also serving as Selection Committee members and therefore participating in the selection process, it is clear that the process of choosing the new legislators was neither free nor fair.  The provisional legislature will wield wide powers. According to a March 1996 decision by the China-appointed Preparatory Committee, it will be able to enact, amend, and repeal laws in accordance with the Basic Law for the """"proper operation of the SAR."""" This could be a mandate to revive draconian British colonial security laws since repealed by the current Legco; legislate on subversion, sedition, treason and secession; and repeal key sections of the 1991 Bill of Rights.  The Bill of Rights entrenched within Hong Kong law important provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was extended to the territory by Britain in 1976. The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 stated that the Covenant would remain in force after the transfer of sovereignty. The Chinese government now claims, however, that the Bill of Rights violates the 1984 agreement, which provided that the laws of Hong Kong should remain basically unchanged.  Today's selection arises from a 1994 decision by the National People's Congress (NPC) to dismantle the Legislative Council (Legco) along with the Urban and Regional Councils and the District Boards on June 30, 1997. Regarding the electoral reforms introduced in 1992 by Governor Chris Patten as a violation of the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and a series of correspondences between China and the United Kingdom in 1991 (the """"triple violations""""), Chinese authorities decided to derail plans for the current Legislative Council to remain in place until 1998. It decided to install a provisional legislature in its place as a pretext to avoid a legal vacuum. However, the Basic Law makes no provision for such a provisional body. And while the 1994 NPC decision calls for the dissolution of the current Legco, it does not call for anything to precede the first Legislative Council which shall be established in accordance with Article 68 and Annex II of the Basic Law, which state that such a body shall be constituted by election.  In light of the repercussions that the establishment of a provisional legislature may have on the enjoyment of human rights in Hong Kong, Human Rights Watch urges that:  The Chinese government allow the current Legislative Council to complete its four-year term, under the provisions of Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, thereby upholding the rights of the Hong Kong people to vote and to take part in the conduct of public affairs through their freely chosen representatives.  In the event that China insists on dissolution of the current Legco, it should explore options other than the provisional legislature, including that the first legislative council in the SAR be established in accordance with the Basic Law -- that is, on the basis of free elections.  How Beijing keeps its commitments to uphold basic human rights in Hong Kong should significantly influence the economic and political relations with China and its major aid and trading partners including the U.S., Japan, the European Union member states, Canada and Australia.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

State and federal officials in a position to address such misconduct often deny that it exists or fail to take adequate steps to prevent it. As a result, sexual misconduct in U.S. state prisons for women is emerging as an explosive national problem. Human Rights Watch calls on all states to adopt and enforce prison rules that clearly define and prohibit all forms of sexual misconduct, including sexual intercourse and touching, inappropriate visual surveillance, and verbal degradation and harassment. We further call on states to make all sexual contact by officers with prisoners a crime and to ensure that correctional employees who engage in such misconduct are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. .The United States has the dubious distinction of incarcerating the largest known number of prisoners in the world, of which a steadily increasing number are women. Since 1980, the number of women entering U.S. prisons had risen by almost 400 percent, roughly double the incarceration rate increase of males. Fifty-two percent of these prisoners are African-American women who constitute only fourteen percent of the total U.S. female population. According to current estimates, at least half of all female prisoners have experienced some form of sexual abuse prior to incarceration. """"The situation for women in U.S. state prisons is intolerable,"""" said Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project and an author of the report. """"Male officers are sexually abusing female prisoners while the state and federal governments largely look the other way. It doesn't take a lot of resources to remedy this problem, just the political will to put a stop to it."""" One of the main factors contributing to sexual misconduct in U.S. state prisons is that the U.S., in violation of international norms, allows male officers to serve in positions that involve constant physical contact with female prisoners. Thus, the increased number of women in U.S. state prisons are more often than not being guarded by men. In fact, in many women's facilities male officers outnumber their female counterparts by two, and sometimes three to one. All Too Familiar reflects research into sexual abuse of women in U.S. state prisons conducted by the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project and other Human Rights Watch staff from March 1994 to November 1996. It is based on interviews with the U.S. federal government, state departments of corrections and district attorneys, correctional employees, civil and women's rights lawyers, prisoner aid organizations, and over sixty prisoners formerly or currently incarcerated in eleven women's prisons in California, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and the District of Columbia (D.C.). It finds that male officers vaginally, anally, and orally rape and sexually assault and abuse female prisoners. They use mandatory pat-frisks to grope women's breasts, buttocks, and vaginal areas, view them inappropriately while in a state of undress, and engage in constant verbal harassment of female prisoners, contributing to a custodial environment that is often hostile and highly sexualized. In some cases, women have been impregnated as a result of sexual misconduct and some of these prisoners have faced additional abuse in the form of inappropriate segregation, denial of adequate health care, and/or pressure to seek an abortion. In committing such gross misconduct, male officers have abused their nearly absolute power over female prisoners to force them to have sex, either through actual or threatened physical violence or through the provision or, by implication, threat to deny goods and privileges. In other cases, male officers have offered or provided goods and privileges to female prisoners as a form of reward for engaging in sexual relations or have violated their most basic professional duty and engaged in sexual contact with female prisoners absent the use or threat of force or any material exchange. The U.S. is clearly bound under constitutional and international law to prohibit all forms of custodial sexual misconduct. Yet neither the nation's capital nor any of the five states investigated for this report are adequately upholding these national and international obligations. All of them have prison rules concerning sexual misconduct, but they often refer only vaguely to """"overfamiliarity"""" or """"fraternization."""" Where criminal laws exist, they are inadequately enforced. Among the obstacles to the eradication of custodial sexual misconduct are: -Correctional systems routinely refuse to acknowledge this problem and often only do so when class actions suits are lodged against them. -Most departments of corrections have failed to establish credible internal grievance, investigatory and disciplinary procedures that do not expose women prisoners to retaliation or punishment and guarantee that abusive officers are appropriately sanction. -Few state legislatures have established independent monitors to oversee the prison systems, leaving most departments of corrections to investigate themselves. -State police are not consistently informed of suspected criminal sexual misconduct and even when they are, such cases are rarely prosecuted. The ability of nongovernmental monitors and private attorneys effectively to challenge abuses within the state prison systems for women has been seriously compromised by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), which President Bill Clinton signed into law in April 1996. -The PLRA dramatically limits the ability of individuals and nongovernmental organizations to challenge abusive prison conditions through litigation. -It terminates any court order regarding unlawful conditions or practices in a given prison after two years, which is often an unreasonably short time to achieve any meaningful change in the way a prison is operated. -The PLRA restricts court-awarded attorneys' fees, which are the main income for prisoner rights attorneys, and severely limits the authority of federal courts to assign judicial officers to oversee prison reform, a key tool for implementing remedial court orders. The neglect of sexual misconduct by U.S. officials has reached the highest levels of the government. Under federal law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has the power both to prosecute correctional officials who violate federal civil rights statues and to investigate and institute civil actions against a state facility that is engaging in a pattern or practice of subjecting prisoners to """"egregious or flagrant"""" conditions. Unfortunately, while the DOJ has investigated some women's facilities for sexual misconduct, it is falling far short of its obligations to protect against this abuse. To our knowledge, the department rarely criminally prosecutes a correctional official suspected of sexually abusing incarcerated women, and civil investigations into abusive facilities are infrequent. Moreover, although the DOJ regularly receives complaints of custodial sexual misconduct, the department maintains no system for recording such complaints, nor does it systematically monitor the number of complaints concerning any particular institution or type of abuse. Absent such information, it is virtually impossible for the DOJ to ensure that it is fully aware of all the sexual misconduct problems that fall within its jurisdiction. In its first report to the U.N. committee that monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by the U.S. in 1993, the U.S. stated that the problem of custodial sexual misconduct in U.S. state prisons for women is """"addressed through staff training and through criminal statutes prohibiting such activity."""" Nothing could be further from the truth. Human Rights Watch calls on the United States publicly to acknowledge the custodial sexual misconduct that pervades its state prison facilities for women and makes the following recommendations urging the federal government and its constituent states to take meaningful steps to prevent, investigate, punish and ultimately eliminate this pressing problem. More detailed recommendations are included in the body of the report.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Women's Rights"

In Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and its Aftermath, released today, Human Rights Watch and the Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH) provide detailed and disturbing testimonies from women who survived horrific attacks on their families and themselves, only to face a future complicated by laws and practices that discriminate against them and social services that cannot begin to meet their needs. Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), convening on September 26 in Arusha, to investigate and prosecute rape and other gender-related crimes. In addition, we urge the Rwandan government to ensure that women are guaranteed equal protection under domestic law and alert the international humanitarian community to the necessity for their humanitarian programs to address women's needs, especially in the areas of health care, trauma counseling, housing, credit, and education. """"The genocide in Rwanda left a population that is 70% female, and the stories told by survivors defy comprehension. What is clear is that Rwanda will only rebuild itself through these women, and the international community must do everything possible to help them deal effectively with the past in order to move productively into the future,"""" said Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project.     Although the exact number of rapes that occurred in Rwanda may never be known, testimonies in the 104-page report confirm that rape was extremely widespread and that women were individually raped, gang-raped, raped with objects such as sharpened sticks or gun barrels, held in sexual slavery or sexually mutilated. These crimes were frequently part of a pattern in which women were raped after they had witnessed the torture and killings of their relatives and the destruction and looting of their homes. Women from both the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups were raped, although most rape and other forms of violence were targeted against Tutsi women.     Until very recently, the ICTR largely neglected its responsibility to investigate and prosecute rape. It has to date issued no indictments for rape and other forms of sexual violence. Initial investigations were hampered by serious methodological flaws, including investigative procedures which were not conducive to eliciting rape testimonies from Rwandan women. In July 1996, the International Tribunal took the welcome step of forming a sexual assault committee to coordinate the examination of gender-based violence and has begun to investigate such abuse. However, unless the ICTR takes further steps to incorporate attention to sexual violence into its overall work, rape and other gender-based crimes could go unpunished.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice, Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1996/08/17/mexicos-maquiladoras-abuses-against-women-workers","Mexicos Maquiladoras- Abuses Against Women Workers","Mexico's Maquiladoras: Abuses Against Women Workers ","","08/17/1996","The Mexican government fails to protect women from pregnancy testing and other discriminatory treatment in export-processing factories (maquiladoras) along the U.S.-Mexico border. In No Guarantees: Sex Discrimination in Mexico's Maquiladora Sector, released today, the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project finds that major U.S.-based and other corporations routinely subject prospective female employees to mandatory urine testing, invasive questions about their contraceptive use, menses schedule or sexual habits in order to screen out pregnant women and deny them jobs. Human Rights Watch also finds that some maquiladoras mistreat or force to resign women who became pregnant shortly after being hired. Mexico's maquiladora sector is dominated by U.S. corporations, which own at least 90 percent of the factories. Maquiladoras are a source of billions of dollars a year in export earnings for Mexico and employ over 500,000 workers, at least 50 percent of whom are women. Maquiladoras owned by major corporations, including General Motors, General Electric, Zenith, Panasonic, W.R. Grace, Sunbeam-Oster, Carlisle Plastics, Sanyo, and AT&T, were all found to require pregnancy exams as a condition of employment, thereby subjecting women applicants to a different hiring criteria than men. In response to a letter from Human Rights Watch, the Zenith Corporation noted, """"[I]t is common practice among Mexican and maquiladora employers in Matamoros and Reynosa to inquire about pregnancy status as a pre-existing medical condition,"""" and admitted to screening out pregnant women from its applicant pools in order to avoid the costs of company-funded maternity benefits. Based on interviews with women from more than forty maquiladoras in the states of Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tamaulipas, the report concludes that the majority of the companies investigated in the report conduct pregnancy testing using their own medical personnel or those in nearby private clinics. Maquiladora personnel told women applicants that if they were pregnant they would not be hired and if they became pregnant they would be fired. Although the outright firing of pregnant women is uncommon, Human Rights Watch documented cases of maquiladora personnel forcing pregnant workers to work unpaid overtime; reassigning pregnant employees to more physically difficult work; and refusing to give pregnant women workers seated or lighter work assignments—all in an effort to force them to resign. """"The Mexican government should not tolerate maquiladora development at the expense of women's human rights,"""" according to Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project. """"Sex discrimination is prohibited by Mexican and international human rights law. We are troubled that U.S. and other corporations openly practice sex discrimination, and that the Mexican government allows this discrimination to flourish unchecked."""" Pregnancy testing violates Mexican federal labor law, which explicitly prohibits distinctions among workers for such reasons as sex and ensures equality between women and men in the workplace. It also violates Mexico's constitution and international labor and human rights obligations. Under Convention No. 111 of the International Labor Office (ilo), Mexico is required to prohibit discrimination based on gender in employment, including pregnancy-based discrimination. Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (iccpr) and the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination against Women (cedaw) obligate Mexico to prohibit sex discrimination. cedaw explicitly prohibits pregnancy-based employment discrimination and obligates governments to take positive measures not only to remedy discrimination against women, but to ensure that women lead lives free from discrimination. Each of these international agreements is binding on Mexico. No Guarantees: Sex Discrimination in Mexico's Maquiladora Sector documents that the Mexican government's labor mechanisms responsible for monitoring compliance with the federal labor code, advising workers on their rights, and adjudicating labor disputes fail to provide remedies to women who have yet to be hired, since they only take on cases of people who already have a labor relationship with the employer. However, labor officials also fail to condemn consistently discrimination in those instances where women were already employed. Some labor officials saw themselves as being unable to monitor vigorously maquiladoras for compliance with the federal labor code for fear of reprimand from higher officials in Mexico City, because the maquiladoras were seen as an untouchable source of employment and foreign-income earnings. As a direct consequence of Mexico's failure to remedy discrimination, women workers are subjected to routine invasions of privacy and to violations of their internationally guaranteed right to control freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children without discrimination.","Americas, Mexico","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Child Labor"
