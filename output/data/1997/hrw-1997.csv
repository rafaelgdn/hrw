According to sources in Bosnia and Hercegovina, Dutch forces attached to the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR), apprehended Vlatko Kupreskic and Anto Furundzija early Thursday, December 18. Kupreskic, publicly indicted by the ICTY for his role in attacks on Bosnian Muslim civilians in the Lasva valley, was arrested in Ahmici, the village where the alleged atrocities took place. Furundzija, the subject of a sealed indictment for war crimes, is accused of being a commander of the """"Jokers,"""" a special forces unit within the Bosnian Croat Army (which reportedly included Miroslav Bralo) alleged to have committed war crimes in the Lasva valley.    The Vitez arrests contrast sharply with today's remarks by President Clinton that peace in Bosnia can be made to work without the arrest of Radovan Karadzic. President Clinton's view flies in the face of the growing consensus that Karadzic is the single largest obstacle to the implementation of the Dayton agreement. It is especially cynical because the President makes his remarks on the same day that the Administration decided in principle to an extension of the US military participation in the NATO-led peace force. """"Extending the mandate is not enough,"""" according to Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, """"fulfilling that mandate and making peace work in Bosnia and Hercegovina will require the kind of leadership and political will that led to the Vitez action.""""     Thursday's arrests reconfirm that encounters leading to apprehension can be arranged in accordance with SFOR's existing mandate, even when the indictments are public. Two European countries, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have now taken the lead in operations to apprehend indicted war crimes suspects in Bosnia and Hercegovina. By contrast, the United States' failure to arrest and Clinton's remarks indicate US willingness to tolerate the continuing influence of indicted war crimes suspects. Human Rights Watch urges the United States and France to arrest all persons indicted for war crimes in Bosnia and Hercegovina in their sectors, including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The organization also strongly protested the continuing policy of referring civilians to military prosecutors, and trying civilians in the military court, which it said lacked independence. It urged Mr. Hariri to reverse the policy of widening the jurisdiction of the military court to include the prosecution and trial of civilians for peaceful political activity.  The full text of the letter is attached.  BY FACSIMILE  18 December 1997 His Excellency Rafiq Hariri Prime Minister of the Republic of Lebanon Office of the Prime Minister Beirut, Lebanon Your Excellency: Human Rights Watch/Middle East is writing to express deep concern about recent government interference with the privately owned broadcast media in Lebanon, and the suppression by security forces of a peaceful gathering in the Ashrafiyeh section of Beirut on December 14. These actions represent, in our view, serious setbacks for freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and the rule of law in Lebanon. We also find it alarming when civilian authorities resort to the military justice system as a threat to deter peaceful political activities, as recently happened with the ten Lebanese who were referred to the military prosecutor following their arrest, and the arrest of over fifty others, in East Beirut on December 14. Our organization has repeatedly called for a reversal of the cabinet's August 1993 decree that banned """"all assemblies and processions with or without a permit."""" This categorical prohibition of peaceful public gatherings prevents Lebanese citizens from exercising the internationally recognized right to peaceful assembly. Those who choose to exercise this right put themselves at risk of arrest, as the events near the MTV television station in Ashrafiyeh on the evening of December 14 so dramatically illustrated. Several hundred students and professionals who had assembled there to protest the state's restrictive audio-visual media policies and the Syrian presence in Lebanon were forcibly dispersed with tear gas and clubs. Some were injured and over sixty were arrested by internal security forces, including Hikmat Deeb, secretary general of the engineers and architects syndicate, and lawyer Georges Haddad. Deeb suffered a fractured rib and finger and as of today remained in hospital. Physicians also documented injuries suffered by Georges Atallah (blows to the head, right arm and right rib cage) and Patrick Khoury (trauma to the thorax and abdomen). The suppression of the demonstration, and the use of excessive force by security forces, was unwarranted.  With respect to freedom of expression in Lebanon, Human Rights Watch continues to be concerned about the manner in which the state is regulating and restricting the privately owned broadcast media. We monitored the implementation of Lebanon's audio-visual media law, and in a report published in April of this year we recommended that the power to issue broadcasting licenses should be placed in the hands of a regulatory authority independent of the government. We also noted the vaguely worded content restrictions in the 1994 broadcasting law and the 1996 broadcasting decree, and concluded that such restrictions could be used by authorities to stifle free expression. Indeed, the recent statements and actions of Information Minister Bassem al-Sabaa, described below, place the broadcasting freedom of Lebanon's privately owned audio-visual media in jeopardy. The minister has challenged the right of privately owned stations to present to viewers a diversity of information and political views, including those of well-known opposition figures.  On December 11, Mr. al-Sabaa met with MTV and reportedly expressed a """"wish"""" that the station's planned broadcast on December 14 of an interview from France with exiled Gen. Michel Aoun be cancelled, terming it """"an attempt to destabilize the government."""" The information minister also said that day that authorities considered it """"harmful to national interests"""" when prominent members of the political opposition were permitted to """"appear on TV and distort facts before the public,"""" a reference to the interview with exiled former President Amin Gemayel that was broadcast by MTV on December 7. The information minister, in effect, banned the Aoun interview, and Human Rights Watch is unaware of any disclosure by authorities of the legal basis for this action. MTV director Gabriel Murr said that the information minister had clearly communicated the """"wish,"""" and that """"we do not have any other choice than fulfilling this wish."""" On December 15, Mr. al-Sabaa made clear at a press conference that he would not tolerate criticism of Syria by the Lebanese media: """"In my position as information minister and in my capacity as a journalist, I cannot and I will not agree to being a guardian for any particular party which is trying to use the media as a means to disturb the peace and, in particular, aims to destroy relations with Syria.""""  This ominous trend toward greater state censorship of the media is contrary to pledges that the government made last year. On February 11, 1996, just prior to the issuance of the decree designed to implement the provisions of the broadcasting law, then-Minister of Information Farid Makari, noting that freedom of expression is """"safeguarded"""" by Lebanon's constitution, said on Radio Lebanon :  What the government is doing to organize the media in Lebanon, particularly the audio and visual media, is primarily intended to organize the media organs and not to restrict or confiscate them. We realize, just as you do, that safeguarding freedom is a sacred duty, for they are the pillars of Lebanon's existence without which there is no justification for the state's existence.  Developments this month, however, indicate the government's intent to restrict media pluralism, particularly when stations attempt to disseminate ideas and opinions of the political opposition, including criticism of the Syrian role in Lebanese affairs. The information minister made it clear in recent public statements that he would not permit the media to be used to harm Lebanon's relations with Syria. The close bilateral relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and its impact on governance and human rights conditions in Lebanon, is an issue of deep interest to many Lebanese. Human Rights Watch believes that the views that Lebanese express privately on this subject should also be permitted to be aired fully on radio and television, and in the print media. To obstruct public discussion and debate about one of the most important political issues in the country fundamentally compromises the basic provisions of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Lebanon has ratified and pledged to uphold.  Last, Human Rights Watch strongly protests your government's policy of referring civilians to military prosecutors and trying civilians in the military court for vaguely worded offenses such as """"incitement to conflict"""" or """"threatening national security."""" The military justice system, which is under the jurisdiction of the ministry of defense, is not an independent tribunal and most of its judges are military officers. The court is known for carrying out summary trials in which the right of defendants to due process and fair trial are violated. The court's proceedings and judgments cannot be reviewed by a judicial body that is independent of the military justice system. In April 1997, the U.N. Human Rights Committee noted """"the lack of supervision over the military courts' procedures and verdicts by the ordinary courts,"""" and recommended that Lebanon transfer to the ordinary courts """"all trials concerning civilians and ...all cases concerning the violation of human rights by members of the military.""""  We are gravely concerned that while the majority of the arrested in Beirut on December 14 were eventually referred to civilian prosecutors, ten were singled out and sent to the military prosecutor. According to our information, their names are: lawyer Georges Haddad, engineers Hikmat Deeb and Ziad Abs, law students Tony Harb and Georges Rabahia, science students Tony Mukheiber and Tony Ateeq, business student Bassam Lataif, Paul Basil, and Dani Aoun. Lawyers and human rights activists in Lebanon told Human Rights Watch that they have been unable to obtain an official list of those referred to the military prosecutor from the secretary of the military court. Although the ten were released on December 16 without any explanation or charges, they were all were assigned to their places of residence, which means that they are unable to leave Lebanon. """"We can be called back [by the military prosecutor] at any time,"""" one of them told Human Rights Watch. A lawyer who spoke with the military prosecutor on December 16 told Human Rights Watch that the prosecutor said he had taken no action against the ten. """"But it's still iffy,"""" the lawyer said. """"The military court was used as a threat by civilian authorities."""" We respectfully urge the Lebanese government to bring its practices into conformity with the standards set forth in international human rights law and, in particular, to ensure that citizens enjoy the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. We further call upon the government to reverse the policy of widening the jurisdiction of the military court to include the prosecution and trial of civilians for peaceful political activity. We will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in Lebanon, and welcome a reply at your earliest convenience.

A copy of the open letter is attached. December 17, 1997 President Bill Clinton The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, D.C. Dear President Clinton:  In the wake of the European Union's decision to postpone membership talks with Turkey until it improves its human rights record, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz travels to Washington this week in search of unconditional support. In your meeting with Prime Minister Yilmaz, we urge you to emphasize that the U.S. will not compromise its human rights standards in its strategic partnership with Turkey.  Persistent human rights violations in Turkey include widespread police abuse and torture, restrictions on the right of free expression, and serious abuses committed by both sides in the conflict between the Turkish government and the separatist Workers Party of Kurdistan. This human rights situation can only serve to destabilize Turkey and undermine U.S. economic and security interests in the country.  Since coming into power last July, Mr. Yilmaz's government has taken some limited steps to improve the situation, but has demonstrated little commitment to achieving lasting change. For example, the Yilmaz government can be credited with an August law that resulted in the release of at least 10 editors who had been jailed on free expression charges. At the same time, other laws restricting free expression remain on the books and continue to be used to punish, fine, and imprison journalists and writers, to confiscate and ban publications, and to fine and temporarily close television stations. In a similar vein, Mr. Yilmaz vowed to end torture and police abuse, but credible reports of these practices have continued. This month Mr. Yilmaz issued a circular to security forces forbidding torture and abuse; but these crimes are already banned under Turkish law and similar circulars by former governments have had little result.  Mr. Yilmaz has attempted to deflect E.U. criticism of Turkey's human rights record by claiming religious discrimination by the E.U. But such responses leave unanswered the challenge to the Turkish government to take concrete steps to improve Turkey's deplorable human rights record. Stated U.S. policy toward Turkey has been to balance concern about the human rights situation with strategic security and trade interests. At this time, when Turkey is in particular need of U.S. support, we urge you to underscore that such support is conditioned on clear signs of progress on the human rights front.

Human Rights Watch, which opposes the use of the death penalty in all cases, said it was especially troubled by several recent Revolutionary Command Council decrees greatly expanding the number of crimes punishable by death. Among these decrees is Revolutionary Command Council Decree 95/94, which allows for the death penalty in cases involving smuggling vehicles and machinery out of Iraq. Such decrees are in clear violation of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iraq is a signatory, which clearly states that """"[i]n countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes."""" Many of the decrees also allow for trial by special courts under supervision of the ministries of interior and defense that do not meet minimum fair trial standards specified in the ICCPR. HRW called on the Iraqi government to release fully information about the trial of the four, including the precise charges and the text of the judgment against them, the court in which they were tried, whether they had full access to defense counsel and the right to call defense witnesses and question prosecution witnesses, the mechanism for appeal to a higher tribunal, as required by international human rights law, and the dates on which such proceedings took place. Human Rights Watch also asked the Iraqi authorities to facilitate the families' request that the bodies be returned to Jordan, to guarantee the safe passage to Jordan of the wives and children of the al-Doji brothers, to investigate the alleged disappearance of the younger al-Doji brother, and to provide information on his whereabouts. """"We are concerned about the safety of all the family members remaining in Iraq. If the younger brother is in Iraqi custody, we would like to know the legal basis for his detention, and receive assurances that he can be visited by legal counsel,"""" Megally said.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, Jordan",""

At the same time, the government of President Alberto Fujimori has undermined officials in the attorney general's office and court system who might have served as a check against these abuses, and has seemed to encourage attacks against politicians and journalists who have denounced them. Torture and Political Persecution in Peru notes that the widespread abuses typical of prior years, including """"disappearances"""" and arbitrary detentions, have tapered off as the government has gained the upper hand in its fight against the guerrillas, but it lambasts what it labels a """"routine"""" and """"institutionalized"""" security force policy to torture. The recent and most welcome abolition of so-called faceless courts, an abusive system used to try cases of terrorism, will not eliminate torture unless further reforms are implemented, according to the report, which contains detailed recommendations for the Peruvian and United States governments. """"Well-documented episodes of torture have been accompanied by a steady erosion of the powers of key constitutional bodies entrusted with the defense of human rights,"""" commented Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas. """"In addition, the press and politicians have come under attack for criticizing human rights abuses committed by the Fujimori government,"""" he added. Torture and Political Persecution, released in English and Spanish, details the role of torture in the government's counterinsurgency strategy, including an egregious operation mounted by the military in response to the December 1996 occupation of the residence of the Japanese ambassador by the T£pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario T£pac Amaru, MRTA). In March of the following year, before army commandos broke into the ambassador's residence and released seventy-one of the hostages held by the guerrillas, the Peruvian army detained more than forty coffee growers in Alto Yurinaki, where they believed the MRTA guerrilla column responsible for the attack had originated. Based on interviews with victims and witnesses, Human Rights Watch/Americas determined that the army tortured almost all of the detainees in an attempt to force them to incriminate themselves and their neighbors as members of the MRTA. The army variously beat them, submerged them in tanks of water, made them stand without food in the sun for hours, and shocked them with electricity. Authorities later ordered the release of all but one of the detainees for lack of evidence. Torture in Peru takes place within a framework of counterinsurgency measures that both facilitate such abuses and shelter them from discovery or sanction, according to the report. Detainees suspected of what Peruvian law defines as terrorist offenses may be held incommunicado by Peru's anti-terrorist police for up to ten days without a court order. At the same time, the Fujimori government has weakened autonomous public bodies designed to ensure that justice is administered fairly and in accordance with the law and human rights principles, including the Constitutional Court and the Office of the Attorney General. In parallel with executive branch actions undermining the authority and autonomy of governmental watchdogs, journalists and politicians who have reported on or criticized torture have suffered a series of attacks. Baruch Ivcher Bronstein, for instance, a naturalized Peruvian citizen, was forced by the government to give up his majority ownership in Channel 2 television as well as his Peruvian citizenship after the station broadcast news that intelligence officials had tortured one of their own agents in the basement of army headquarters in Lima. Film shot secretly in the military hospital showed the fingers and ankles of the agent, Leonor La Rosa, inflamed and scarred from burns reportedly inflicted with a blowtorch. La Rosa had been under investigation after secret intelligence plans to intimidate journalists and members of the opposition were leaked to the press. Meanwhile, Congress, dominated by Fujimori's Cambio-90 party, has stalled on plans to introduce laws expressly prohibiting torture. The report contains recommendations for both the Peruvian and United States governments.  The government should institute an immediate and impartial investigation into the use of torture in Alto Yurinaki in March 1997. Military personnel responsible for torture and those responsible for the operation during which it occurred should be disciplined and prosecuted. The results of the inquiry should be made public, and compensation and an official apology should be provided to the victims.  The crime of torture should be individually and specifically included in the Penal Code with penalties appropriate to its seriousness.  Although the armed forces lack authority to conduct interrogations of civilian suspects, they regularly do so. This should be clearly prohibited, and those who breach the prohibition should be sanctioned.  The Office of the Attorney General of the Nation should take measures to improve the vigilance of provincial prosecutors in preventing the occurrence of torture, and prosecutors who fail to attend interrogations and searches should be disciplined and sanctioned.  The government should investigate thoroughly and impartially the abductions and violent attacks on members of the press, politicians, and other public personalities documented in this report. Those responsible for these crimes should be prosecuted and punished.  The Clinton administration should suspend all assistance to Peru's National Intelligence Service, which has reliably been reported to be involved in numerous human rights violations, including a campaign of harassment of the press and illegal phone-tapping. The United States should publicly distance itself from the SIN's de facto chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, who is widely perceived in Lima to enjoy Washington's support.  The administration should seek support from other members of the United Nations for the assignment of a special rapporteur or an independent expert to monitor and publicly report on the human rights situation in Peru.","Americas, Peru","Torture"

It urged donors to convey to Hanoi that economic development depended on accountable government and the easing of controls on freedom of expression and association. It also urged donors supporting rule of law programs to raise concerns about the way in which new administrative decrees and regulations were being used as an instrument of political control.  The 15-page report, """"Rural Unrest in Vietnam,"""" documents the causes and implications of continuing protests against corruption, land disputes, and compulsory labor in Thai Binh province beginning last May, as well as violent unrest in the largely Catholic district of Thong Nhat in Dong Nai province last month, initially sparked by expropriation of church land by corrupt local authorities. Despite statements by Communist Party Secretary Do Muoi and other officials that to maintain stability, citizens should be allowed to """"exercise their democratic rights through the mass media,"""" the government has clamped down on domestic and foreign media coverage of these disputes and put in place new state tools for social and political control. No new laws have been adopted since the Eighth Party Congress in 1996 strengthening the rights of Vietnamese citizens in line with the government's international obligations and its own Constitution. After a decade of economic growth, there is now a downward trend in Vietnam, coupled with stark disparity between the income levels of rural and urban populations, according to the World Bank. Human Rights Watch/Asia applauds statements by top Vietnamese officials acknowledging the urgent need to address these fundamental problems and widespread local corruption. But the donors can play a useful role in pressing the government to go beyond rhetoric to take concrete action. Human Rights Watch/Asia urges the donors in Tokyo to call for the repeal of the Administrative Detention decree promulgated in April 1997, giving local officials authority to arbitrarily detain anyone suspected of """"threatening the national security"""" for up to two years without trial; to urge adoption of legislation safeguarding the right of Vietnamese and foreign journalists to report objectively as an essential element in liberalizing the economy, and to cease censorship of the domestic media; and to continue pressing for an independent and impartial judiciary. Assistance from the World Bank, and UN Development Fund, and international donors to promote the rule of law is useful, but further technical and financial assistance should be conditioned on the government's willingness to bring its laws into conformity with international standards in the key areas of freedom of press, association, speech and assembly.","Asia, Vietnam",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/12/09/human-rights-curtailed-ethiopia","Human Rights Curtailed in Ethiopia","Human Rights Curtailed in Ethiopia","","12/09/1997","Despite frequent statements about its commitment to the enforcement of human rights standards in the country, the Ethiopian government's actual practices, detailed in Ethiopia: The Curtailment of Rights released by Human Rights Watch today, significantly deviate from these principles.   The government daily violates the civil and political rights of Ethiopian citizens by denying them the basic freedoms of speech, assembly, and association. The practices of arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and torture in detention continue under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) which took power in May 1991 after defeating the Derg military dictatorship. Commenting on the announced visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Ethiopia today, Peter Takirambudde, the Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch said """"we are reminding the United States that it is time to insist that Ethiopia meets its international human rights obligations. We call on the U.S. government to use its economic and strategic support for the country to induce and to facilitate human rights improvements.""""   With the legacy of the Derg behind it, the EPRDF proclaimed, as it instituted a four-year transitional period (1991-1995), its commitment to democratization and respect for the rule of law and pledged to establish human rights in the country. The transitional legislature ratified the major international human rights treaties. The constitution of today's Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia offers detailed basic human rights guarantees and provides for the incorporation into domestic laws of all the human rights treaties to which Ethiopia is party. New laws were enacted that guarantee the respect of human rights and civil liberties, institute the independence of the judiciary and the press, and provide for multipartyism and free universal suffrage, theoretically allowing the convening of competitive elections for the first time in the country's history.   Upon taking power in 1991, the EPRDF actively promoted a policy of ethnic federalism that influenced the subsequent constitutional, political, and administrative restructuring of the country. At the same time, it moved effectively to dominate the political system by favoring regional parties affiliated with it and clamping down on opposition and civil society groups.   The emerging contours of the political scene generated a particular set of human rights problems. Among the major human rights concerns:   Arbitrary Arrest and Torture   In remote regions, where government forces sporadically confronted armed dissident groups pressing for self determination on ethnic grounds, village shakedowns followed armed encounters or were used to preempt such encounters. As a result, hundreds of civilians were held in 1996 and 1997 under the authority of regional governments that suspected them of supporting armed opposition groups. As documented in Ethiopia: The Curtailment of Rights, this particular category of detainees faced the greatest risk of political killings, torture, and harsh and inhumane treatment, mainly at the hands of members of rural militias and other security forces that enforce law and order in remote rural areas. The absence of effective judicial oversight and the restriction of the work of most rights monitoring groups to the capital has meant most of those suffering abuse have had no recourse to legal remedy or to public denunciation.   Freedom of Expression   Other crackdowns severely curtailed the exercise of civil and political rights. The government attempted to bring a boisterous private press in line by the routine use of detention and imprisonment, and the imposition of prohibitive fines and bail amounts on journalists and editors.   Freedom of Association   The exercise of constitutionally guaranteed freedom of association was severely curtailed as activists loyal to the government targeted the two largest labor organizations in the country, the Ethiopian's Teachers' Association (ETA) and the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU), for control. Indicative of the predicament of ETA was that its president, Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat, started his second year in prison in May 1997, pending the conclusion of his trial on charges of heading an armed clandestine anti-government group. And on May 8, 1997, the police said they had shot and killed his successor at the head of ETA, Assefa Maru. The police statement claimed that the union official, who was also an executive committee member of the independent Ethiopian Human Rights Council, resisted arrest when police caught him preparing a terrorist act with other accomplices, and charged that he had replaced Dr. Taye as the leader of the clandestine armed group. Human Rights Watch interviews with eyewitnesses and photographic evidence, indicated that Assefa Maru was shot in the street on the way to his office.   According to the testimonies, at least four police teams took part in the assassination-style killing. Despite constitutional guarantees of the right to associate and organize, conflicting policy and administrative regulations have left non-governmental organizations in confusion and uncertainty. Newly founded organizations have found it difficult to register, some already existing organizations have been deregistered. The government continued to deny the veteran Ethiopian Human Rights Council legal status, contending that it was a political organization. In November 1997, seven Oromo elders and board members of the newly founded Human Rights League were detained and charged, in December, with terrorism and stockpiling of arms. The Ogaden Human Rights Committee, established in 1995, operates clandestinely and publishes its reports outside the country. Founded in 1992, the Oromo Ex-Prisoners For Human Rights similarly continued to function in a perilous clandestinity.   Freedom of Assembly   Under Ethiopian law, organizers of political meetings and demonstrations are required only to notify the competent government authorities prior to convening an event. The government managed, however, to restrict freedom of assembly by introducing a de facto permit system by virtue of which it stalled in acknowledging notifications and declared events which went ahead anyway as illegal, and therefore subject to dispersal and the arrest of participants. The government required some of those it arrested for taking part in political meetings and anti-government demonstrations, such as the 1997 demonstrations in Addis Ababa by shopkeepers and students, to submit written statements admitting their participation in an illegal activity, promising not to repeat the act, and praying for its pardon to be released. With threats of unspecified punishments hanging over their heads, the detained demonstrators all submitted to this humiliating ritual, which in addition implied that they would forfeit their constitutional right of peaceful assembly.   The Judicial System   In the face of an all-dominant party and powerful executive branch, victims of abuses had no redress. The restructuring of the judiciary, which had already suffered sweeping political purges in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Derg, has led to further pressure on its meager capacities, resulting in its near paralysis. Despite significant government efforts to reform the judiciary and ease its bottlenecks, judges who try to uphold the rule of law are frequently defeated by local officials who refuse to comply.   The Council of Peoples' Representatives initiated preparations in 1996 for the establishment of a human rights commission and ombudsman institution to fill in some of the gaps in the rights protection regime. By the end of 1997, no concrete steps in that direction had as yet been taken. The credibility of the new police force, which was meant to be established under civilian control, and made accountable before the law, suffered serious setbacks following the role of the police in some troubling political cases, particularly the killing in May 1997 of Assefa Maru. The """"Derg Trials"""": In 1994, Human Rights Watch published """"Reckoning Under the Law,"""" detailing the process of accountability for officials of the Derg who committed atrocities. By the third quarter of 1997, the trials on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity of the seventy-two top-ranking Derg officials, including Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had fled to Zimbabwe shortly before the fall of Addis Ababa to the EPRDF, were still pending. As for the majority of those detained in relation to their suspected role during the Derg dictatorship, it was only in the first quarter of 1997 that the Special Prosecutor's Office announced they had been charged with criminal offences. The Office charged a total of 5,198 people, of whom 2,246 were already in detention, while 2,952 were charged in absentia. The vast majority of the defendants were charged with genocide and war crimes, and alternatively charged with aggravated homicide and wilful injury. Many of the defendants were in pre-trial detention for almost six years before they were brought to court.   The Role of the International Community   Ethiopian government officials frequently made statements that equated the expression of human rights concerns by representatives of the international community with interference in the internal affairs of the country. In any case, Ethiopia's partners in the international community gave mixed signals. They considered the country a model of economic reforms, and strategic ally both for the stabilization of the Horn of Africa region and for the diplomatic and military containment of perceived threats from the Islamist government of neighboring Sudan. This led to firm commitments of aid, and less resolve as to the conditioning of that aid on human rights improvements and sound governance benchmarks. Five years into this strategic alliance, concerned representatives of the international community still had no focal point to which they could bring their queries about abuses, and their appeals were rarely answered.   Recommendations   To the Ethiopian Government   Abide by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and the international human rights instruments to which Ethiopia is party, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, taking measures to this effect to:  guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all Ethiopians currently in detention, and immediately release those illegally detained; put an end to the practice of illegal or arbitrary detention as well as ill-treatment or torture of detainees and extrajudicial executions; guarantee the independence of the judiciary as required by the Ethiopian constitution and international law. Particularly, allocate sufficient financial resources to the judiciary, ensure the proper training of judges and others involved in the administration of justice, and hold police and other officials who interfere with the independence of the judiciary or refuse to obey court orders accountable before the law; respect freedom of association, by immediately lifting all legal and bureaucratic obstacles hindering the registration of existing and new nongovernmental organizations; cease the arbitrary detention and harassment of activists in nonviolent civil organizations. Stop all unlawful attacks on these organizations in the form of raids against their offices and projects, confiscation of their property, and freezing of their bank accounts; respect freedom of assembly, by lifting restrictions on political meetings and public demonstrations imposed by law and in practice, and halting arbitrary police actions to ban and disperse such meetings and demonstrations; respect freedom of expression, by lifting arbitrary restrictions on the print and public broadcasting media; and ceasing the detention and imprisonment of journalists for the expression of their opinions; respect academic freedom, by removing all restrictions on faculty and students' rights to associate and assemble; recognize the rights of Ethiopian human rights defenders to monitor, investigate, and report on human rights abuses in the country; and their rights to associate with others nationally and internationally in pursuit of the promotion of human rights and their protection in the country.  Establish a civilian, accountable police force, and strengthen the training of its personnel on issues of due process of law and on human rights standards and protections. To that effect:  conduct an independent inquiry into the killing of Assefa Maru, executive committee member of both the Ethiopian Teachers Association and the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, at the hands of police officers; investigate all other allegations of police abuse and improper treatment of detained persons; hold police officials responsible for such abuses accountable before the law. Establish a permanent human rights commission which is genuinely independent of the government, empowering it to: monitor and report on compliance with the human rights standards enshrined in the domestic legal system and the international instruments to which Ethiopia is party; establish its own priorities, which should include investigating reports of violations of the right to life and security of the person, and the right to freedom from torture and arbitrary arrest and detention; submit findings to judicial bodies so that perpetrators, including those within the security forces, are brought to justice; ensure that victims of abuses receive the adequate remedies that their cases call for, including protection for witnesses appearing before it and compensation for and rehabilitation of victims of abuses perpetrated by security forces.  To the International Community   Human Rights Watch urges members of the international community to press the government of Ethiopia to implement the above recommendations, in particular by using their economic support to the country to induce and to facilitate tangible human rights improvements. In particular:  support efforts by organizations of civil society to promote human rights standards and monitor government's compliance; target assistance to the judiciary in order to improve its capacity and encourage its independence; encourage the establishment of a permanent independent human rights commission through the extension of financial and technical support.","Africa, Ethiopia",""

December 8, 1997 His Excellency Mahdi Ibrahim Mohamed Ambassador of the Republic of Sudan to the U.S. 2210 Massachusetts Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20008 fax 202-667-2406 RE: Women in Sudan on Human Rights Day Your Excellency:  It is with deep concern that Human Rights Watch has received reports of the imminent execution on December 10, 1997 internationally celebrated as Human Rights Day of four women convicted of prostitution in Khartoum. We urge your government to refrain from executing these women because doing so would violate international and U.N. human rights standards. Under these circumstances, imposing the death penalty on four women on international Human Rights Day would make a mockery of human rights. We also protest the detention, beating and flogging of another group of women who were demonstrating in Khartoum, in the exercise of their right of free expression. This penalty was carried out at 1:00 a.m. on December 2, 1997, within twenty-four hours of their arrests. We urge you to compensate the arrested women, to repeal the penalty of flogging, and to assure that future peaceful protests proceed undisturbed. The abolition of the death penalty is desirable and strongly suggested in article 6 (right to life) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to the U.N. Human Rights Committee (General Comment 6, Article 6 (Sixteenth session, 1982), Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N. Doc. HRI\GEN\1\Rev.1 at 6 (1994)). In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, the sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime, under Section 6 (2) of the ICCPR. What such serious crimes are is further defined in section 1 of the U.N. Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty (E.S.C. res. 1984/50, annex, 1984 U.N. ESCOR Supp. (No. 1) at 33, U.N. Doc. E/1984/84 (1984)):  In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being understood that their scope should not go beyond intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences.  In section 154 of the 1991 Criminal Act, prostitution is a crime, but purchasing the services of a prostitute is not. Therefore it strains logic to conclude that the drafters of the 1991 Criminal Act considered prostitution to have the very serious """"lethal or other extremely grave consequences"""" required to impose the death penalty. Imposing the death penalty for prostitution, a crime for which the death penalty was not prescribed by law at the time of its commission, is a violation of the U.N. Safeguards, section 2. A press account states that the four were found guilty under the 1983 Criminal Act. It is our understanding that the 1983 Act had been superseded by the 1991 Criminal Act. In section 154 of the 1991 Act, prostitution is not a crime punishable by death. The death penalty (or life imprisonment) is provided only in section 155, for the related crime of """"running a place for prostitution,"""" and then only after three convictions of the crime of running a house of prostitution. We are also concerned that the convicted women may not have enjoyed the necessary safeguards in the course of their trial and sentencing. Section 4 of the U.N. safeguards states, """"Capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts."""" We also are concerned that the four women may not have had adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings, as required under section 5 of the U.N. safeguards.  The haste of the appeal a mere fifteen days according to the press account violates the intent and letter of sections 6 and 7 of the U.N. safeguards, which provide for a right to appeal and a right to seek pardon or commutation of sentence. Fifteen days is not sufficient time, even in a country with an efficient communications infrastructure, to make the appeal or seek pardon. And Sudan does not now have efficient communications: many government officials working in the justice system have emphasized to us the difficulty of routine tasks such as making copies of files, on account of lack of resources and other reasons.  We are shocked that the death penalty is even contemplated in the case of the four women convicted of prostitution. In our meetings with government officials, we were assured that the death penalty, although on the books, is sparingly applied in Sudan, that the Sudanese culture does not tolerate the kind of excessive use of the death penalty as seen in other countries. We also note that the other cases of imposition of the death penalty seem to have been for intentional, lethal crimes, such as the killings of worshipers at the Ansar al Sunna mosque in 1994. Human Rights Watch opposes all executions under law because of the inherent cruelty of the death penalty, the inherent fallibility of all criminal justice systems, and the irreversibility of executions. Even if we did not oppose the death penalty, the imposition of the death penalty as contemplated in the case of these four prostitutes would be a grave miscarriage of justice. The factual information about the death penalty cases was contained in the report of a journalist based in Khartoum whose work has been accurate in the past, quoting the government news service and interviews with several government officials. [Nhial Bohl, """"Prostitutes Sentenced to Death,"""" IPS, Khartoum, November 25, 1997.]  The case of the women peace demonstrators is troubling as well. According to usually reliable sources, the women were detained on December 1, 1997, after presenting a petition to U.N. representatives in Khartoum. This same petition, in opposition to military conscription of boys between sixteen and eighteen years, had already been presented to the Parliament, where the matter had already been raised by at least one member of Parliament. The entire group of about fifty women demonstrators were said to be carrying two banners, """"Yes for Democracy,"""" and """"Stop the Forced Conscription of Students."""" They were peacefully demonstrating in front of the UNDP headquarters when the security forces arrived. According to a report of the U.N., """"the women, including the elderly, were brutally assaulted with sticks and rubber hoses and slapped on their faces by police and security officers. The women were arrested and dragged into police vehicles. The assault of the women was witnessed by a large number of UN staff members who had gathered at the gate"""" of the U.N. compound. One, Samera Talib Ismael, is said to have suffered a broken arm and another, Sarah Hamd Elneil is said to be suffering from internal bleeding and in critical condition and is still hospitalized. Some of the injured were taken to a hospital where they were roughly bandaged, but then promptly sent to join the rest of the group for trial.  We were informed that several lawyers attempted to represent the women, but they were not permitted to have individual counsel. One advocate, Mustapha Abdel Gadir, protested to the judge because of the medical condition of the most seriously injured young woman. This led to the women being sent back to the hospital and the advocate being fined 500,000 Sudanese pounds (about $300 US). In all thirty-seven women were said to have been arrested, the oldest being sixty-seven years old. Among them were lawyers, university lecturers, medical personnel, political activists, and others. We understand that they were tried by Judge Mohamed Sir El Khatim Gharabawi in a public order court, and convicted. Of these, all were fined and the younger women (reports disagree on the number, which ranges from twelve to twenty-six women) were sentenced to lashing as well. The penalties were carried out on the spot, and these women received ten lashes each, with the exception of Lelyan Mohamed Salih Hussein, who was wearing trousers and consequently received an additional thirty lashes. At 1:00 a.m. the lashings were complete and the fines paid, and all were released, but an advocate Mustafa Abdel Gadir, was forced to spend the night in jail, being regarded as in contempt of court. This punishment of the exercise of the right of free expression violates human rights on several counts. First, there should be no abridgement of free expression, and demonstrating by walking on the streets together, carrying banners and presenting a petition to authorities are forms of expression. The women protested compulsory military service for boys between sixteen and eighteen: according to one press account, a government spokesman noted that none of them had a relative who was a conscript. This is irrelevant. They are entitled to have an opinion on the draft and the war whether or not they are directly affected. No one demands that those attending rallies to support the government and the war have a relative in the armed forces or militia. The pro-government demonstrators number in the thousands. Why cannot the government tolerate a small opposition demonstration by one hundred women? The beatings administered by the police and security forces at the time of arrest violate international police norms. The medical assistance rendered those injured by the police and security forces appears to have been inadequate, especially in view of the account of the sickness of one woman in the courtroom. Flogging is a violation of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: """"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment...."""" Flogging is a punishment usually associated with slavery. Flogging is for this reason and others degrading treatment, regardless of who is flogged. We were even more disturbed to learn of reports that the flogging was administered by women prisoners in jail for other crimes. This violates the rights of those other women prisoners, as set forth in U.N. guidelines: """"No prisoner shall be employed, in the service of the institution, in any disciplinary capacity."""" (Section 28 (1), Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted Aug. 30, 1955 by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, U.N. Doc. A/CONF/611, annex I, E.S.C. res. 663C, 24 U.N. ESCOR Supp. (No. 1) at 11, U.N. Doc. E/3048 (1957), amended E.S.C. res. 2076, 62 U.N. ESCOR Supp. (No. 1) at 35, U.N. Doc. E/5988 (1977).  Finally, we condemn the continued mistreatment of the advocate Mustafa Abdel Gadir. He has been subjected to numerous arrests and beatings, all related to the practice of his profession and his attempts to represent clients that the government dislikes. In conclusion, we urge you to refrain from executing the four women reportedly sentenced to death for prostitution and to abolish the death penalty. We also urge you to compensate the women who have been beaten and flogged, and punish those responsible. We further urge you to permit all further peaceful protests to proceed without fear of arrest or ill-treatment, and to remove cruel, inhuman and degrading penalties from the penal code. These measures are necess ary to demonstrate respect for human right s.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/12/03/human-rights-watch-world-report-1998","Human Rights Watch World Report 1998","Human Rights Watch World Report 1998","","12/03/1997","The universality of human rights -- the fundamental premise that they apply to all nations without exception -- came under sustained attack in 1997.   With the economic crisis in Asia, the invocation of """"Asian values"""" to justify repression lost much of its resonance, but the marked tendency of the major powers to ignore human rights when they proved inconvenient to economic or strategic interests posed a growing threat to universality. This failing, common to both Europe and the United States, was seen most vividly in relations with China and Central Africa. In addition, the U.S. government actively obstructed the strengthening of international human rights standards and institutions and remained unwilling to permit the application of existing international standards at home. This U.S. arrogance suggests that in Washington's view, human rights standards should be embraced only if they codify what the U.S. government already does, not what the United States ought to achieve. Fortunately, a new coalition of small and medium-sized states from the North and the South, working closely with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), has begun to fill this breech in the defense of human rights. In the Human Rights Watch World Report 1998, released today, Human Rights Watch finds that in the past year, the U.S. government actively obstructed the emergence of human rights standards in three significant areas: landmines, child soldiers and the International Criminal Court (ICC).  While some one hundred governments prepared to sign an historic ban on anti-personnel landmines, the Clinton administration sought to weaken the ban with exceptions. The U.S. government is unwilling to join the ban because of a desire to use landmines in Korea and to exempt certain types of self-destructing """"smart"""" mines. But scores of governments are willing to accept the military inconvenience of abandoning landmines in the interest of a strong international norm that would curtail their terrible humanitarian cost. The Pentagon's refusal to embrace the ban reflects its unwillingness to change its conduct even in light of evolving international humanitarian standards. The U.S. stands virtually alone in opposing a ban on the use of children under eighteen as soldiers. The ban would end a practice that leaves the children -- as many as 250,000 worldwide -- physically at risk, emotionally traumatized, and a danger to anyone they encounter. Only about one-half of one percent of the U.S. military is composed of recruits under the age of eighteen. The U.S. maintains its opposition even though the ban would be attached as an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty which the U.S. has not even ratified. On the International Criminal Court, the U.S. government has insisted on various restrictions that would weaken the ICC's independence and effectiveness as a deterrent to tyrants everywhere. Illustrative is a proposed requirement that the U.N. Security Council approve most prosecutions, which would allow those with veto power on the Security Council to block any inconvenient prosecution. The goal appears to be avoiding even the remotest possibility that an American might end up in the dock. But the insistence on an effective U.S. exception -- one that the other four permanent members of the Security Council were quick to demand for themselves -- undermines the universality on which any international system of justice must be built.  Human Rights Watch asserts that it is time for the international community to stop indulging this obstructionist behavior. If the U.S. government persists in its dismissive posture toward international human rights law, the international community should simply leave the United States behind. As it did in the case of landmines, the international community should, if necessary, move ahead without the U.S. to adopt a ban on child soldiers and create a strong, independent ICC. Selective Commitment to Human Rights by the Major Powers: China was the single greatest beneficiary of this selective commitment, as the international community grappled with how to exert human rights pressure on a repressive country that is also a key trading partner. Some countries seemed more concerned with how to strike deals than how to protect human rights. Nowhere was this more evident than at the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva: France, Germany, Spain and Italy capitulated to China's commercial seduction by trading the usual European Union sponsorship of a U.N. resolution critical of China's human rights practices for the prospect of more Chinese purchases of their jointly produced Airbus planes. These governments did not rise to the defense of their fellow E.U. members when China retaliated, especially against Denmark and the Netherlands, for sponsoring the resolution and speaking in favor of it. Japan, Canada and Australia abandoned their traditional sponsorship of the U.N. resolution in return for a toothless bilateral human rights """"dialogue."""" Although the U.S. did sponsor the U.N. resolution on China, it waffled so long, and lobbied its allies for support so ineffectively, that the result seemed more a cosmetic gesture than a genuine effort to censure China.  In the past, China has responded to pressure when its human rights practices were clearly linked to something of concern to Beijing. There are ample opportunities for such linkage today: China's admission to the World Trade Organization, World Bank loans, and future dates for summits with world leaders. But the U.S. government in particular has obstructed debate over appropriate linkages by speaking in terms of a false dichotomy between """"isolation"""" and """"engagement"""" of China and rebutting a largely fictitious demand to hold the entire relationship with China """"hostage"""" to human rights.  Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to stop such obfuscation and link some significant aspect of relations with China to Beijing taking structural steps that will lead to substantial improvements in human rights, such as: granting humanitarian organizations access to prisons; opening all of China and Tibet to scrutiny by independent journalists and human rights monitors; or, releasing the many nonviolent offenders among the 2,000 prisoners serving time for """"counterrevolution,"""" a crime which no longer exists.  A New Challenge to Human Rights in Central Africa: A number of African leaders challenged the universality of human rights principles under the slogan of """"African solutions to African problems."""" They argued that deviations from human rights standards, including tight control on speech, assembly and association and democratic institutions, are temporarily necessary to rebuild nations recently liberated from highly repressive regimes. Policymakers in Europe and North America provided a disappointingly weak response to this theory. This thin cover for repression has found favor in the new generation of leaders in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the DRC and Rwanda, where thousands of civilians were murdered in the course of conflict in 1997, leaders did not challenge the validity of international humanitarian law prohibiting such slaughter. Instead, they tried to conceal the extent of the killings by impeding independent investigation of the crimes. At the same time, they argued that the killings were justified in the context of overthrowing a tyrant in the DRC and combating forces responsible for the genocide of 1994 and now waging war again in Rwanda. European and North American governments, while pressing for investigation of recent killings, seemed eager to build political relationships with and send economic assistance to these governments, despite their failure to hold abusive members of their security forces accountable for their crimes. U.S. officials, in particular, repeatedly downplayed the role of Rwandan troops in the slaughter. Bosnia and Rwanda: The International Criminal Tribunals: Significant progress was made in 1997 toward securing justice before international tribunals for those behind the genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But this experiment with international justice remained at risk because President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and French President Jacques Chirac refused to order their troops in SFOR to arrest the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Of the seventy-eight war crimes suspects known to have been indicted by the Yugoslavia tribunal, twenty are in custody awaiting trial, six are known or believed to be dead, and fifty-two are at large, primarily in Serbia or Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia. In July, British troops arrested a secretly indicted Bosnian Serb suspect in Prijedor and killed another in a firefight, making it clear that NATO was fully capable of """"encountering"""" indicted war criminals when it chose to. Despite NATO's predictions, there was no serious retaliation against NATO troops or other international workers. After July, however, various NATO governments offered one excuse after another for not pursuing further arrests. Above all, the U.S. military leadership remains determined to avoid any risk to American soldiers, regardless of the stakes involved. It is also disappointing that Britain, France, and their European allies -- which had already incurred casualties in the interest of establishing peace in Bosnia -- were so deferential to Washington's excessive fear of casualties when it came to building the justice system necessary to keep that peace. A New Set of Actors Comes to the Fore: Fortunately, as the most powerful governments wavered in their defense of human rights, a new set of actors, both governmental and nongovernmental, came to the fore. A defiant coalition of small and medium-sized states from the North and the South overcame obstructive major powers, including the U.S., to draft a new anti-personnel landmines treaty, due for signature in Ottawa by more than one hundred governments on December 3 and 4. Campaigns to create a strong, independent ICC are gaining strength in many countries around the world, despite the active opposition of the permanent five members of the Security Council. Other NGO efforts include attempts to hold multinational corporations to human rights standards, to continue integrating women's rights into the human rights agenda, and to secure the arrest of indicted war criminals. With the model of their successful landmines campaign in mind, these new coalitions could assume important leadership roles by insisting on the principle of universality and a strong defense of human rights when the commitment of the major powers is lacking. Human Rights and the United Nations: The election of Kofi Annan as U.N. secretary-general and his appointment of Mary Robinson as U.N. high commissioner for human rights gave a tremendous boost to those who look to the United Nations to play a leadership role on human rights issues. While Kofi Annan spoke frequently and forcefully on human rights in 1997, the one significant disappointment during his first year was his capitulation to the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in removing Roberto Garret¢n as head of the U.N.'s investigation into the massacre of tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees as they fled across northern Congo. This breeched the fundamental principle that abusive governments should not be allowed to select the investigators of their conduct -- a precedent that came back to haunt the U.N. in Iraq. The U.N. granted further concessions in the DRC on the timing of the investigations, the investigators' access to certain Congolese witnesses, and the investigators' ability to recommend prosecutions. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights is crippled by its own indifference to the human rights record of its membership. Commission members include not only countries that routinely flout basic human rights, such as China, Belarus and Rwanda, but even countries that refuse to permit U.N. special rapporteurs to conduct on-site investigations, such as Cuba. Human Rights Watch calls for an end to the charade that permits abusive governments to join the U.N.'s highest human rights body for the principal purpose of shielding their own conduct from criticism and enfeebling the U.N.'s capacity to defend human rights. Restrictions on Refugee Rights and Religious Persecution:Human Rights Watch also decries a growing determination among powerful governments to shed their responsibility toward refugees. Illustrative were a U.S. law authorizing the use of summary procedures to evaluate the claims of many asylum seekers and a European Union rule allowing the rejection of asylum claims if the applicant had passed through a """"safe third country."""" The report describes at length various forms of religion that faced persecution around the world. The persecution of Christians received heightened scrutiny in the United States in 1997. The report demonstrates that a broad array of religious minorities face persecution, and that the persecution comes in a wide variety of forms not currently addressed by legislation pending in the U.S. Congress. Attacks on Human Rights Monitors: In apparent retaliation for their work, fifteen human rights monitors were killed, forcibly """"disappeared,"""" or died in suspicious circumstances in 1997. This was more than double the toll in 1996, with all but one of the victims in Colombia or Rwanda. Many other human rights monitors faced detention or harassment. The Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 is our eighth annual summary and is released in anticipation of International Human Rights Day on December 10. The report is a review of human rights practices in sixty-five countries, and covers events from December 1996 through November 1997. Most chapters examine significant human rights developments in a particular country; the response of global actors, such as the United States, the European Union, Japan, the United Nations, and various regional organizations; and restrictions on human rights monitoring.","Global",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/12/01/communal-violence-west-kalimantan","Communal Violence in West Kalimantan","Communal Violence in West Kalimantan","","12/01/1997","The Indonesian government made a series of serious missteps leading to human rights violations in its handling of one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic conflict the country has seen in decades, according to a new report, Communal Violence in West Kalimantan, released today by Human Rights Watch/Asia.   The new report, issued as the first anniversary of the violence approaches, documents the conflict that erupted in late 1996 and early 1997 between indigenous Dayak people and immigrants from the island of Madura who settled in the province of West Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo site of the forest fires that are currently wreaking environmental havoc across Southeast Asia. Based on investigations in the province in January and July, the report gives a lower death toll than most previous accounts, documenting about 500 deaths rather than 1,000 or higher as was initially reported. It notes that major questions remain unanswered almost a year later about how the conflict spread and about army and police actions that may have exacerbated the conflict. The report itself does not come to any conclusion about a central question: whether the worst of the violence was spontaneous or manipulated. Human Rights Watch does state, however, that in two short visits, it was unable to find any hard evidence of provocateurs. Instead, it outlines the kind of information that would have to be collected before such a judgment can be made and stresses the importance of a thorough and impartial investigation if another round of violence is to be avoided. One year later, the situation remains explosive.   Human Rights Watch argues that human rights violations, including summary executions and arbitrary detention, took place in the course of the conflict, and those violations have served to increase distrust of the government on the part of the two ethnic groups involved. Many Madurese also believe the police failed to protect them from attacks because of a history of bad blood stemming from the death in police custody of a Madurese in 1993 that led to a retaliatory secaking of police stations in the provincial capital, Pontianak. The armed forces committed several extrajudicial executions of Dayak youths in the course of military operations to prevent Dayak groups from attacking Madurese settlements. The use of force, and in some cases of lethal force, may have been necessary to prevent those attacks, but the executions in question occurred when the youths were effectively in custody. In the aftermath of the conflict, several dozen Madurese and Dayaks were arbitrarily detained on the basis of an anachronistic emergency regulation from 1951.   The report states that government controls on information, including restrictions on journalists, prevented facts from emerging which might have helped curb some of the rumors that fuelled the conflict. It also notes that the National Human Rights Commission, a government-appointed body that has acted courageously and independently in the past, did not try to pursue an investigation beyond an initial visit or even try to ascertain an accurate death toll on the grounds that to delve too deeply into the violence might make things worse. Finally, it notes that the """"peace pacts"""" engineered by the government to bring Madurese and Dayaks leaders together at the subdistrict and district level were misconceived, as the leaders in question were often closer to the ruling party, Golkar, than they were to the communities where the violence was rooted.   The report examines three explanations for the conflict, cultural, economic, and political. The cultural explanation looks at the history of conflict between the two groups and the radically different approaches to resolving disputes. The economic explanation looks at the increasing marginalization of the Dayak people as their land has been taken for commercial ventures. The political looks at various theories of political manipulation -- who, if anyone, had an interest in seeing conflict break out. The report notes that the violence may well have been a combination of all three factors. The important task is to understand the dynamics of this outbreak particularly as tensions remain so high than another eruption is not just possible but likely.   The report states that it is also essential that the larger questions about how the Dayak people have fared under New Order development policies be addressed. On the basis of its research, Human Rights Watch does not believe that the virulence of this communal conflict can be blamed entirely on the socioeconomic frustrations of a dispossessed people, but those frustrations, it says, are very real and cannot be ignored.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Rather, the rights group called for aid to be linked to carefully calibrated benchmarks and based on an ongoing evaluation of human rights and democratization criteria. """"The risk here is that donors will find themselves in the same position they were in under the Mobutu regime,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Africa. """"They are getting ready to contribute to the bank accounts of a regime that is violating basic human rights and has shown no commitment to democracy."""" Donors can best achieve their goal of political stability in central Africa by continuing to demand accountability for the massive slaughter of civilians that took place as President Laurent Desir‚ Kabila came to power and by insisting that the new government respect human rights and the rule of law. Attempting to buy stability by unconditioned infusions of bilateral and multilateral aid will only encourage the DRC government to continue its policies of repression, its politics of exclusion, and its rule by force. The continuation of these practices will lead to further bloodshed, as was shown by the military killings in the last few days, and in the devastation of the social and economic infrastructure built with foreign assistance. The DRC government has both violated basic human rights and has hindered the U.N. investigation into the mass killing of civilians. Since May 1997, the Kinshasa authorities have successfully resisted international pressure, including numerous interventions by U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to let the investigation move forward. The same authorities deny the basic rights of Congolese and make little progress towards establishing a democratic state. In many parts of the country, they have engaged in brutal and arbitrary arrests of those whom they regard as political opponents and defenders of human rights. They have banned political activity by parties other than Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) and they named only ADFL members to a commission recently created to draft Congo's new constitution. They have restricted freedom of association and freedom of assembly, and have threatened journalists, human rights activists, and members of the political opposition. On November 25, for example, a leader of an opposition party was arrested after giving a press conference critical of the Kabila government. A group of ten journalists, including members of the international press corps, who had attended the conference, were also detained and whipped by police. They have warned organizations of civil society development NGOs, churches, human rights groups and others that they should expect to play only a limited role in reconstructing and re-defining the new Congo, despite their Herculean efforts over the past several years to serve the population of the decaying Zairian state. During the last years of the Mobutu regime, the European Union and other donors brought hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance to the Congolese population through international and national organizations of civil society, while avoiding government bank accounts. Human Rights Watch urges the European Union, the United States, and other donors to continue this practice until the human rights record of the current government improves. In this way, donors may assist the people without backing their repressive leaders. Human Rights Watch called on donors to make bilateral and multilateral assistance to the central government contingent upon: 1) demonstrable and tangible progress in the field investigative phase of the U.N. Investigative Team and ultimately in bringing the perpetrators of the massacres to justice; and 2) improved respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic principles by the Congolese government. The latter would include measures such as lifting the ban on political activity; guaranteeing the participation of organizations of the Congolese civil society in the reconstruction and re-defining of the new Congo; ceasing harassment of independent voices among the political opposition, media, and civil society; and a clear commitment to holding the military accountable for human rights abuses. Periodic evaluation and monitoring to ensure that benchmarks in these areas are met will be essential to guarantee that financial aid is well spent and is not serving to reinforce repressive practices, as was the case under Mobutu. In order to discourage future rounds of massive civilian slaughter in the region, it will be particularly important to progressively monitor the Congolese government's cooperation with the U.N. investigation and subsequent efforts to bring to justice those implicated in crimes against humanity. Further bilateral aid, such as balance of payments support, should be contingent upon the progressive implementation of institutional and legal reforms to guarantee respect for human rights. Human Rights Watch fears that the opportunity to have positive influence on Congo during its formative stages may be missed. Only a firm and consistent policy on human rights and the rule of law will limit abuses by those with military power and encourage those who are struggling to rebuild their societies. To do otherwise risks creating the same destructive alliance that the West held with former President Mobutu; namely, contributing to the bank accounts of a corrupt government that trampled on the rights of its citizens and destabilized the region.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

Although they have not been charged, the government has publicly accused them of having links to the rebel Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), and of involvement in bombings that took place in the capital Addis Ababa earlier this year. Eight of the detainees are members of the board of directors of the Human Rights League, a human rights monitoring and education group established in December 1996 by members of the Oromo community in Addis Ababa. Despite constitutional provisions guaranteeing the freedom of association, the government failed to grant the League the legal status it has applied for since its inception. The full text of the letter follows. November 18, 1997 His Excellency Meles Zenawi Prime Minister Office P.O. Box 1031 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Fax: 251-1-552-030 Your Excellency, We are writing to express our concern about the detention without charge of prominent members of the Oromo community. Our information indicates that the following individuals and others remain in detention at the Central Investigation Bureau of the police since their arrests in the first week of November: Beyene Abdi Beyene Belissa Hussein Abdi Haji Sahlu Kebte Gabissa Lemessa Tilahun Hirpasa Zewde Chmada Addisu Beyene Garoma Bekele Adam Hassan Adungna Fitee Mohamed Wayu Gadissa Boltossa Although they were not officially charged, your government has accused them publicly of being members of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), and of involvement in the recent bombings that took place in Addis Ababa and other urban centers.  The first eight named above reportedly are members of the board of directors of the Human Rights League, established among the Oromo in Addis Ababa in December 1996. Garoma Bekele is the secretary general of the League. Notwithstanding constitutional guarantees of freedom of association, and broad provisions for the protection of fundamental human rights in the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, your government has not granted the league the legal status it, applied for at its inception, despite its compliance with all legal requirements. Addissu Beyene is the former chairman of Oromo Relief Organization (ORA) that the government dissolved in August 1995, after publicly accusing it of having links with the OLF. Although this specific allegation was never brought before a court of law, a number of ORA workers were harassed and arbitrarily detained.  The Human Rights League's objectives, according to its brochure, are to provide human rights education, monitor and report on human rights abuses, and provide legal aid to victims of violations. It is ironic, therefore, that eight members of its board and its only full-time staff member are now held incommunicado, apparently for their human rights activities. They are reportedly denied access to their families and doctors. The denial of access to personal physicians raises grave concerns for the well-being of elderly board members, particularly Tilahun Tirpassa, Hussein Abdi, Beyene Belissa and other elderly detainees requiring medical care. Eyewitnesses stated they saw Beyene Belissa, who is disabled, being dragged by policemen into a court house for a court appearance on November 11 where the detainees were remanded in custody. Police reportedly smashed both his operational and artificial legs during his arrest. We are also concerned about the notoriously harsh detention conditions at the Central Investigation Bureau and the reports of ill-treatment of those held there. We urge your government to free immediately these detainees and others held in any security detention or to charge them with a crime in a regular criminal court. We urge your government to respect the physical and mental integrity of detainees and to give their families, doctors and lawyers immediate access to them.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/11/17/liberias-human-rights-situation-precarious","Liberias Human Rights Situation Precarious","Liberia's Human Rights Situation Precarious","","11/17/1997","(New York) - While the end of the war has brought much-needed peace and security, Liberia's state institutions and economy have been destroyed. In """"Emerging from the Destruction: Human Rights Challenges Facing the New Liberian Government,"""" released today, Human Rights Watch finds the human rights situation to be precarious. A culture of violence, ethnic tension and impunity has taken root, and the next steps by the new government will determine whether Liberia will emerge from the chaos that marked its recent history. Human Rights Watch identifies the key challenges facing the administration of President Charles Taylor, and calls for sustained attention to human rights during this critical transition period.   """"Four months after taking office, President Taylor is facing enormous challenges in rebuilding a country that was virtually destroyed by the warring factions,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"But if Liberia is to successfully reconcile and rebuild, this government will need to prioritize institution-building and protection of human rights. Our report provides an analysis of the current situation and offers detailed recommendations which, if followed by the relevant government and international agencies, will lay the basis for long-term peace and development.""""   According to Human Rights Watch, this transition period provides a rare opportunity to develop new state institutions that can operate to secure respect for human rights. While President Taylor has promised to uphold human rights and has taken some initial steps, Human Rights Watch believes that more must be done, particularly to ensure the safe and voluntary return of the one million refugees and internally displaced, to rebuild the law enforcement and justice institutions, and to deal with past abuses of human rights.   The Taylor government came into office on August 2, 1997 following an election that ended a seven-year civil war. Tens of thousands of Liberians were killed during the war and almost half the country's population displaced. Despite the presence of regional peacekeepers and a United Nations military observer mission, fighting resumed numerous times during the war, and the number of factions proliferated over the years. All the factions, including Charles Taylor's faction, were responsible for terrorizing the local populations in order to loot and to discourage support for rival factions. Widespread atrocities against civilians were committed including killings, torture, forced labor, and extortion.   The Human Rights Watch report recommends to the Taylor government that it pay particular attention to the following human rights issues in the rebuilding process: &nbsp&nbsp&nbspReturn of Refugees and the Internally Displaced. In order for the one million refugees and internally displaced Liberians to return home, Human Rights Watch recommends that the Liberian government actively extend political assurances of safety and provide material assistance. The voluntary return of the refugees will be assisted by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, once they return, they will require government assistance to rebuild their homes and community institutions to become self-sufficient. While most will be able to return home, some will face difficulties that the government must address. Some returnees may find their homes occupied. In other cases, refugee from ethnic or political groups previously targeted by Taylor's warring faction, may fear persecution or be unwilling to return. The organized return of refugees and the internally displaced should not be called for by the government or UNHCR until the political situation stabilizes further and some basic services are restored inside the country. Although international assistance will be extended to refugees, there is much less assistance available to those internally displaced. Thousands of internally displaced are living in squalid conditions, particularly in the greater Monrovia area. The Liberian government body tasked with the responsibility of returning the refugee and internally displaced, the Liberia Refugee, Repatriation and Resettlement Commission, remains under funded and virtually non-functional. This body needs to be given the funding and the authority to design programs that can return people to their homes.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbspRebuilding State Institutions Human Rights Watch calls on the government to streamline, screen and reconstitute the Ministry of Justice, the courts, the police, the security forces and the prison administration to guarantee greater accountability and respect for human rights. The report calls on the government to resist the pressure to reward former faction fighters responsible for gross violations of human rights by giving them government jobs in the new army or police force. In addition to hiring and training qualified personnel, the government should create an independent oversight commission with the authority to monitor and investigate abuses by police and security forces. In a commendable move, the government recently created a Commission on Human Rights. This welcome step must be followed by government support for the work of the commission. The commission will require sufficient funding, authority, and independence to investigate human rights complaints and to institute legal proceedings on behalf of victims of abuse of state power.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbspDealing with Past Abuses Having emerged from a situation of brutal conflict where civilians were overwhelmingly targeted by all factions, the government should take steps to hold those responsible for committing gross violations of human rights accountable for their crimes. The peace accords, that give immunity to faction fighters for abuses in the course of military action should not apply to atrocities against civilians. Where former combatants wantonly committed abuses against civilians, they should be held accountable in a court of law. Human Rights Watch calls on the government to create a Truth Commission, to collect testimony and evidence about the wrongs committed during the course of the war and publicly name those responsible for the acts. In dealing with past abuses, the government should pay special attention to the effects of the widespread sexual violence committed against women during the war, since the stigma attached to this crime and its under reported nature, often result in the after effects being overlooked. Women also continue to be subjected to discriminatory customary provisions which, among other things, prevent them from inheriting property. With a larger number of widows and female-headed households as a result of the war, Human Rights Watch urges the legislature to repeal such discriminatory provisions.  The process of demobilizing former fighters remains incomplete. Although some 21,315 of an estimated 33,000 have been disarmed, the chain of command in many places remains intact, posing a threat of renewed mobilization for political or criminal violence. Former fighters, particularly, child soldiers, need to be returned to their home areas and to be given schooling or vocational opportunities.   The Human Rights Watch report also calls on the international community to sustain its attention to the rebuilding attention in Liberia, and to make respect for human rights a condition of international aid and assistance. The regional peacekeeping operation and the U.N. Military Observer mission will depart shortly. Bilateral donors, the European Union, a small U.N. peace-building unit and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) will be playing a key role in the country. It is incumbent on the U.N., as well as bilateral donors and international nongovernmental groups, to ensure that human rights issues are the cornerstone of their program assistance to Liberia.","Africa, Liberia",""

""""This is very good news indeed,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, """"and a tribute both to the will and courage of a remarkable man and to the efforts of the Clinton administration, other governments, and concerned individuals around the world who worked for his release. It is deplorable, however, that the Chinese government remains so intolerant of dissent that Mr. Wei can only gain his freedom on the apparent condition that he go into exile.""""  Ms. Jones also stressed that the release of one man, however important, must not be seen as indicative of major human rights improvements in China. """"The timing of this release -- after President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington and before the Chinese Minister of Justice arrives in the U.S. -- suggests that it is a direct outcome of the summit. It is consistent with the hostage politik' that Chinese leaders have pursued since 1989: when they need to offer a concession for political reasons, they release someone they never should have arrested in the first place. When the political climate permits, they arrest a few more as bargaining chips for the next time around. In terms of the overall human rights situation, Mr. Wei's release changes little."""" Human Rights Watch points out that arbitrary detention of those who peacefully challenge the political system continues; that ill-treatment and denial of medical care for prisoners remains widespread; that outside access to China's enormous prison system remains banned; that Tibet remains virtually closed to foreign journalists and human rights monitors; that religious persecution persists; and that worker rights continue to be violated with impunity. """"We will continue to work for the release of all those unfairly detained in China,"""" said Ms. Jones. """"But as Mr. Wei himself will no doubt point out, the problem goes far beyond prisoners."""" At the time of his release, Wei Jingsheng was in the second year of a fourteen-year sentence for advocating democratic reform. It was the second lengthy sentence for the former electrician for the Beijing Zoo. Now forty-eight, he was first jailed in 1979 for his participation in the Democracy Wall movement. His now-famous essay, entitled """"The Fifth Modernization,"""" argued that in addition to four kinds of modernization advocated by Deng Xiaoping, China also needed democracy. That essay was followed by another calling Deng an autocrat. For these actions, Wei Jingsheng was sentenced on October 16, 1979 to fifteen years in jail, although he was formally accused of leaking state secrets and """"counterrevolutionary propaganda."""" As shown in the recently-published collection of his prison letters, entitled The Courage to Stand Alone, his treatment in prison was harsh. He spent long periods in solitary confinement, and his health deteriorated sharply. In late 1993, he was released in what was widely interpreted as an attempt by China to deflect human rights criticism in pursuit of its ultimately unsuccessful bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games. Wei immediately went back to advocating political reform, meeting with activists, journalists, and others, and writing for foreign and domestic publications. On April 1, he was again taken into custody and has been detained ever since. He was found guilty in his December 1995 trial of """"counterrevolution.""""

Nigeria's Endless Process of Transition to Civilian Rule, Human Rights Watch calls for Nigeria to be expelled from the Commonwealth, on the grounds that it has failed to meet the conditions set for membership by the Commonwealth Heads of Government in the Harare Declaration of 1991, and the Millbrook Action Programme of 1995.   The report is released to coincide with the first day of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh, at which Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth since 1995 is due to be reconsidered.    """"The transition program put in place by General Abacha is a sham,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Africa. """"The Commonwealth should not be fooled into believing that the Nigerian military is serious about its promise to hand over power to a civilian government. Nigeria has not taken any of the steps to avoid expulsion stipulated by the Commonwealth Heads of Government in 1995 when it was suspended from membership, and accordingly should be expelled.""""    Human Rights Watch further calls on the Commonwealth to extend the mandate of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and instruct CMAG to develop clear standards for the fulfillment of the principles of the Harare Declaration, which commits Commonwealth members to democratic political processes and respect for human rights and the rule of law. Human Rights Watch urges the international community to make clear to the Nigerian military regime that any transition program for the restoration of civilian government must fulfil certain minimum criteria before it can be deemed credible.    These minimum standards must include:  the creation of a genuinely independent electoral commission and the development of an open and fair process for the registration of political parties and candidates; the release of all political prisoners; the repeal of the most repressive military decrees and respect for freedom of expression and the media.  Transition or Travesty? examines the progress made by Nigeria in restoring civilian rule and respecting human rights during the two years since it was suspended from the Commonwealth. Human Rights Watch concludes that General Abacha has manipulated every aspect of the current transition program to ensure the success of his supporters, and perhaps even his own election as a """"civilian"""" president. The March 15, 1997 local government council elections, the most recent step in the transition process, were anything but free and fair. Many political prisoners held by the government in November 1995 remain incarcerated, including Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola, presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections. Human rights and pro-democracy activists, trade union leaders and outspoken journalists are harassed, arrested and detained, generally without charges, for prolonged periods. Nigerians having realized that the transition process is a sham, and facing an economy paralyzed by fuel shortages, macroeconomic mismanagement and preoccupied with providing for their families' basic needs, have abandoned hope that the transition program will make any difference to their lives.    As Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, said at a conference on Commonwealth human rights institutions in London on October 16, 1997, """"Nigeria has continued to assure us that it is attentive, but we are now waiting for action, not words.""""    Over the last two years, international criticism of Nigeria has become more muted. While sanctions imposed in 1993 and 1995 remain in place, governments have proved reluctant to take further concrete steps to show their disapproval of the military government. Human rights activists in Nigeria, however, are convinced as is Human Rights Watch that the situation in Nigeria would be far worse if these sanctions had not been imposed. Nigeria's international isolation should be maintained pending the installation of a civilian government elected following a genuinely free and fair transition program.","Africa, Nigeria",""

In Cold Storage: Super-maximum Security Confinement in Indiana, released today, Human Rights Watch concludes that confining mentally ill prisoners at the MCF and the SHU can cause such great suffering as to constitute torture under international human rights law. The Indiana Department of Corrections has the difficult job of securely housing disruptive or dangerous prisoners. But throwing them for years into the shocking conditions at the MCF and the SHU is beyond the pale,"""" states Jamie Fellner, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. Prisoners are sent to the MCF and the SHU after breaking rules at other prisons. More than half of the prisoners at the SHU are severely mentally ill and for these prisoners, conditions of confinement can be unbearable. Confined for twenty-two to twenty-three hours a day in small single cells, all prisoners at Indiana's super-maximum security prisons face extraordinary isolation, complete idleness, limited environmental stimulation and few educational or vocational opportunities. They are never allowed to touch their families; all visits are conducted behind plexiglass partitions while the prisoners are handcuffed and shackled. At both facilities but particularly at the MCF during its early years of operation prisoners have endured excessive physical violence including beatings and unnecessary forced """"cell extractions"""" carried out by teams of guards. After spending years shut off from each other and largely cut off from the outside world, many of these prisoners are abruptly released into the outside world. Based on two visits to each facility over a three-year period, Human Rights Watch has concluded the conditions at these facilities reflect an excessively punitive approach to """"problem"""" prisoners that does nothing to encourage their ability to reintegrate successfully into the general prison population or society. For some prisoners, the psychological consequences of supermaximum security confinement can be devastating. The Indiana Department of Corrections (DOC) has acknowledged that the harsh conditions at the MCF and the SHU are not necessary for all inmates and can be ameliorated without jeopardizing the goals of security and discipline. The confinement of persons who are mentally ill in these facilities is particularly reprehensible. Mentally ill prisoners often end up in the MCF and the SHU because they are unable to adjust to therules and stresses of prison life. """"To force prisoners with serious psychiatric disorders to live in extreme social isolation and unremitting idleness in a claustrophobic environment is barbaric,"""" according to Dr. Carl Fulwiler, a psychiatrist who accompanied Human Rights Watch to visit the MCF and the SHU in July 1997 as a representative of Physicians for Human Rights. """"The cruelty of confining them in the conditions which can aggravate their illness is compounded by the failure of the Indiana DOC to provide them with adequate mental health services."""" The dangers of placing mentally ill prisoners in supermaximum security facilities is exemplified by the case of Edgar Hughes, an inmate at the SHU who had been hospitalized numerous times in his life with psychiatric problems. Hughes, who was actively psychotic and had had physical confrontations with guards, mysteriously suffered a head trauma on September 11, 1997. His injuries are so severe that the current prognosis is that he will remain in a vegetative state. The available facts suggest one of two explanations: either Hughes was severely beaten by guards or he suffered a psychiatric breakdown during which he deliberately injured himself. Either way, his confinement at the SHU caused a terrible tragedy. Human Rights Watch has called on Indiana authorities to carry out a thorough investigation of this incident and to hold accountable anyone responsible for his condition. Based on its findings, Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations: 1. Offer Treatment and Conditions of Confinement Appropriate for Mentally Ill Prisoners The Indiana legislature should: Enact legislation that bars the administrative or disciplinary segregation in conditions of extreme social isolation and reduced environmental stimulus of seriously mentally ill inmates or of inmates who are at significant risk of suffering a serious injury to their mental health if confined in such conditions. Provide the Indiana DOC and/or the Department of Mental Health with the necessary financial resources to properly house and treat inmates who should not be confined at the SHU or MCF because of their mental health condition or histories. The Indiana Department of Corrections should: Develop, or collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to develop, secure facilities to house and treat mentally ill inmates who cannot be confined in the general prison population because of the safetyand security risks they pose, but who do not meet the existing criteria for in-patient hospitalization. These facilities should provide physical conditions and social interaction conducive to mental health and rehabilitation, and should be staffed by qualified mental health professionals. Undertake a comprehensive mental health evaluation of all inmates currently confined at the MCF and the SHU to identify those who should be excluded from segregated confinement because they are currently suffering from a serious mental disorder, have a history of severe mental illness or whose mental condition (e.g., brain damage, mental retardation, chronic depression) makes them vulnerable to deterioration if they remain in those facilities. Develop procedures to ensure that no prisoner sent to the MCF or to the SHU remains there for more than a brief period if they are persons for whom the risk is high that confinement in such facilities will cause serious mental health injury. Provide frequent monitoring by qualified health professionals of inmates at the SHU and MCF to identify those who need mental health services. Expand the range of mental health services available to inmates at the SHU and MCF, and grantinmates prompt access to such services. Provide sufficient staff to meet prisoners' mental health needs. It should also provide adequate custodial staff to enable prisoners to be escorted as needed to meetings in private with mental health staff, medical visits, meetings with visitors, and other activities conducive to their mental well being and rehabilitation. 2. Reduce Periods of Solitary Confinement The Indiana Department of Corrections should: Discontinue the policy of indefinite administrative segregation. Inmates should be assigned to administrative segregation for a fixed term that is not excessively long. Inmates should be able to reduce their time in administrative segregation through good behavior. No inmate should be assigned to an additional period of administrative segregation within three months of a prior period of segregation. Exceptions to this rule should only be permitted upon a finding, following a hearing, that the inmate constitutes a serious danger to prison safety and security and cannot be safely confined in a less restrictive setting. Such an inmate should also receive a mental health evaluation by an independent psychiatrist who must certify that the inmate is not suffering from severe mental disorders that would be exacerbated by continued segregation. Refrain from sentencing prisoners to disciplinary segregation at the MCF or the SHU for more than short periods of time unless they are guilty of extremely dangerous or violent actions, such as assaults against staff or prisoners causing serious bodily injury. Inmates should be able to reduce the period of disciplinary segregation through good behavior. Review disciplinary policies with the goal of instituting greater proportionality between sanctions for rules infractions and the type of infraction and, in particular, to reduce the amount of disciplinary time awarded for nonviolent infractions. Reduce the use of additional time in segregation as a punishment for violation of rules by segregated inmates. Explore alternatives that would serve the goal of promoting rule-abiding behavior by inmates without prolonging their time in segregation (e.g., use of increased privileges contingent on good behavior, training in anger and impulse control, and increased mental health services). Establish equivalent policies governing transfer to, release from, and privileges for disciplinary segregation inmates at the MCF and at the SHU. 3. Improve Physical Conditions The Indiana legislature should: Provide sufficient resources to the Indiana DOC to finance the modification of the physical plant at MCF and the SHU to eliminate egregiously harsh and harmful conditions. The Indiana Department of Corrections should: Renovate the MCF and the SHU to create genuine outdoor recreation areas in which inmates are exposed to sunlight and can see outside of the facility, and indoor or outdoor recreation areas large enough to allow inmates to run at a reasonably high speed and to exercise with another person comfortably. Construct sufficient windows in cells at the SHU so that no prisoner is confined in a windowless cell for more than a brief period. Replace the solid steel cell doors in use at the MCF with doors, such as those in use at the SHU, that allow prisoners greater opportunities for social interaction. 4. Eliminate Unnecessarily Harsh and Counterproductive Practices The Indiana Department of Corrections should: Establish a program of increased privileges, including enhanced access to congregate activities and educational and vocational activities, to reward and encourage infraction-free and responsible behavior by inmates confined in administrative and disciplinary segregation. Encourage increased contact between inmates and their families and communities. The department should end the routine shackling of all inmates during visits and consider permitting selected inmates to have contact visits with their families. It should increase access of inmates at the SHU to telephones. Discontinue its practice of releasing inmates into society directly from segregated confinement. Prior to release from the MCF or SHU, all inmates should be provided effective transition programming to facilitate social readjustment. Reduce racial tensions in the MCF and the SHU by, among other things, undertaking aggressive efforts to recruit and train African Americans as correctional staff, providing increased racial sensitivity training to staff, and emphasizing to staff through the use of internal disciplinary mechanisms that racial harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated.

In reviewing the landmine policies of all fifty-two active Commonwealth members, Human Rights Watch identifies six governments that oppose a global ban on mines.  """"These six governments--India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cyprus--are clearly out of touch with the rest of the Commonwealth when it comes to banning landmines. They are on the wrong side of humanity,"""" said Alex Vines, the author of the report. """"India, Pakistan and Singapore should be especially embarrassed to be among the rapidly dwindling number of countries still producing these insidious, indiscriminate weapons,"""" Vines added. Five other Commonwealth members--Canada, South Africa, Uganda, United Kingdom and Zimbabwe--have called a permanent halt to their mine production. """"We are also concerned that Australia, Kenya, Gambia and a handful of other Commonwealth members, while expressing support for a ban, have not yecommitted to signing the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines in Ottawa, Canada in December,"""" said Vines.  Thirty-four Commonwealth nations have already committed to signing the ban treaty in December. Canada and South Africa in particular have been at the forefront of the global movement to eradicate antipersonnel landmines. The report states that at least fourteen Commonwealth countries are suffering from an estimated two to five million landmines planted in their soil, with the most heavily infested being Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. In many of these countries antipersonnel mines pose a daily threat to rural development and free trade movement, the very focus of the Edinburgh meeting. Human Rights Watch calls on all Commonwealth governments to commit to the December ban treaty. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting should issue a declaration in support of the treaty and the urgent need to ban and destroy all antipersonnel mines. The Commonwealth should follow the example of the Central American, Caricom (Caribbean), and Southern African Development Community states and seek to make the Commonwealth a mine-free zone.","Global","Arms, Landmines"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/10/21/china-tightens-control-religion","China Tightens Control on Religion","China Tightens Control on Religion","","10/21/1997","China continues to violate the right to freedom of religion, although the worst forms of persecution long-term imprisonment and physical abuse of religious activists appear to have declined in recent years. In China: State Control of Religion, released today Human Rights Watch/Asia cites a dramatic growth in all religions in officially atheist China, with Buddhism growing the fastest of all. As interest in religion has increased, so have efforts by the state to control it. Chinese authorities continue the crackdown in the belief that religion breeds instability, separatism, and subversion, with Christianity and Islam in particular seen as vehicles for foreign influence and infiltration.  Control increasingly takes the form of a registration process administered by the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau through which the government monitors membership in religious organizations, locations of meetings, religious training, selection of clergy, publication of religious materials, and funding for religious activities. The government also now undertakes annual inspections of registered religious organizations. Failure to register can result in the imposition of fines, seizure of property, razing of """"illegal"""" religious structures, forcible dispersal of religious gatherings, and, occasionally, short term detention. In Tibet, control takes the form of political vetting of monks and nuns and strict supervision of their institutions. These controls not only violate the right to freedom of religion, but also the rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association.  While long-term imprisonment, violence, and physical abuse by security forces against religious activists still occur, they appear to be less frequent than they were at the time of the first Human Rights Watch study of religion in China in 1992. In 1997 Human Rights Watch found isolated cases but no evidence of widespread or systematic brutality. When reports of these harsher measures do surface, they are increasingly denounced by central government officials as examples of the excesses of local officials and their failure to implement policy directives correctly.  A key problem is the Chinese government's definition of freedom of religion as the right to private belief, rather than accepting freedom of religion in the broader context set forth in a key U.N. resolution called the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. That declaration states that freedom of religion includes among other things the right to assemble with others, to maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions, to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications, to teach a religion or belief in an appropriate place, to solicit and receive voluntary contributions, to train, appoint, elect or designate religious leaders, and to establish and maintain communications with others at the national and international levels.  Human Rights Watch details restrictions on religious activities in general as well as specific targets of government repression: Tibetan Buddhism, Islam in Xinjiang, the Catholic underground, evangelical Protestantism, and the wide variety of groups that the Chinese government labels cults and superstitious sects. The 71-page report includes a section on the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and several appendices containing copies of internal government regulations on religious policy and control of religious activities in specific areas of the country. Human Rights Watch/Asia urges the Chinese government to implement the recommendations made by Abdelfattah Amor, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, who visited China in 1994. Those recommendations include amending Article 36 of the Chinese constitution so that the right to manifest one's religion is recognized along with the right to freedom of belief; ending surveillance of religious activities; and releasing anyone detained for membership in """"unofficial"""" religious organizations.  Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to urge China to invite the Special Rapporteur back to China and to include concerns about China's restrictions on religious practices in a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, covering China's human rights practices more generally. In addition, concerned governments should develop a coordinated policy for pressing China to open Xinjiang and Tibet up to international human rights monitors and foreign journalists on a regular and unrestricted basis.  This report is the tenth in a series of Human Rights Watch reports covering freedom of religion in China and Tibet.  UPDATE Just after our new report, State Control of Religion in China, went to press on October 9, we received additional information about three cases mentioned in the report, including that one Protestant evangelical leader was sentenced to a ten-year term. The information, which remains to be officially confirmed, does not change the overall conclusions of the report including that the Chinese government uses long-term detention as the exception rather than the rule in dealing with religious activists but it is nonetheless disturbing. On September 25, 1997, the Zhengzhou Intermediate Court in Henan province sentenced Xu Yongze, also known as Peter Xu, to a ten-year prison term for """"disturbing public order."""" Xu, who is leader of the """"Born Again"""" movement, reportedly refused to defend himself on the grounds that the court had decided his sentence before the trial began. No family members were at the proceedings; they had not even been informed that a trial date had been set. Xu's thirty-year-old wife, Qing Jing, reportedly is still being held, as are Qin Musheng, his older brother, and Sister Fengxian. Liu Zhenying, a Charismatic group leader is believed to have escaped; it is unclear if Wang Xincai and Elder Qiao are still in detention; and no additional information about Brother Sun is available. Unconfirmed reports indicated that the court may have already sentenced some of the others arrested with Xu or are expected to do so soon. (See p. 20.)  Bishop Su Zhimin, the sixty-five-year-old underground bishop of Baoding, Hebei province, was taken into custody at 12:00 noon on October 8, 1997 in Xinji, Hebei, about 280 kilometers south of Beijing and returned to Baoding to the custody of the Public Security Bureau. After the crackdown in Donglu in May 1996 which culminated in the arrests of Auxiliary Bishop An Shuxin, priests, and lay leaders, Bishop Su went into hiding where he was able to remain for seventeen months. Before this current detention, Bishop Su was jailed at least five times, all told spending some twenty years in prison. (See p. 17.)  Unconfirmed information updating the treatment of Catholic school children from the area in and around Donglu suggests that children who cannot supply a written declaration by their parents stating either that they have renounced their faith or joined the official church still are not permitted to enroll in local schools. The practice, which began in mid-1995, reportedly affects a few hundred children in several villages. Some have gone elsewhere to study; some are being taught to read and write at home. Government work teams comprised of religious affairs and public security officials are still at work in the area. One of their initiatives involves organizing """"study classes"""" for children and youth unaffiliated with the official church. It has also been reported that as an incentive, children who join the official church are permitted to participate in religious activities. (See p. 17.) As in 1996, officials sealed off Donglu during May 1997, when pilgrimages to the Marian shrine there would normally have taken place. Officials arranged for military exercises and declared the area a military restricted zone. Work team members forced area Catholics to set up measures to keep outsiders away. Over 100 work team members were stationed in Donglu and over twenty in nearby villages.","Asia, China and Tibet","Religious Freedom"

By refusing to return materials seized from the Haitian military in September 1994, repeatedly suspending the deportation of Haitian paramilitary leader Emmanuel Constant from New York, and failing to disclose documents detailing U.S. investigations of atrocities, the Clinton Administration has impeded Haiti's progress in prosecuting those responsible for serious human rights abuses.  José Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas, asserted that the U.S. government's refusal to cooperate with Haiti's efforts to build the rule of law has damaged U.S. credibility. Vivanco stated, """"While the U.S. government formally endorses programs designed to improve Haiti's justice system, it is simultaneously obstructing efforts to establish justice for Haitian human rights victims."""" The rights group invited Secretary Albright to remedy these U.S. actions by ordering the immediate return of the FRAPH materials to the Haitian government; revoking the suspension of deportation granted FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant; and promptly providing Haitian prosecutors with all documents detailing U.S. investigations of the 1993 Cité Soleil and 1994 Raboteau massacres. October 16, 1997 Madeleine Albright Secretary of State U.S. Department of State Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Secretary Albright: Since the restoration of democratic government to Haiti, the United States has played a leading role in reforming the Haitian police and judiciary and supporting elections. However, by refusing to return materials seized from the Haitian military in September 1994, repeatedly suspending the deportation of Haitian paramilitary leader Emmanuel Constant from New York, and failing to disclose documents detailing U.S. investigations of atrocities, the Clinton Administration has impeded Haiti's progress in prosecuting those responsible for serious human rights abuses. In your coming visit to Haiti, Human Rights Watch/Americas urges you to demonstrate a genuine U.S. commitment to democratic values and the rule of law by lifting these impediments to justice for Haitian victims of human rights abuse. For over three years, the U.S. government has refused to return approximately 160,000 pages of documents and other materials seized in 1994 from the Haitian military and the paramilitary group, the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (Front pour l'Avancement et Progrés d'Haïti, FRAPH). Reportedly founded with CIA assistance, FRAPH was responsible for atrocities under the military government that ruled Haiti from 1991 to 1994. The U.S. continues to insist that the documents will be returned only after the names of U.S. citizens have been excised, apparently for the illegitimate purpose of covering up U.S. complicity in political murder and other abuses, particularly the relationship between U.S. intelligence assets and the military government and FRAPH. Ambassador William Swing has stated that the U.S. government already removed information identifying U.S. citizens from 113 pages of the materials. In August 1997, as it had in 1996, the State Department acted to prevent the deportation of FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant, who had received regular CIA payments while directing the paramilitary organization. Arguing that Constant's return to Haiti might cause instability and burden the judicialsystem, the State Department allowed him to remain in New York with a work permit. This kept Constant, who is wanted for serious human rights crimes in Haiti, out of the reach of Haitian prosecutors, despite assurances by high-ranking Haitian officials that he would receive a fair trial. The U.S. government also has failed to turn over important investigative materials to the International Lawyers' Bureau, a special prosecution team of the Haitian justice ministry, despite requests by Haitian authorities. The Lawyers' Bureau is preparing trials of those accused of the December 1993 massacre of at least thirty residents of Cité Soleil and the 1994 massacre of at least fifteen individuals in Raboteau, near Gona‹ves, both of which were committed by Haitian soldiers and FRAPH members. U.S. authorities, including Amb. Swing, conducted inquiries into these incidents shortly after they occurred, and reportedly have prepared written summaries of their findings. However, in June 1997, the State Department denied Haiti's request for expedited delivery of the Cité Soleil materials. The State Department still has not responded to Haiti's March request for expedited delivery of the Raboteau materials. The U.S. government's refusal to cooperate with Haiti's efforts to build the rule of law has damaged U.S. credibility. While the U.S. government formally endorses programs designed to improve Haiti's justice system, it is simultaneously obstructing efforts to establish justice for Haitian human rights victims. Human Rights Watch/Americas therefore urges you to order the immediate return of the FRAPH materials to the Haitian government, without any excision of the names of U.S. citizens; to revoke the suspension of deportation granted FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant; and promptly to provide Haitian prosecutors with all documents detailing U.S. investigations of the Cité Soleil and Raboteau massacres.

The last year has seen the longest, most intense spell of violence since the beginning of the conflict in Algeria five years ago. Violence which has taken a new and terrifying turn with the massacre of civilians. Thousands of people - women and children, the poor and elderly -- have been massacred with unspeakable brutality. Some of those lucky enough to have escaped having their throats cut or being burned alive in their homes have reached nearby security forces posts and called for help. In vain. Their cries have not been heard in their country, or beyond their national borders. Up to 80,000 people have been killed behind a virtual wall of silence on the part of the international community.  Recent statements of the UN Secretary-General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNICEF and the UNHCR condemning the massacres of civilians and other human rights abuses in Algeria go some way towards breaking through the barriers of silence surrounding the crisis. But words are not enough. The international community has for too long turned a blind eye to the plight of the victims in Algeria, in spite of the warnings sounded by human rights organizations. The UN Commission on Human Rights has so far not scrutinized the situation. It is time to take concrete action to end this spiral of violence and to ensure the protection of the civilian population. The need to investigate and reveal the truth is the first step to finding solutions to this human rights tragedy. For this reason, we are calling for the establishment of an international investigation to ascertain the facts, examine allegations of responsibility and to make recommendations in respect of the massacres and other abuses by all sides in Algeria. Such an investigation has to be provided with broad powers, adequate staff and resources. It should collect evidence, statements, including testimony from victims, witnesses and responsible officials, to discover the truth.  Since the outbreak of the current conflict in 1992, extrajudicial executions, deliberate and arbitrary killings, torture, rape, """"disappearances"""" and hostage-taking have become routine. The large-scale massacres of civilians over the past year have taken place against a background of increasingly widespread human rights abuses by security forces, state-armed militias and armed Islamist groups, which have increasingly targeted and terrorized civilians. Disregard for human rights has become the rule rather than the exception. This is despite the fact that Algeria has ratified important international and regional human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Time after time, the Algerian Government has simply failed to investigate these abuses by its own forces and by armed opposition groups, and to bring those responsible to justice. This failure has exacerbated the breakdown of law and order and left civilians feeling ever more alone and unprotected. The complex reality of violence and counter-violence has become increasingly confused with the clampdown on information and investigations. Information defined by the authorities as""""security-related"""" is censored and manipulated. International human rights organizations and foreign media have often been refused entry to the country. Human rights workers and journalists who have been let into the country have been subject to surveillance and restrictions. Those who have continued to work in the country have faced death threats and killings. All of these actions have contributed to building a wall of silence around the human rights crisis in Algeria. We echo the call of the Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for enhanced cooperation and coordination between the UN and African institutions, and urge Member States of the OAU to support an initiative of this kind. In the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement with Algeria, which contains provisions for the respect of human rights, we urge Member States of the European Union to work for the special session of the Commission on Human Rights and the investigation to become a reality.  In the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993, UN Member States reaffirmed that the promotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate concern of the international community. We call on them now to honour their pledge. The Algerian Government routinely accuses anyone criticizing their human rights record of deliberately lying, interfering in Algeria's internal affairs, and political bias. Human rights protection is not just an internal affair or an issue of national sovereignty. Algeria is not above international scrutiny. At a time when its citizens are being slaughtered en masse week after week, the government of Algeria should welcome - not oppose - international attention aimed at helping to protect lives.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria",""

The four are accused of """"having caused and incited mutual hatred among citizens"""" because they hung a sign on September 6, 1995, saying """"Rainbow - Florina Committee"""" in both the Greek and Macedonian languages outside of their party office. HRW believes that the charges against them do not comport with Greek or international law and comprise an unlawful restriction on the right to free expression. Mr. Costas Simitis Prime Minister of Greece Honorable Prime Minister Simitis: Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, the largest American-based human rights organization, is deeply concerned about the upcoming trial of four Greek citizens from the Macedonian minority to be held in Florina on October 14. We believe that the charges against them do not comport with Greek or international law and comprise an unlawful restriction on the right to free expression. The four individuals, Vasilis Romas, Costas Tasopoulos, Petros Vasiliadis, and Pavlos Voskopoulos, activists of the ethnic Macedonian Rainbow Party, are accused of """"having caused and incited mutual hatred among citizens"""" because they hung a sign on September 6, 1995, saying """"Rainbow - Florina Committee"""" in both the Greek and Macedonian languages outside of their party office in Florina. In the evening of September 13, the police removed the sign on order of the state prosecutor. Shortly thereafter, a mob of people led by the Florina mayor physically attacked the office. The prosecutor charged the Rainbow Party leaders with inciting citizens to commit acts of violence, according to Article 192 of the Greek Penal Code. No criminal charges have been filed against the individuals or political leaders who took part in the attack on the office, even though the Rainbow Party leaders have filed such complaints. Quite the contrary, neither the government nor any of the major political parties condemned the attack. PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, publicly condemned the use of bilingual signs. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki understands that the Macedonian minority in Greece is a sensitive political and emotional issue and that the Macedonian words """"Lerinski Komitet"""" (""""Florina Committee"""") outside of the Rainbow Party office reminded some Greek citizens of a terrorist organization that was historically active in the region. However, this in no way justifies a mob attack on the party's office or a criminal action by the state against those who use their mother language. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki considers such legal action to be a direct violation of the right to free expression, as guaranteed in both Greek and international law. Likewise, by not prosecuting those who attacked the Rainbow Party office, the state is tolerating and, therefore, implicitly condoning mob justice rather than the rule of law. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the Greek government to drop its charges against the four defendants and to prosecute those who organized and were involved in the September 14, 1995, attack.

He was apparently transferred there within the past week from Myingyan jail, known to be one of the worst in Burma. Human Right Watch calls on the Burmese authorities to drop all charges against U Tin Win, to ensure that he has access to adequate medical care and the doctors of his choice, and to allow him to return to his home once he has recovered. U Win Tin, a journalist, was a founder of the National League for Democracy and was imprisoned in October 1989, accused of being a member of the banned Communist Party of Burma. He was sentenced to fourteen years by a military tribunal in Rangoon's notorious Insein jail and sometime in early 1996 was transferred to Myingyan, a town about 150 miles north of Rangoon. The transfer meant that relatives and supporters could no longer visit him or send him food and medicines. U Win Tin took a prominent part in a hunger strike in Insein jail in September 1990 and was reported to have been badly beaten. In 1993 and 1994 he was one of four political prisoners to meet with Congressman Bill Richardson. In photographs taken during the meetings, U Win Tin was seen to be wearing a surgical collar. He told the congressman he suffered from spondylitis (degeneration of the spine). In mid-1995 U Win Tin was one of a group of eight prisoners accused of sending letters to the United Nations detailing conditions within Insein prison. He was reportedly beaten and kept solitary confinement in the prison's """"dog cells"""" (formerly the kennels for the prison guard dogs). It was later learned that he was sentenced to an additional five years under prison regulations banning the possession of writing materials.

The absence of any written or published penal code, or codes of criminal or judicial procedure, permits the authorities excessively wide discretion to decide what constitutes a criminal offense and what sentences are appropriate. These serious flaws are especially disturbing given Saudi Arabia's increasing use of the death penalty--more than 540 executions since 1990, and at least one hundred in the first nine months of 1997 alone. """"It is precisely these types of shortcomings of the judicial system that reveal the inherently cruel and irreversible nature of the death penalty,"""" said Hanny Megally, the executive director of Human Rights Watch/Middle East, """"and the reason for our categorical opposition to its use."""" Human Rights Watch finds that foreign workers in Saudi Arabia are especially vulnerable to serious abuses, including arrest and punishment on spurious charges brought by employers attempting to force them to relinquish their legitimate claims for compensation. The great majority of those executed have been foreigners, including some cases in which there was ample evidence to support the victims' claims of innocence. The report cites a series of letters written by al-Naqshabandi to the trial judge, alleging that his employer, a nephew of King Fahd, had brought false charges against him when he refused to falsely testify against another employee. Although the letters provide names of more than twenty witnesses al-Naqshabandi says could verify his version of events, according to his family, no defense witnesses were ever called. Friends and family who saw al-Naqshabandi in prison only three days before his execution say that at that time he did not know that he had been convicted of any offense, let alone sentenced to death. Although the family and the Syrian embassy formally requested that the body be returned to Syria, the Saudi government has refused to authorize its release to the family. Human Rights Watch calls on the Saudi government to ensure that all laws exist in clear written form, and are freely available to the public and to all parties engaged in legal actions. At a minimum, crimes punishable by imprisonment, corporal or capital punishment should be codified in written form. Human Rights Watch further urges the Saudi government to take immediate steps toward the elimination of the death penalty from Saudi law, including an immediate halt to all executions, and to end the criminalization of the exercise of freedom of belief or expression. Finally, Human Rights Watch calls upon Saudi Arabia to conduct an independent investigation into the arrest, detention, trial and execution of `Abd al-Karim al-Naqshabandi, and to return his body to his family for burial in Syria.

Hundreds of arbitrary detentions violated defendants' most elemental due-process rights. Detainees who were interrogated were commonly tortured, and the few who were brought to court were denied a fair trial  Physical abuse caused or contributed to many of the fourteen deaths that have occurred in custody since 1994. The PA has also threatened and arrested journalists, human rights activists, and other critics, encouraging self-censorship and creating a climate of fear and intimidation.  Human Rights Watch criticizes Israel and the U.S. for pressuring the PA to crack down on anti-Israel violence while showing little or no concern for the methods used. Executive director Kenneth Roth said, """"On her trip to the region, Secretary of State Madeline Albright demanded a crackdown on terrorism by the PA. We have no quarrel with that. But given the PA's dismal record of arbitrary arrests, jailing of critics, and the absence of a functioning, independent judiciary, Washington's failure to publicly urge respect for human rights when combating anti-Israeli violence amounts to encouragement to resort once again to these abusive methods. This is a myopic approach to the peace process.""""  Roth also noted that in August, the U.S. announced it would assign a Central Intelligence Agency officer to attend regularly the security talks between Israel and the PA. By involving itself in this fashion, Roth said, """"the U.S. assumes a heightened responsibility to use its influence to ensure that security be pursued, both by the PA and by Israel, in a manner that does not trample on human rights.""""  While the abusive record of the PA may be due in part to shortfalls in resources, training and experience, and to outside pressure to crack down on militant movements, the report stresses that these factors cannot justify or fully explain the PA's disregard for the rule of law and intolerance of peaceful opposition and dissent. The pattern of abusive conduct goes well beyond cases involving suspected Islamist militants, and displays a pervasive failure of political will by the PA's top leadership to make human rights protection a priority. Torture by the Palestinian security forces has become routine in cases where detainees are interrogated, according to Human Rights Watch. Methods include some of those routinely practiced by Israeli interrogators, such as prolonged and painful body positioning, but also beatings with fists, clubs and rifle butts. Abusers have been held accountable for their acts only in rare cases where the death or injury of the victim has caused an outcry among Palestinians and from other governments. But the trials in these cases were so brief and disrespectful of fair-trial guarantees that they seemed more a concession to public pressure than an effort to see that justice is served. The report details what is known about the fourteen cases of death in PA custody. While the PA's repressive tendencies fall well short of stamping out all dissent or critical voices, the pattern of intimidation, arrests, and physical mistreatment documented in the 81-page report has created a climate of fear among Palestinians. Those who have been arbitrarily arrested include prominent journalists and rights activists, and leaders of a West Bank teachers' strike. In one recent case, a university professor has been in detention since early July after asking students to write an essay on, among other things, corruption in the PA. In this atmosphere, the Palestinian Legislative Council has emerged as the preeminent forum in Palestinian society for airing human rights concerns and other controversial issues. Council members boldly raise cases of torture and confront the executive over arbitrary acts by the security forces. This helps to explain why broadcasts by local independent stations of the full council sessions have been so popular among television viewers on the West Bank. It also may explain why the PA jammed these broadcasts last spring and why they remain off the air at this time.  To date, the U.S. has publicly intervened with the PA only when the victims of abuse have not been associated with opposition to the Israeli-PLO peace process. While such efforts are welcome, the U.S. should adopt a more principled approach by publicly encouraging the PA also to respect human rights when it responds to anti-Israel violence. Suspects should be formally charged and given fair trials or released, in contrast to the round-ups in 1996, following suicide bombings in Israel, when about one thousand suspected Islamists were arbitrarily rounded up and held for months without charge or access to lawyers.  The PA must, with international support, move quickly to institutionalize the safeguards for free expression and association and the rights of suspects in custody. It should establish clear lines of authority for its security forces and put them on notice that allegations of abuse will be thoroughly and impartially investigated and that security forces found to have committed abuses will be punished or disciplined. It should adopt the Palestinian draft Basic Law, a kind of constitution for the transitional period refined by the Legislative Council, or some other legal code that enshrines core civil and political rights in the self-rule area. If the PA fails to institutionalize these safeguards against abuses, abusive practices that prevail today will be the blueprint for the Palestinian future. The international community, intent on addressing Israel's security concerns and preserving the Israeli-PLO peace process, must cease turning a blind eye to abuses committed in the name of security, whether by the PA or by Israel. Such an approach poses a long-term threat to the durability of the peace process that the international community supports. Human Rights Watch wrote to the PA on several occasions to invite comment on the issues raised in this report, but has received no reply. Those letters are attached to the report.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Israel/Palestine",""

September 30, 1997 President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali Palais Presidentiel Tunis, Tunisia Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch/Middle East is gravely concerned by the arrest of Khemais Ksila and urges his immediate release. Ksila, a vice-president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights (LTDH), was arrested yesterday afternoon at his home in Ariana by plainclothes police who presented no arrest warrant. Earlier in the day, Ksila had launched a publicly declared hunger strike at the headquarters in Tunis of the LTDH, to protest the harassment he has endured, apparently as a result of his human rights work, including the dismissal in February 1996 from his job at the national railroad company, confiscation of his passport and constant police surveillance. According to information from his family, Ksila was questioned by an investigating magistrate about the communique‚ announcing his hunger strike, which had been circulated internationally. Ksila was then remanded into custody on suspicion of """"inciting public disturbances"""" and """"spreading false news."""" He is presently in April 9 Prison in Tunis, where neither his family nor his lawyers have been able to visit him. Another hearing before an investigative judge is scheduled for tomorrow, October 1. In his communique, Ksila demanded the restoration of his rights and criticized the government for """"regimenting all of society, eliminating all dissent and taking over all information institutions to the point where news in Tunisia has deteriorated to a level that the country has never before known; meanwhile, most institutions and organizations of civil society have been turned into satellites after having been tamed and destroyed, through wide-scale fear and terror."""" We believe that Ksila has been arbitrarily arrested solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression, a right protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Tunisia has ratified.

We note, also, that the building where his family resides remained today under constant police surveillance, according to our information.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/09/27/conflict-intensifies-east-timor","Conflict Intensifies in East Timor","Conflict Intensifies in East Timor","","09/27/1997","(New York) - In a new report Deteriorating Human Rights in East Timor, Human Rights Watch/Asia says the conflict in the disputed territory has intensified since a series of guerrilla attacks around the Indonesian parliamentary elections last May. While both sides have violated a cardinal principle of international humanitarian law protecting civilians and non-combatants from hostilities the Indonesian army has been responsible for widespread arbitrary arrest and detention, often accompanied by torture, in its response to the attacks. The report links the recent violence to a build-up of Indonesian paramilitary and counterinsurgency forces in East Timor. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to request full transparency from the Indonesian armed forces on the number of personnel stationed in East Timor, including rotating battalions, special forces, locally-formed counterinsurgency units, paramilitary groups, police, and intelligence units, and to engage the Indonesian government in discussions on how to reduce that number.      September 1, 1997  Deteriorating Human Rights in East Timor         The report places particular emphasis on the problem of torture and calls on the Indonesian government to make an announcement, to be published in the newspaper Suara Timor Timur (Voice of East Timor) and other public places, that members of the security forces, including police, army, and various paramilitary groups, are explicitly banned from using any form of torture, including electric shocks, beatings, and submersion in water, at all times. The government should cooperate with local human rights organizations like the Commission on Justice and Peace to set up a mechanism by which torture victims could report to the commission with confidence that their accounts would be fully investigated, that they themselves would suffer no reprisals, and that the torturers would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Virtually all branches of the Indonesian army have been responsible for torture, but allegations center most frequently on Kopassus, the army special forces, and on the joint military intelligence unit known in East Timor as SGI. The report notes that the Indonesian government has learned that torture can be politically costly in case of internationally-known activists or those likely to be the subject of diplomatic inquiries, but there is almost no cost associated with torturing villagers who are only briefly in detention. Human Rights Watch also calls on members of the armed opposition to cease the practice of executing unarmed civilians suspected of being collaborators and informers. Such executions are in violation of international humanitarian law. The report notes that the violence followed a period of growing social and political tension in East Timor. Some of this was caused by the proliferation of Indonesian paramilitary groups and counterinsurgency forces beginning in mid-1995, many of them composed largely of East Timorese who were given rudimentary training before being equipped with firearms. A pro-integration youth militia, known by the Indonesian acronym of Gardapaksi, had also become a major problem. Created in 1995, ostensibly to provide vocational training for East Timorese youth, Gardapaksi members quickly became partners of the Indonesian army special forces in military operations. Tension has also increased with the influx of Indonesians to East Timor, both through official transmigration programs as well as """"spontaneous"""" migration. (The Indonesian transmigration minister made a point of campaigning for the ruling party, GOLKAR, in transmigration sites in East Timor.) Yet another source of tension is related to the economic development plans for East Timor. These plans include a huge project for cultivating sugarcane, taking up 25,000 hectares of the most fertile land along the southern coast of the territory, which is about to get underway. The main investor is President Soeharto's son, Tommy Soeharto. The political implications of tensions caused by a heavy military presence combined with extensive in-migration were highlighted as early as 1990, the report notes, but the problems remain unaddressed by the Indonesian government.","Asia, Timor-Leste",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/09/18/human-rights-watch-condemns-abduction-and-killing-children-ugandan-rebel-group","Human Rights Watch Condemns Abduction and Killing of Children by Ugandan Rebel Group","Human Rights Watch Condemns Abduction and Killing of Children by Ugandan Rebel Group","","09/18/1997","Children in Uganda are abducted and frequently murdered by the Lord's Resistance Army, a heavily-armed rebel group fighting the Ugandan government, according to The Scars of Death: Children Abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, released today by Human Rights Watch.   The 137-page report charges that children as young as eight years old are kidnapped, tortured, raped, virtually enslaved and sometimes killed by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the name of """"the Holy Spirit"""". The LRA attacks homes and schools in northern Uganda, and targets children for use as soldiers in its attempt to overthrow the Ugandan government.   The precise number of children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army is unknown, but reliable estimates suggest that over the past two years, three to five thousand children have escaped from rebel captivity. An equal number are believed to be still in captivity, and an unknown number of abducted children are dead.   The captive children are forced to take part in combat, carry heavy loads, act as personal servants to the rebels, and, in the case of girls, serve as """"wives"""" to rebel commanders. The children undergo a brutal initiation into rebel life: they are forced to participate in acts of extreme violence, often being compelled to help beat or hack to death fellow child captives who have attempted to escape. The rebels march their child captives to rebel base camps in neighboring southern Sudan, and many children die of disease or starvation during the march.   Those children who survive the journey are given rudimentary military training, are armed, and then forced into combat against the Ugandan army and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). In combat, children are forced to the front line and beaten by their commanders if they retreat or take cover.  The Scars of Death tells the stories of Ugandan children who have escaped from rebel captivity. In their own words, Ugandan children tell of their experiences:   """"One boy tried to escape [from the rebels], but he was caught . . . . His hands were tied, and then they made us, the other new captives, kill him with a stick. I felt sick . . . I refused to kill him [but] they pointed a gun at me, so I had to do it. The boy was asking me, """"Why are you doing this?"""" I said I had no choice. After we killed him, they made us smear his blood on our arms . . .. They said we had to do this so we would not fear death and so we would not try to escape. I still dream about the boy [whom] I killed. I see him in my dreams, and he is talking to me and saying I killed him for nothing, and I am crying.""""  -- Susan, sixteen   """"I went for several battles in Sudan . . . .The commanders . . . would tell us to run straight into gunfire. The commanders would stay behind and would beat those of us who would not run forward . .. . I remember the first time I was in the front line. The other side started firing, and the commander ordered us to run towards the bullets. I panicked. I saw others falling down dead around me. The commanders were beating us for not running, for trying to crouch down. I don't know why we were fighting . . . . We were just ordered to fight.""""  -- Timothy, fourteen   """"The human rights abuses of the Lord's Resistance Army shock the conscience: they violate both the most elementary principles of human morality and the most fundamental international humanitarian standards,"""" charges Lois Whitman, the director of the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project. In particular, the Lord's Resistance Army's abuses violate the provisions of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which lays out the minimum humanitarian rules applicable to internal armed conflicts. The abduction of children for military purposes also contravenes international standards established by Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obligate states parties to take all feasible measures to ensure that children under fifteen do not take part in hostilities and are protected in times of armed conflict.   The roots of the conflict between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan government lie in the complex religious traditions of the Acholi people of northern Uganda, in the history of ethnic violence and mistrust that has characterized Ugandan politics for much of the past few decades, and in the troubled relationship between the governments of Uganda and Sudan. The Lord's Resistance Army has long identified itself with a Christian religious tradition. It is led by Joseph Kony, who claims to be in communication with the Holy Spirit. The Lord's Resistance Army receives military assistance and other support from the militantly Islamic Sudanese government. The Sudanese government aids the Lord's Resistance Army in return for assistance in fighting the rebel Sudan P eople's Liberation Army (SPLA), and also in apparent retaliation for Ugandan government support of the SPLA.   Whatever the sources of the conflict, the Ugandan government is failing to protect Ugandan children from rebel abduction. For eleven years, the Ugandan army has been unable to combat the rebels effectively through military means, yet continues to maintain that the rebels are mere """"bandits,"""" on the verge of permanent defeat. Yet the rebel abductions and attacks on villages continue unabated.   Children who succeed in escaping from the Lord's Resistance Army find that their ordeal is far from over. Fearing rebel reprisals against themselves or their families if they return to their villages, most escaped children are afraid to go home. And many children literally have nowhere to go: the conflict has displaced more than 200,000 northern Ugandans from their rural homes. Tens of thousands of displaced people have set up temporary homes in the """"protected camps"""" established near army installations by the Ugandan government, but crowded conditions and lack of food and sanitation facilities have rendered the camp population vulnerable to malnutrition, disease and death. Thousands of people die in the camps every month, and despite the nearby military presence, the camps remain frequent targets for rebel attacks.   Two nongovernmental organizations (NGO) have set up live-in trauma counseling centers for children who have escaped from the rebels, but the centers are stretched thin and cannot possibly take in all of the children in need. The Ugandan government appears to be doing little to actively provide for the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of children who have escaped from rebel captivity. After completing a program at the NGO-run centers, the children must move on in order to make room for new escapees, but where they go and how they will support themselves is unknown. Their prospects are bleak.   The title of the Human Rights Watch report is taken from a proverb current among the Acholi people of northern Uganda: """"Poyo too pe rweny,"""" which translates as """"Death is a scar that never heals."""" The effects of the Lord's Resistance Army's atrocities will haunt Uganda for generations to come. Children who have escaped from the rebels wake screaming in the night from dreams of pain and death: their dreams are of deaths feared, deaths witnessed, and, all too often, deaths participated in. Perhaps some day, if peace comes, the scars of death will begin to fade. But they will never fully heal.   The Lord's Resistance Army's abduction of children is part of a troubling world-wide trend towards the increased use of children as soldiers. Children are more easily coerced and manipulated than adults, and the proliferation of light-weight automatic weapons makes it possible for even young children to take part in armed conflicts. Throughout the world, an estimated quarter of a million children under the age of eighteen serve as soldiers in government forces or armed opposition groups today. """"Involvement in armed conflict violates every right a child has,"""" said Yodon Thonden, counsel to the Human Rights Watch Children's Right's Project. """"The fact that so many children are being used as soldiers throughout the world demonstrates the failure of the international community to protect and care for its children, and the abduction of children by the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda represents a particularly tragic instance of that failure.""""   Human Rights Watch takes the position that no one under the age of eighteen should take part in armed conflicts of any kind, international or internal. Human Rights Watch supports the efforts of the international community (through the work of a U.N. working group under the Commission on Human Rights) to raise the minimum age for involvement in armed conflict to eighteen, through the creation of an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Human Rights Watch condemns the U.S. government's active opposition to international efforts to raise that age to eighteen.   In The Scars of Death, Human Rights Watch makes a number of recommendations to the parties involved in the conflict and to the international community:   To the Lord's Resistance Army:   immediately stop the abduction, killing, torture, and sexual abuse of children; immediately release all children remaining in captivity; ensure that Lord's Resistance Army combatants respect the human rights of civilians in the areas of conflict.   To the Government of Sudan:   use its influence with the Lord's Resistance Army to ensure that the above recommendations are followed; cease all military aid and other support to the Lord's Resistance Army, until they comply with the above recommendations;   To the Government of Uganda:   take all possible steps to protect children from abduction; when fighting against the Lord's Resistance Army, take all possible steps to minimize child casualties; ensure that all children who escape or are captured from the Lord's Resistance Army receive prompt and adequate access to medical attention and counseling while in government custody; release children promptly to their families, or if the families' whereabouts are unknown or the families are unable to receive the children, to arrange for appropriate alternative care for the children which takes into account their special needs; develop a concrete plan for meeting the long-term needs of former child soldiers; ensure that government soldiers respect the human rights of civilians in the north;   To the United Nations:   the U.N. special rapporteur for Sudan should investigate and report on the role of Sudan in supporting the Lord's Resistance Army, with special attention to the abduction, killing, torture, and rape of children; the U.N. Secretary General's special representative on the impact of armed conflict on children should promptly investigate the abduction, killing, torture and sexual abuse of children by the Lord's Resistance Army; the U.N. Working Group on a Draft Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts should seek to raise to eighteen the minimum age at which people can be recruited into armed forces and participate in hostilities (whether that recruitment is voluntary or compulsory, and whether it is into government armies or armed opposition groups). Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to help further these goals and to take concrete steps to end the military recruitment of children and the use of child soldiers worldwide.","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights, Joseph Kony - Lord's Resistance Army"

State control of the media and a lack of accountability for police brutality following last year's elections seriously undermine the legitimacy of Sunday's vote.  """"An election that does not allow open debate, particularly on television, and a climate of impunity are antithetical to real democracy,"""" charges Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. """"In his unwillingness to relinquish power, President Slobodon Milosevic and his ruling Socialist Party have subverted the electoral process."""" The Milosevicg overnment has demonstrated a blatant disregard for human rights during the past year, according to a new report, Discouraging Democracy: Elections and Human Rights in Serbia, released today. In November 1996, it annulled the results of local elections won largely by the opposition in Serbia and then beat those who protested. The government ultimately recognized the opposition's victory after eighty-eight days of peaceful demonstrations, but not before police arrested and beat hundreds of demonstrators. Excessive force was used on many occasions, even against journalists and others who were clearly not part of the protests. While the state-run television and radio ignored the massive protests, the government harassed and, at times, shut down the independent media that was covering the demonstrations. Many of these violations, such as the government's restrictions on the independent media, continued throughout 1997. In July the government temporarily closed down over seventy-five independent or opposition radio and television stations, ostensibly to """"establish order"""" in the airwaves. Other violations, like police violence against peaceful demonstrators and journalists, have never been addressed by the government. To this day, not a single government official or police officer has been held accountable for the violence that took place, even though more than sixty criminal charges have been filed with the state prosecutor by demonstrators and journalists who were beaten. Impunity for such abuses of authority virtually ensures that they will reoccur. Although most western governments criticized the 1996 electoral violations and subsequent police violence, many have since taken steps to welcome Yugoslavia back into the international community. In April 1997, the European Union granted Yugoslavia preferential trade status, which gives Yugoslavia beneficial conditions when trading with E.U. countries. Then, on May 15, the European Commission approved an aid package to Yugoslavia worth U.S. $112 million.  In this way, the E.U. has rewarded Yugoslav President Milosevic for doing what he was legally obligated to do in the first place -- recognize the elections -- without regard for the other human rights violations that persist today, including the persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and Milosevic's refusal to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia. Such concessions squander an essential source of leverage to compel Milosevic to improve his human rights record and to comply with the Dayton Agreement. In the report, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki makes the following recommendations to the Milosevic government and the international community: Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the Serbian (republican) and Yugoslav (federal) governments to: Investigate incidents of police abuse after the November 1996 elections and hold accountable all police officers and their superiors found responsible of using, or ordering the use of, unnecessary force, through administrative sanctions, such as dismissal, or through criminal prosecutions and sentencing. Open criminal investigations into the sixty-one known cases of police abuse that have already been submitted to the state prosecutor by Yugoslav citizens. If the prosecutor's office dismisses a case, it is obliged by law to notify the complainant right away so that he or she may initiate proceedings as a private prosecutor. Propose legal reform to enable individuals to bring legal action as a private prosecutor against police in both minor and serious cases when the public prosecutor has not responded to a complaint within a specified period of time. Prepare a code of conduct for law enforcement officials that addresses the prohibition of torture and all forms of police brutality, a definition of the legal use of force and conduct to safeguard human dignity and the basic rights of individuals. Establish an independent commission, with the participation of nongovernmental organizations and legal experts, to examine police abuse in Yugoslavia and its legal remedies. The commission should propose concrete changes in police procedure (from police training to civilian review) and Serbian and Yugoslav law to minimize police abuse and ensure that victims are able to seek redress. Prepare new media laws and regulations in full consultation with the independent media in Yugoslavia that guarantee freedom of expression in television and radio. Concrete changes in the Serbian Law on Radio and Television, the Laws on Connection Systems, and the Laws on Information should guarantee that broadcast licenses are distributed and regulated by an independent body without regard to political considerations. The new laws should take into account the concerns and proposals of the independent media. In the interim, permit all currently licensed, and all unlicensed but currently operating, radio and television stations to broadcast without interference. No regulation of the airwaves should take place until Yugoslavia has a new set of media laws and regulations that guarantee free expression in accordance with international standards. Ensure all parties contesting in the September 21, 1997, elections, and future elections, equal access to state television and radio, as well as to the state news agency, Tanjug. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the international community to: Carefully monitor the September 21, 1997, elections and its follow-up, making public the findings. Violations in electoral procedure, as well as violations before and after the vote (such as restrictions on the media or attempts to alter the results), should be publicly condemned. Implement a policy of human rights conditionality for aid to Yugoslavia. The international community should establish well defined human rights benchmarks and a timetable that the Yugoslav government must abide by, with negative consequences when progress is not made. Reviews should be regular and transparent. In bilateral and multilateral meetings with Yugoslav government officials, discuss the issues and recommendations raised in this report, and emphasize the importance of Yugoslavia respecting its international human rights obligations. Provide assistance to Yugoslavia's civil society, especially local nongovernmental organizations and the independent media. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the European Union to: Strongly reaffirm its principle of human rights conditionality and its readiness to respond firmly to Yugoslavia's non-compliance. Consider human rights conditions in Yugoslavia when reviewing Yugoslavia's preferential trade status, as is required in the April 1997 agreement between Yugoslavia and the E.U.. Lack of improvement in the key areas mentioned in the agreement (media laws, independence of the judiciary and minority rights) should result in disciplinary action against Yugoslavia and, perhaps, a revocation of the preferential trade status. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the European Parliament to: Ensure that E.U. conditionality principles are implemented. Ask to be kept fully informed about such implementation by the European Commission and European Council on an ongoing basis. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to: Deny Yugoslavia readmission to the OSCE until there are concrete improvements in the country's human rights record, including respect for freedom of the press, independence of the judiciary and minority rights, as well as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

Those same elections are now scheduled for September 13 and 14, but conditions remain much the same.   Although the 1996 elections were officially postponed because of massive irregularities committed during the registration period, top officials responsible for supervising the electoral process also admitted at the time that freedom of movement was limited, refugees had not been allowed to return to their homes, and, most importantly, indicted war criminals maintained predominant political and military control. This situation has not changed. By failing to arrest the indicted, the international community has squandered its best chance to create a safe and democratic climate for Bosnian voters next week.   Instead, the international community, led by the U.S. government, has futilely tried to """"sideline"""" the most influential of indicted persons -- Radovan Karadzic -- who stands accused of genocide. Karadzic is a master of exercising power behind the scenes. Despite agreeing in July 1996 to """"withdraw immediately from all political activities,"""" Karadzic remains the most powerful figure in Republika Srpska, and through his deputies and supporters continues to obstruct and undermine all efforts towards peace and democracy in Bosnia. Nothing short of his arrest and that of other indicted persons' will guarantee a peaceful future for Bosnia. The incidents described below illustrate Karadzic's ability to exercise power even after he has """"stepped aside.""""   The international community's current policy in Republika Srpska of providing political and military support for President Bijliana Plavsic is being offered as an alternative to the arrest and transfer of Karadzic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague. Whatever the merits of supporting President Plavsic, real change in Republika Srpska requires that Karadzic be arrested, not sidelined.   The high profile conflict between Bosnian Serb factions should not obscure the fact that Karadzic remains a dominant and corrosive political force. His control takes a variety of forms: he keeps the economy of Republika Srpska in a tight grip, through his control of energy, alcohol and tobacco monopolies and the black market, preventing economic reconstruction and siphoning off aid. His continued domination of the ruling SDS (Srpska Demokratska Stranka) party through his deputies, is evidenced by his attempts to remove Plavsic from office when she accused him and his top officials of corruption.   In many parts of Republika Srpska, Karadzic retains the loyalty of the police, thereby effectively blocking police reform. Many police salaries are paid directly by him, using the money he makes from his domination of the economy. In addition, Karadzic and his supporters retain control over most of the media, especially the Serb Radio and Television (SRT), which is used to broadcast ultranationalist propaganda and to incite attacks on NATO and U.N. personnel. Karadzic has also been linked to an active network of paramilitary organizations, some financed by him, which have been responsible for attacks on refugees and displaced persons trying to return to their former homes as well as on moderate Serbs in Republika Srpska.   It is also important to understand that whatever the outcome of the power struggle in Republika Srpska, Karadzic will not be turned over to the Hague unless he is arrested by international forces. Plavsic, irrespective of her recent acceptance of the Dayton agreement, remains an ultranationalist, who believes that Serbs and Muslims are biologically different and unable to coexist, and has described """"ethnic cleansing"""" as a western term for a natural phenomenon. She does not regard Karadzic as a war criminal and criticizes only his post-war leadership.   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, despite periodic assurances to U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke, has shown no signs of withdrawing his support from Karadzic. He has conspicuously avoided supporting Plavsic during the power struggle and, according to NATO sources, officers from the Serb Interior Ministry were sent to Brcko and Bijeljina to support police units loyal to Karadzic during confrontations with SFOR and Plavsic-backed police. Further, Milosevic has no interest in seeing Karadzic sent to the Hague: he himself might be implicated in the case of Karadzic's trial.   Recent events in Brcko, Bijeljina and Banja Luka point to a long established fact: Radovan Karadzic remains a fundamental obstacle to the successful implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. He and his supporters are involved in inciting and orchestrating violence, including attacks on SFOR and IPTF personnel, in blocking police and judicial reform. His party -- the SDS-- is threatening to boycott the elections, and he declared other political parties to be the enemies of Republika Srpska. What follows are a catalogue of incidents linking Karadzic and his supporters to acts of violence, intimidation, corruption, propaganda and subversion throughout Republika Srpska. All demonstrate that Karadzic cannot be sidelined - he must be arrested immediately.   Karadzic Remains De Facto Head of The Ruling SDS Party   The Serbian newspaper Gradjanin reports that at the session of the SDS's Main Committee, held in Pale on September 5, the main speaker was Radovan Karadzic. At that meeting, Karadzic presented his """"Guidelines No. 7"""" a fourteen-page document outlining SDS strategies. The document states: """"Although it has been our practice not to mention other parties in our campaign, this time we must tell the people that all the parties which caused the crisis by supporting Bilijana Plavsic's illegitimate practices are endangering our state and its survival..."""" At the August 20 meeting of the Main Committee of the SDS in Banja Luka, a huge photograph of Radovan Karadzic was displayed over the heads of attendees, who included Bosnia and Hercegovina Co-President Momcilo Krajisnik, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Gojko Klikovic, and other SDS hardliners. The meeting was televised, in contravention of the agreement on Karadzic's withdrawal from political life, which forbids the use of his image for campaign purposes. Aleksa Buha, Republika Srpska foreign minister, refers to himself as the """"acting head"""" of the SDS in deference to Karadzic's role. Additionally, Karadzic's photographs have been a pervasive presence at SDS rallies. David Foley, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) stated at a press briefing in Sarajevo on September 8 that this, in addition to references to Karadzic during the rallies, represented """"an egregious violation of the agreement of 18 July 1996 [which required Karadzic to leave political office.]"""" Karadzic Continues to Be Fully Involved in Government   In testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on July 17, 1997, Harold Johnson of the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that Radovan Karadzic """"effectively retains control of Republika Srpska"""" and actively participates in thwarting attempts at national reconciliation. Johnson recounted the early June 1997 example of Karadzic directing the Republika Srpska Minister of Refugees not to take part in an """"Open Cities"""" project [a UNHCR initiative to try to provide a financial incentive for municipalities to welcome back returnees.] The minister had been about to submit a list of nine cities in Republika Srpska that wanted to take part in the project. Karadzic Retains Substantial Control Over the Police   The NATO takeover of the Banja Luka police station revealed a huge cache of weapons which included huge numbers of rifles, grenades, mines, and extensive surveillance equipment, demonstrating the capability of the Pale-aligned police. The police had been part of a force directly paid by Karadzic, according to the New York Times.   Dragan Kijac, the Pale-based """"Minister of the Interior,"""" closely associated with Radovan Karadzic and Momcilo Krajisnik, appeared with about 30 armed policemen to escort the Krajisnik entourage to Banja Luka on September 8. Kijac was formally dismissed as Minister of the Interior by President Plavsic in August 1997. As Minister of the Interior, he controlled both regular and secret police forces throughout the Republika Srpska. It is believed that Kijac continues to exert control over police in a number of towns, including Brcko, Bijeljina, Foca, Zvornik, Pale, Doboj, and Teslic. On September 1, 1997, hundreds of pro-Karadzic supporters surrounded U.S. troops which had seized a Pale-controlled television transmitter near Bijeljina following continued provocations against NATO forces and internationals in the Pale-backed media. Following the withdrawal of SFOR from the television transmitter, police loyal to Biljana Plavsic were forced to leave Brcko or face retribution. According to Reuters, """"Karadzic's hard-liners were leaving nothing to chance in Brcko and Bijeljina and had deployed special police units to perform civilian duties."""" Karadzic And His Allies Are Willing to Use Violence for Political Ends   On August 15, the Republika Srpska constitutional court (the highest entity court) ruled that Plavsic acted illegally when she dissolved the Republika Srpska parliament on July 3, following signs that Krajisnik and Karadzic, in league with others, were planning to oust her from the presidency of the Republika Srpska. It is known that hard-line Karadzic loyalists control the constitutional court. One judge was beaten up when he indicated that he might support the dissolution of the parliament. Pale television subsequently reported that he had suffered a heart attack. He ultimately abstained from the vote, in fear for his life, having been threatened with """"liquidation"""" when attacked in his hotel room. Only one judge, Rajko Kuzmanovic, dared to dissent, and referred to the court's ruling as """"compromised."""" When the top three SDS candidates in Brcko were stricken from the ballot by the Election Appeals Sub-Commission for violations of the election law, four bomb threats were made in one day against the OSCE field office in Brcko, and a hand grenade was thrown outside the residence of Ambassador Farrand. Opposition to Karadzic Is Not Tolerated   Karadzic supporters """"have begun a campaign of reprisals, arrests, and death threats against those who have supported recent efforts to isolate Karadzic"""" according to a September 9 report from the Los Angeles Times. Gunman have carried out raids on the homes of Mr. Karadzic's opponents in three main cities in Republika Srpska, purging pro-Plavsic police from local forces and arresting or dismissing dozens of Serbs opposed to him. Human rights activists in Republika Srpska have been the subject of death threats. A senior American official in Brcko is quoted as accusing Mr. Karadzic's supporters of unleashing a 'reign of terror.' In Bijeljina, 24 persons who belonged to Karadzic's wing of the SDS but who switched allegiance to Biljana Plavsic have been fired since August 28, including the principal at the local high school, the postmaster, and directors of several companies. Two members of the opposition party were beaten up after putting up campaign posters for the upcoming election. Karadzic-Controlled Media Incites Violence Against Opponents and Internationals   Following attacks on SFOR troops, UN IPTF police monitors and other internationals in Brcko, Gojko Klikovic stated on Radio Brcko on August 28 that """"If you people of Brcko hadn't done this, the same scenario would happen like in Banja Luka...Biljana Plavsic is a new commander of SFOR, she is pushing our children in SFOR uniforms to take our transmitters."""" He concluded by saying """"We have to defend Karadzic, he is our soul"""".","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","International Justice"

Despite the tough talk and harsh treatment, these youths will return to society. For society's sake as well as theirs, the state needs to make major changes,"""" urged Lois Whitman, Director of the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project. Human Rights Watch found the following human rights abuses in the Colorado system: Shameful crowding at almost every institution, which lies at the root of many of the other problems. Some are occupied at two and a half times their planned capacity. Over representation of minority children in commitment. Commitment of children who could learn and be supervised within the community and present no threat to public safety. Use of restraints and punitive segregation in violation of international standards. Lack of education and psychological treatment for many of the children to prepare them for reintegration into the community. State abdication of its responsibilities and surrender of its powers to protect children committed to its care, by sending children to private facilities, both in and out of state. The placement of children out of state, away from their families, and in private contract facilities where the state has little control over day-to-day operations or the quality and training of staff. Complaints of chronic hunger except at Adams Youth Services Center and the Youthful Offender System. Boys tended to complain about quantity; girls, about quality. At Mount View, almost all those interviewed said the food contained foreign substances. Detention of children for status offenses, like truancy, if the child committed the status offence while under court jurisdiction. Ironically, juveniles detained for truancy may not be able to attend classes. Unsafe conditions ranging from staff failure to protect children from assaults by other inmates, to health code violations. Unreported incidents of physical and verbal abuse of children by staff. About 16,000 children in Colorado were in detention during 1995. In 1996, the number was 17,500, more than double the number of juveniles in detention a decade earlier. Of those passing through the system, more than half are released within forty-eight hours. The rest are held for further action. Some eventually go to community-based programs. Others are detained for trial, held for assessment or kept waiting in detention for a placement. About 330 children were sentenced to the adult Department of Corrections in 1996. Another 700 were committed to the Division of Youth Corrections. Human Rights Watch interviewed children and staff at seven state-operated institutions and one private contract facility between July 1996 and January 1997. High Country Lockup specifically looks at conditions in these facilities against the backdrop of United Nations standards for the treatment of children, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been signed but not ratified by the U.S., and other international agreements. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified or acceded to by 190 countries; only two countries have not done so: Somalia, which has no internationally-recognized government, and the United States. Human Rights Watch offers a detailed set of recommendations to improve conditions for children in Colorado facilities, and to make those facilities conform with international standards. Among them: To the state of Colorado: Ensure that state standards for the care and treatment of children in detention and correction institutions--both state-run and private--comply with international standards. Order a review of all children in custody with an eye toward releasing those who pose no threat to public safety. Replace incarceration with community-based services whenever possible. End overcrowding of institutions; place a population cap on all juvenile institutions and ensure that it is observed. End immediately the practice of placing three or four children in a room designed for one. Provide each child with a bed and reasonable privacy. Regularly advise courts of the number of beds available for commitments; ensure that number is not exceeded. Immediately end under-staffing; provide sufficient numbers of well-trained staff so that children can be properly supervised. End the practice of placing children under eighteen in adult prisons or detention facilities. Ensure that institutions provide a safe and healthy environment for children. Ensure that treatment and education, not punishment, are the primary goals of the juvenile justice system. Allow children at least one hour a day for outdoor exercise. Eliminate placement of children in private contract facilities that violate international standards and bring children home from out-of-state placements. Ensure that courts hold expedited hearings for youths terminated from the Youthful Offender System. Those terminated should not be forced to wait for months in lockdown until the court schedules a hearing. Rigorously enforce regulations against physical abuse of children by staff. Appropriately discipline staff found to have abused children; dismiss where indicated. Where appropriate, bring criminal charges against staff. Fully inform staff of the rules and consequences concerning physical abuse of children. Adhere to grievance procedures, take appropriate follow-up action, and notify children of the disposition of their grievances. End the practice of using isolation as a disciplinary measure. Provide sufficient food for all children. Take steps to correct the committing of disproportionate numbers of minority children to institutions. Do not place status offenders in detention or correction facilities. Provide children with access to attorneys, both in person and on the telephone. To the Federal government: In accordance with the purposes of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention should: Develop mandatory standards for the administration of juvenile justice that at a minimum comply with international standards, and apply to both public and private institutions. Assist state and local governments in improving the administration of juvenile justice. Monitor states that take part in the formula grants program to ensure that status offenders are not held in detention facilities or corrections institutions; that children are not incarcerated with adults; and that the juvenile justice system is administered fairly, without discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or other status. The Department of Justice, in accordance with the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, should regularly initiate investigations into the conditions in which children are confined to determine that they comply with U.S. constitutional law and international standards. Congress should pass legislation expanding the mandate of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to include a requirement to monitor the conditions of confinement for children in the justice system and states' compliance with U.S. constitutional law in confining children. The United States should ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Sayegh, a Saudi national, was extradited to the U.S. from Canada on the basis of allegations that he was involved in the June 1996 bombing of a U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. has now moved to dismiss charges against Sayegh for lack of evidence, and the Justice Department has said it would """"respond appropriately"""" to Saudi Arabia's request for extradition.  """"Human Rights Watch strongly believes that Saudi Arabia's human rights record should rule out any consideration of extraditing or deporting Sayegh to that country,"""" Executive Director Kenneth Roth wrote to Reno, citing that country's absence of basic due process rights and regular use of torture to secure confessions. Roth also expressed alarm that U.S. officials have voiced readiness to use the threat of deportation to Saudi Arabia to coerce Sayegh's cooperation. A copy of the letter follows. September 10, 1997 Attorney General Janet Reno Department of Justice Washington, DC by facsimile: 514 4371 Dear Attorney General Reno, We are writing you with regard to the case of Hani Abd al-Rahim Hussein Sayegh, a Saudi national who was extradited to the United States in June, from Canada, in connection with his alleged involvement in attacks or planned attacks against U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia. The Justice Department announced on September 8 that it has moved to dismiss the charges against Sayegh for lack of evidence, and to pursue """"immigration removal proceedings"""" against him. Saudi Arabia, according to State Department officials, has requested Sayegh's extradition to face prosecution there in connection with the June 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers barracks, and the Justice Department has stated that it will """"respond appropriately"""" to this request.  A hearing to rule on the department's motion to dismiss is scheduled for today before the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. We urge you or another responsible Department of Justice official to make clear at today's hearing or at the earliest appropriate time that the U.S. government will not consider extraditing or deporting Sayegh to Saudi Arabia given that country's appalling and inexcusable human rights record, particularly its treatment of criminal suspects. Sayegh has reportedly expressed fear that, as a political dissident and a member of the minority Shi`a Muslim community, he would be subject to torture and abuse in Saudi custody, would not receive a fair trial, and would face execution if convicted. According to press reports, it was on the basis of this fear that he agreed to be extradited from Canada to the United States rather than to Saudi Arabia.  Human Rights Watch strongly believes that Saudi Arabia's human rights record should rule out any consideration of extraditing or deporting Sayegh to that country. Saudi Arabia's legal system sanctions serious violations of basic due process rights guaranteed in international human right law. Human Rights Watch and other international human rights organizations have documented the Saudi authorities' regular use of torture to obtain confessions. In addition, there are no limits on pre-trial detention, detainees have no right of access to lawyers during interrogations and trials, and confessions can be the basis for conviction even when obtained through torture and when no corroborating evidence exists. The Department of State's Country Reports for Human Rights Practices for 1996 acknowledges that the reliance on confessions to convict creates """"a situation that repeatedly has led prosecuting authorities to coerce confessions from suspects by threats and abuse,""""and that """"[t]he legal system is subject to executive and royal family influence.""""  Detainees accused of """"crimes involving national security"""" do not benefit from even the minor protections provided by Saudi law, and are tried in special closed courts, if they receive trials at all. On May 31, 1996, Saudi Arabia beheaded four suspects in a 1995 bomb attack on the basis of confessions obtained after two months of incommunicado detention, and in December 1996, Saudi national Haytham al-Bahr died in detention, reportedly as a result of torture during questioning about his possible involvement in a Shi`a political movement.  In the light of this record, which is clearly well known to the U.S. government, we are concerned that the extradition of Hani Sayegh to Saudi Arabia would violate the U.S. obligation as a party to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Article 3 of which states, """"No State Party shall expel, return (""""refouler"""") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.""""  We also view with alarm press reports suggesting that U.S. officials are once again prepared to use the threat of deportation to Saudi Arabia to coerce Sayegh's cooperation. The Los Angeles Times, citing """"legal sources close to the case,"""" reported on September 9 that """"Justice Department officials apparently hope the threat of deportation to Saudi Arabia will prompt Sayegh to start cooperating with the U.S. authorities, possibly as part of a new plea agreement.""""  The paper quotes one of these """"sources"""" as saying, """"This is one way of putting pressure on the guy to see if he'll come around to being of assistance to them."""" Such an exploitation of a credible fear of torture and severe mistreatment is utterly inappropriate. For these reasons, we urge you to make clear that Saudi Arabia, because if its persistent and serious abuses of fundamental human rights, will not be considered a potential destination in any extradition or deportation hearings against Mr. Sayegh.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response. Sincerely, Kenneth Roth Executive Director","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Saudi Arabia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/09/08/tung-chee-hwas-hosts-should-press-him-rule-law","Tung Chee-Hwas Hosts Should Press Him on Rule of Law","Tung Chee-Hwa's Hosts Should Press Him on Rule of Law","","09/08/1997","(New York) - As Tung Chee-hwa arrives in Washington for his first visit to the United States as chief executive of China's """"Special Administrative Region"""" of Hong Kong, Human Rights Watch/Asia called on President Clinton, Members of the U.S. Congress, and business people to raise concerns with him about the erosion of legal safeguards to protect human rights. The SAR has been in existence for just over two months; it is far too early to judge the effects of the transition to Chinese rule on its autonomy. To all appearances, Hong Kong is no different than it was before July 1, 1997, and no dissidents have been arrested, demonstrations banned, or human rights organizations dissolved. The changes to the political and legal system that Tung has endorsed, however, weaken existing checks on executive authority, violate the internationally-recognized right to participate in government through freely elected representatives, undermine existing human rights protections, and lay the legal foundation for serious human rights violations in the future.  Weakening popular participation in government  As is by now well known, the 1992 reforms initiated by then-Governor Chris Patten that led to an increase in the number of popularly elected seats in the Legislative Council (Legco) in Hong Kong were rejected by China. In elections held in September 1995, pro-democracy parties won sixteen out of the twenty directly elected seats. In March 1996, the Preparatory Committee, a body hand-picked by China to handle transition matters, voted to disband the elected Legco and in December 1996, the committee empowered a selection committee to appoint a provisional legislature that would remain in place for one year. (Mr. Tung has now said that elections will take place in May 1998.) The provisional legislature began meeting immediately in China. Not only has the provisional legislature already passed laws which have far-reaching implications for civil liberties in Hong Kong, but it will also vote to replace itself with a system that will drastically reduce the number of directly elected seats. Under the terms of new voting laws presented to the public on August 15, two-thirds of the legislature's sixty seats are to be filled by """"functional constituencies"""" with a heavy business and corporate focus. The remainder are to be elected not through the """"one person, one vote"""" system that allowed pro-democracy candidates to sweep the polls in the 1995 elections, but in one of two possible systems, variations on proportional representation, that would reduce the number of seats held by the most popular pro-democracy groups. Following China's Lead On """"National Security""""  Many authoritarian governments, and China is one, use """"national security"""" grounds as a pretext for preventing political dissent. It was therefore particularly disturbing when last February, China's National People's Congress decided to amend two British colonial laws, the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance, that had in 1992 and 1995 respectively had been brought into conformity with Hong Kong's Bill of Rights. The proposed amendments would have made it possible for the SAR to ban demonstrations or dissolve associations on broadly-defined political grounds in the interests of """"national security."""" After a much-publicized """"consultation"""" process through which Mr. Tung invited public comment on the laws, some of the most egregious provisions in the draft were dropped. But even in their final form as passed by the provisional legislature on June 14, the laws have disturbing elements. Whereas before groups organizing protests had to merely notify the police of their plans, they now must receive permission from the police, which may be denied in the interests of national security. On July 18, the Commissioner of Police issued a document entitled """"Guidelines on 'National Security' in the Public Order Ordinance"""" in which he cited """"advocacy of independence for Taiwan or Tibet"""" as grounds for refusing permission to demonstrate. Although protests critical of China have taken place in Hong Kong since the transition, organizers have sometimes experienced difficulties in having venues approved and protesters have become self-consciously more muted in the message they bring to the streets.  Likewise, in the final version of the Societies Ordinance, the government is empowered to deny registration to a society whereas before, societies simply had to notify the government of their formation to have a legal and lawful existence. """"National security"""" is again grounds for denying registration, and societies deemed to be """"political organizations"""" are barred from receiving funds from abroad. Mr. Tung's consultation process did result in narrowing some of the definitions used. """"Political organization,"""" for example, was defined to meet only those organization which put up candidates for election to public office.  The focus on national security is particularly worrisome given the way that concept has been used in China to curb political dissent. Weakening Rights Protection China's National People's Congress (NPC), the provisional legislature, and Mr. Tung himself have taken several steps that undermine human rights protections in Hong Kong.  1. In February 1996, the NPC resolved to repeal key provisions of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights that effectively required Hong Kong's domestic laws to conform to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The repeal went into effect on July 1, 1997. 2. Although the Basic Law, the SAR's constitution, provided for the continued application of the ICCPR to Hong Kong after July 1 despite the fact that China is not a party, the Chinese government announced it would not submit reports on Hong Kong to the Human Rights Committee, the body set up under the ICCPR to monitor compliance with its provisions. 3. On July 16, the provisional legislature suspended four labor laws passed by the elected legislature in the days leading up to the handover. The laws would have brought Hong Kong into compliance with standards set by the International Labour Organisation. They explicitly guaranteed the right to union representation and collective bargaining, the right to conduct union activity on an employer's premises, and the right to be compensated for union work done during the course of the normal work day. The laws also altered previous legislation that had restricted union sovereignty and would have allowed unions to act without governmental approval on certain internal issues. 4. On August 29, Tung endorsed Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir's suggestion that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be reviewed. He cited the enormous change that developing nations have undergone and said, """"Human rights is not a monopoly of the West."""" Mahathir's statement, made at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Kuala Lumpur in July, was an ominous move on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the most important international human rights standard in existence.  Laws On Subversion, Secession and Official Secrets Article 23 of the Basic Law, completed after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown brought millions of Hong Kong residents to the streets in protest, requires the SAR to enact laws against treason, sedition, secession, subversion and theft of state secrets. Hong Kong already had laws on treason and sedition, which were amended and liberalized by the last elected legislature. No laws existed, however, for the crimes of secession and subversion. Tung Chee-hwa has said that such laws will only be enacted after legislative elections take place in 1998, but there is still a question of why such laws are needed at all. In authoritarian legal regimes, the offense of """"subversion"""" is often applied to acts of peaceful dissent against the ruling party. Likewise the crime of """"secession"""" is often misapplied to peaceful advocacy of independence for a territory. A secession law might well be used against campaigners for the independence of Taiwan or Tibet, for example, despite the fact that such advocacy would be entirely protected by the right of free expression set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the final days of the elected legislature, the British administration pushed a heavily-opposed Official Secrets Ordinance through the Legislative Council on June 4, 1997, a day when most members of the pro-democracy parties were absent commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. The act, modeled on much-criticized British legislation, criminalizes a broad sweep of activity, such as merely being """"in the neighborhood of...a prohibited place"""" for """"a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests"""" of Hong Kong, or obtaining or communicating any information at all that """"might be...useful to an enemy."""" Terms like """"interests"""" are undefined, and it is not even necessary to show that the act committed actually jeopardized Hong Kong's interests if the """"known character"""" of the accused would indicate that such was his or her intention. The law does not allow certain common defenses for the disclosure of official information, such as prior publication of the information. Independence of the Judiciary and the Integrity of the Basic Law In the face of these questionable laws, maintaining the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary is critical, but steps have already been taken to weaken that independence. In June 1995, China and Britain agreed on a Court of Final Appeal to replace the London-based Privy Council as the court of last resort. The Court of Final Appeal is ultimately responsible to the NPC, and it is that body that will have final say as to how laws passed by the Hong Kong legislature conform to the Basic Law. But Hong Kong courts are already showing a desire to avoid any possible political conflict. In mid-July 1997, in the case of Ma Wai Kwan, the Hong Kong Court of Appeals made a landmark decision on the legality of the provisional legislature. A criminal defendant had argued that laws, indictments and courts that existed prior to the transfer no longer existed because their continuation was adopted by the provisional legislature, and the legislature itself was in violation of the terms of the Basic Law. Although the court held that as the Basic Law provided for the continuity of all these institutions, it was unnecessary to consider the legality of the provisional legislature, it nevertheless went on to opine that the legislature was legal because it was established by a body authorized by the NPC and that SAR courts have no power to examine either the decisions or institutions created by the NPC. This decision went far beyond the questions presented by the case and essentially gave license to China's legislature to violate Hong Kong's Basic Law at will. The questions of the legality of the provisional legislature and the authority of the Hong Kong courts are likely to arise again. One likely case will be the Rights of Chinese national children with one Hong Kong parent, who under the Basic Law are entitled to immediate residency Rights in Hong Kong. The government has proposed, and the provisional legislature passed on July 10, an amendment to the immigration laws which would require even children already living in Hong Kong to leave and obtain from Chinese authorities after great delay a """"certificate of entitlement"""" before they would be allowed in the SAR legally.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

According to Moscow: Open Season, Closed City published today by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, under this system police routinely check passports on the basis of skin color, invade the privacy of homes, illegally detain and fine refugees, and beat detainees with impunity.  """"We do not question the need to monitor a civilian registration system, or to maintain law and order,"""" declared Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. """"We deplore, however, the predatory way the Moscow police go about it. For them, the registration system means open season on non-Muscovites and refugees, open season for violence and bribes."""" Most troubling is the Moscow police's utter disregard for asylum seekers who are recognized as refugees by the UNHCR. """"The police literally hound them in a most racist way, force them to pay 'fines' that are better described as extortion, and detain them routinely. We find appalling the Russian government's willingness to tolerate such a glaring violation of Russia's international obligations to protect refugees,"""" asserted Ms. Cartner. Moscow police routinely beat those stopped on passport checks. """"The beatings follow a clearly-defined pattern, which suggests that it is unofficially sanctioned by the city police authorities,"""" commented Ms. Cartner. """"Should the detainee dare question the validity of the check, or respond to denigrating and racist remarks, police commonly respond with violence."""" About 27,000 asylum seekers are registered by the UNHCR in Moscow, most of them in Moscow.  The report documents a well-established pattern of police """"visits"""" to private apartments--frequently with the threat of use of force-- to carry out passport and registration checks. After threats of violence or arrest, they require refugees to pay a monthly bribe to shield them from further harassment. This is a violation of the right to privacy, which is protected in international and Russian law.  The Moscow registration system requires all visitors to the city to register within twenty-four hours, limits visits to six months, and makes visitors from the CIS pay a fee of about US$43. Its severe restrictions on permanent residence permits and its refugee policy are designed to achieve zero-population growth in the country's most populous city. The Human Rights Watch/Helsinki report called """"discriminatory"""" the extra charge for CIS visitors, who do not need a visa to travel to Russia. """"The current version of the registration system is an open invitation for police abuse,"""" concluded Ms. Cartner. """"Police set the fines arbitrarily, and more often than not seem to pocket what they collect.""""  The organization called on a qualified institution in the international community, such as the World Bank, to conduct a study of Moscow and Moscow region's infrastructure, housing stock, public health situation and the impact of past and projected migration on these public services. Such a study would initiate a review of Moscow's registration system. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki recommendations include: To the City of Moscow and the Moscow Region: Cancel the discriminatory fee for temporary stays in Moscow imposed on non-Russian Federation citizens who enjoy visa-free travel to Russia; streamline fines for violators in order to curb arbitrary fines assigned by police; Provide to each unsuccessful applicant for a permanent or temporary residence permit a written, reasoned decision explaining fully how his or her permanent residence would harm the public health, public order, public morals, national security or the rights and freedoms of others. This document would be admissible in court reviews of registration cases; Instruct the Moscow Main Department of Internal Affairs (GUVD) to accept UNHCR refugee identification as valid and exhaustive documents for registration with the police. UVIR should place a representative at the offices of the Moscow Migration Service to carry out police registration. A committee of representatives from the GUVD and such law enforcement branches should meet regularly with refugee advocates, beginning within one month of the dissemination of such an instruction, to check implementation; Release all those held in detention and awaiting deportation on such grounds; Cease conducting passport checks in private homes; and Launch a special campaign to encourage victims of police abuse to report their claims. To the Federal Migration Service: Provide refugees and the internally displaced full, gratis and updated information on regions in Russia that are capable of receiving refugees and internally displaced persons. Such information would also include Russian and regional laws and normative acts concerning refugee policy, registration rules for permanent residence and temporary stays, and objective data about housing and job opportunities and other economic conditions in the regions. Points of distribution should include all regional migration service offices, Russian consulates abroad, and refugee and human rights organizations throughout Russia and the CIS. Provide full and true information on government-funded housing for refugees currently residing in Moscow hotels. In cooperation with refugee advocacy organizations, organize a conciliation commission that would investigate refugee claims of inappropriate, uninhabitable or non-existent housing assignments outside Moscow. To the Russian Federation Government: The Procuracy General should oversee a full review of police abuse related to the registration system and should launch applicable disciplinary administrative criminal action against violators; Conduct a full review of the degree to which Moscow's regulations and practices in the of area of registration diverge from federal laws and rules and in ways that violate freedom of movement, the right to privacy and refugee rights; Order the Moscow Migration Service to cease rejecting applications for asylum on the grounds that the applicant is not a resident of Moscow or has no close relatives in the city. Ensure that the Moscow city and region governments facilitate asylum seekers in remaining in Moscow until the end of the asylum process. Ensure that no refugees residing in Moscow hotels who challenge their new housing assignments are evicted from their premises without a housing assignment. To the UNHCR The High Commissioner should personally engage the Moscow city and Russian governments at the highest level to cease the illegal treatment of asylum seekers documented in this report and to secure guarantees that UNHCR refugee cards will be accepted as adequate identity documents.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Guatemala's Forgotten Children: Police Violence and Abuses in Detention, a 144-page report, analyzes human rights abuses that take place both on the street and in detention centers. Issued as the Guatemalan government prepares to implement a new Minors' Code, the report strongly criticizes the country's juvenile justice system, calling it not just ineffective but punitive as well. """"Guatemalan street children have nowhere to turn. Those who attack them enjoy impunity, and the legal system fails them completely,"""" charged José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas.  Guatemala is a signatory to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the country's justice system, rather than protect minors from abuse, often exacerbates violations, the study finds. """"Even innocent juveniles are treated harshly by the justice system,"""" declared Lois Whitman, director of the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project. """"Children can be rounded up arbitrarily and forced to spend many months being warehoused in this brutal system."""" Among the report's findings: Children who are arrested may spend many months in pre-adjudication detention, often because they simply have no family to claim them. When they do receive a hearing, their rights to due process, including access to representation, are frequently ignored. Children in protective custody are detained together with juvenile offenders. As a result, children who may have fled abusive homes are thrown into the same dreary facilities as are drug addicts, pickpockets, prostitutes, and violent offenders. Young children are frequently mixed with teenagers. Detention facilities do not offer any meaningful rehabilitation or education, nor do they provide psychological treatment or systematic vocational training. Children are crowded together in unsanitary conditions, vulnerable to mistreatment from staff and from other detainees. All of these conditions violate international law. Control over juvenile facilities has been virtually ceded to REMAR (Rehabilitación de los Marginados), a Spanish evangelical organization. Boys who had been held in REMAR detention facilities reported widespread use of beatings and other abuse. Despite numerous such reports, no Guatemalan authority is supervising the actions of REMAR in any of its facilities. In a welcome change from the usual impunity enjoyed by security force agents, three cases in which children were murdered in 1993 and 1995 resulted in recent murder convictions against private security guards. Most crimes against street children, however, remain unpunished, particularly when police were responsible for the abuses. In 1996, the Guatemalan legislature passed the Minors' Code, which is scheduled to take effect in September 1997 and contains a host of improvements for the treatment of Guatemalan children. If fully implemented, the abuses documented by Human Rights Watch would largely cease, the report concludes. Currently, however, Guatemalan officials only take seriously cases of human rights violations against children if outside pressure has been brought to bear.  Guatemala's Forgotten Children contains detailed recommendations for the Guatemalan government, the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union. Among them: General Recommendations to the Guatemalan Government: The government should take every step necessary to ensure that the new Minors' Code is fully implemented without delay. Current abusive practices should be halted immediately to conform to the requirements of international and Guatemalan law. Particular attention should be paid to the practices of the National Police, private security guards (for which the Interior Ministry holds regulatory responsibility), the Minors' Courts, all state-run juvenile detention facilities, and all privately operated custodial facilities that accept children sent by court order. In order to ascertain compliance with international and Guatemalan law, independent nongovernmental organizations, including international human rights monitors, should be allowed periodically to investigate the juvenile justice system in its entirety or in part, including juvenile detention facilities. These monitors should be permitted to conduct confidential interviews with detained children of their choosing, with the consent of the children involved.  The government should itself periodically initiate and/or undertake evaluations of the Guatemalan juvenile justice system, including juvenile detention facilities. The Public Ministry and the National Police should thoroughly and impartially investigate all allegations of crimes committed against street children. Complaints regarding police mistreatment of children should be investigated promptly and thoroughly. Where appropriate, disciplinary measures and criminal proceedings should be ordered. The current practice of investigating only those cases on which outside pressure is brought to bear must end immediately. All police officers should receive rigorous and periodic training in human rights, children's rights, and relations with street children. What constitutes abusive police behavior should be defined explicitly for all officers. Examples of abusive and prohibited behavior--including stealing, soliciting bribes, soliciting sex, sexual assault, physical beatings, and illegal detention--should be clearly explained. Female police officers should be recruited. When possible, police teams working the downtown Guatemala City area should be composed of at least one female, with the goal of reducing sexual violence by police officers against street girls. Immediate and concrete steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of the Office of Professional Responsibility of the National Police, and in particular the responsiveness of that office to complaints alleging police misconduct against children. Procedures should be implemented that will allow complainants and witnesses to protect their identities should they reasonably fear reprisals. Recommendations to the Guatemalan Government Regarding the Administration of Juvenile Justice: All children facing the possible deprivation of their liberty should be provided a lawyer. The practice of lengthy pre-adjudication detentions should be ended immediately. Detention pending trial should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period of time, in accordance with international law. Under no circumstances should a child be held pending adjudication for more than the thirty working days permitted under Guatemalan law, and detention of this length should be mandated only in exceptional cases. No children should be held in detention solely because they lack a responsible parent or guardian who is willing and/or able to take them home. Instead, foster care or other non-punitive custody arrangements should be provided. Until privately run REMAR centers are thoroughly investigated, monitored, overseen, and approved by the responsible Guatemalan authorities, no child should be sent by a judge to such a center. Even after such centers are approved and oversight is established, no child should be sent by a judge to a REMAR facility unless the child, in consultation with his or her attorney, so agrees. In the meantime, private or state-run alternatives to REMAR centers should be established as soon as possible, and should also be subject to a rigorous approval process and ongoing monitoring. Recommendations to the Guatemalan Government Regarding Juvenile Detention Centers: A full investigation into privately operated REMAR centers should be undertaken immediately, and the findings of that investigation publicized. Physical punishment or abuse of children by staff should be strictly prohibited at all facilities, whether private or state-run. Staff found to have abused children should be dismissed or otherwise disciplined, as appropriate. Where appropriate, criminal charges should be brought against offending staff members. Staff should be fully informed of the rules and consequences concerning physical abuse of children. A complaint system should be initiated that allows detained children to make confidential complaints to facility directors, to the Children's Rights Defender of the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, and/or to other appropriate national or international agencies. The system should ensure that all complaints are investigated and responded to promptly. The Children's Rights Defender should make unannounced inspections of all juvenile centers, and should intervene whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that abuses have been committed. Meaningful control and supervision over REMAR staff in state facilities should be implemented immediately. Any direct or indirect financial support to REMAR by the Guatemalan government should immediately cease. Should allegations of abuses by REMAR staff persist, the government should expel the organization from state facilities. In keeping with international children's rights norms, corporal punishment should never be used. Under no circumstances should isolation be used as a punitive measure. Physical and sexual abuse of detainees by other people in detention should be strictly guarded against by all appropriate means, including adequate staffing, rigorous monitoring, and the appropriate placement of children in facilities and dormitories. Meaningful educational and vocational training should be instituted at all facilities. Libraries and recreational activities should be made available to all children at all facilities. Each child should receive adequate medical care, including mental health care. Medical emergencies should be dealt with promptly, regardless of the child's economic status. Each detention facility should implement drug-abuse prevention and rehabilitation programs; these programs should be administered by qualified personnel. The government should collect and disseminate statistical data regarding children in detention. Such information should include: the reason for detention; the length of time in detention; the disposition of the case (i.e., measures imposed by judge); the frequency of review of these measures; family history; medical condition, including any substance addiction or abuse; previous detentions; and any complaints or concerns noted by the child. Recommendations to the European Union: The European Union should develop guidelines for ensuring that its funds are not and will not be utilized by a juvenile justice system that violates the human rights of detained children and youth. An important first step would be to commission a prompt and independent investigation of conditions in the juvenile justice system, with public findings and recommendations; the European Union should use its leverage to ensure that these recommendations are implemented. In particular, the European Union should vigorously protest the use of punitive isolation and physical punishment in children's centers, and insist on adequate state supervision and control over the centers. The European Union and all member states providing direct and indirect aid to Guatemalan law enforcement agencies should insist on significant improvement in police conduct toward street children. In particular, training programs provided by the Spanish Civil Guard to the National Police should incorporate instructions on coping with street children without abusing their rights. Failure to improve in this area would warrant a reconsideration of aid to the police. Recommendations to the United States: The United States government should review the effectiveness of the Office of Professional Responsibility of the police to determine why it has failed to adequately address police violence against street children. U.S. assistance to law enforcement agencies should include a component on the human rights of street children. Continued serious abuses by the police should prompt a reconsideration of aid.Recommendations to the United Nations: The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child should investigate police violence against Guatemalan street children. They should also evaluate the government's response to this violence, including efforts at prevention and sanctions against offending officers. The findings of these studies should be the basis for detailed and public recommendations to the government of Guatemala. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, and the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child should investigate conditions of detention for children in Guatemala, including, but not limited to, the use of corporal punishment and isolation. They should evaluate the government's response to illegal conditions and practices in juvenile detention facilities. Based on their findings, they should make detailed and public recommendations to the Guatemalan government. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child should investigate the extent to which due process protections are observed by the Guatemalan government in depriving children of their liberty. They should make detailed and public recommendations to the Guatemalan government, aimed at full and rapid observance of due process rights in the detention and confinement of children. The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child should devote a theme day to the topic of police violence against street children.","Americas, Guatemala","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

According to diplomatic sources, the investigative team in Kinshasa received a letter yesterday signed by Conogolese Minister of Reconstruction Etienne-Richard Mbaya and Minister of International Cooperation Thomas Kanza imposing three new conditions. In light of these latest demands imposed by the Congolese government Executive Director Kenneth Roth said, """"We believe that the time has come to stop making concessions in the face of this obstructionism."""" Instead of further delays, full cooperation with the U.N. investigative team should be insisted upon. Any attempt at negotiation would only embolden the government.

The full text of the letter follows.   August 28, 1997   H.E. Secretary-General Kofi Annan United Nations Headquarters New York, NY 10017   Dear Mr. Secretary General,   Human Rights Watch is gravely concerned about the most recent obstacles imposed by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the United Nations investigative team in that country. According to diplomatic sources, the Congolese government delivered to the team in Kinshasa yesterday a letter addressed to you and signed by Congolese Minister of Reconstruction Etienne-Richard Mbaya and Minister of International Cooperation Thomas Kanza. We understand the letter to have imposed three new conditions on the team's investigation:  It insisted on the replacement of the team's Togolese chairman, Mr. Atsu-Koffi Amega, by someone from a neutral country--an apparent allusion to Togo's close relationship with the prior Zairean government of former President Mobutu Sese Seko.  It insisted that the team's investigators not be accompanied by their unarmed U.N. security personnel.  It insisted that the U.N. investigation be conducted in conjunction with a proposed parallel investigation by the Organization of African Unity.   As you know, Human Rights Watch strongly objected to your initial decision to acquiesce in the Congolese government's objection to the participation of U.N. Special Rapporteur Roberto Garretón in the investigation of atrocities in Congo/Zaire. Our principal reason was that it set a terrible precedent of allowing a government under investigation for human rights abuses to play a role in selecting its investigator. Unfortunately, the Congolese government seems to have learned that lesson all too well, and is in the process of transferring it to other aspects of the investigation which should be of no legitimate concern to it. Indeed, the Congolese government's steady stream of objections to various aspects of the investigation suggests a determination to block any inquiry into the alleged acts of mass murder or to delay the inquiry sufficiently so that evidence of atrocities can be destroyed.   We believe that the time has come to stop making concessions in the face of this obstructionism. Your firm and immediate response to yesterday's insult is essential. We call on you to reject unequivocally these latest demands of the Congolese government and any new ones that it might impose, and to insist on its immediate and full cooperation with the U.N. investigative team. Any attempt at negotiation would only embolden the government and lead to further delays. Should the Congolese government persist in such stonewalling, we urge you to bring the matter to the attention of the Security Council and seek the imposition of firm sanctions.

This would include preventing other states from transferring the arms to the government of Sudan, to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, and to others fighting in Sudan.  A copy of the letter follows. August 28, 1997 President Nelson Mandela President Private Bag X83 Pretoria 0001 RE: Suggested end use restrictions regarding Sudan on transfers of South African arms  Dear President Mandela: Your Defence Minister Joe Modise was quoted by the South African Press Agency on August 7, 1997, as saying that the South African National Defense Forces (SANDF) is planning to sell excess anti-aircraft weapons, Buffel infantry vehicles, Puma helicopters, and other war materiel. Human Rights Watch writes to request that you do not transfer any weapons, either those mentioned or others, to any party to the conflict in Sudan. Both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) are guilty of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, as we have documented in numerous reports. We note that South Africa has a policy of not selling arms to the Sudanese government or to nongovernment forces. In order to guarantee that arms you sell do not end up in the hands of parties to the Sudanese conflict, we request that you impose restrictions on the end use of all arms your government sells, forbidding any recepient of South African arms from transfering or using, directly or indirectly, these weapons to or for the benefit of the parties to the Sudan conflict. In order to guarantee that this restriction is respected, we suggest that you adopt provisions such as those outlined in appendix A to this letter. The ban on weapons transfers also should be applied specifically to Sudanese militia groups and muraheleen (tribal militias) operating under government sponsorship or with implicit consent, and those former rebel groups now aligned with the government such as Riak Machar's United Democratic Salvation Front. It should be applied as well to the opposition coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which the SPLA is an important member.  We are particularly concerned about reports that the SPLA is now seeking to obtain anti-aircraft weapons to use in the siege of Juba, a southern garrison town in which at least 100,000 civilians reside; these civilians would be cut off from necessary airlifts of food should all air transport be prevented. The Sudanese government is said to be stepping up its use of helicopters in the war against the SPLA, and has shown no regard for civilian lives in its attacks to date. Furthermore, there is evidence that the Sudan government is supplying arms, including but not limited to land mines, to rebel groups in neighboring countries. One such group, the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, has a particularly bad record of abuses directed at children.  We note that you are now actively involved in the search for peace in Sudan. Although we do not take a position on peace negotiations, ceasefires, or the merits of the war, it is clear that the continuing flow of arms into Sudan, where the parties are already heavily armed, will do nothing to improve the lot of the civilians who have borne the brunt of the war for fourteen years. We therefore urge that you insure that no South African arms are used into this conflict. Sincerely, /s//s/ Peter TakirambuddeJoost Hiltermann Executive DirectorExecutive Director Human Rights Watch/AfricaHuman Rights Watch Arms Project Draft Provisions Suggested for Agreements Governing Arms Sales, Leases or Transfers between the Government of South Africa and Any Other Entity (""""Purchaser"""") 1.1 The Purchaser agrees, except as may otherwise be mutually agreed in writing, to use the defense articles sold, leased or transferred hereunder only  1.1.1 For internal security, individual self-defense, or civic action; 1.1.2 For national self-defense from foreign invasion; or 1.1.3 For peackeeping pursuant to a resolution by the United Nations Security Council, the Organization of African Unity, or the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development. 1.2 The Purchaser will not transfer title to, or possession of, the defense articles, components and associated support material, related training or other defense services or technology furnished under this agreement, to anyone who is not an officer, employer, or agent of the Purchaser (excluding transportation agencies), and shall not use or permit their use for purposes other than those authorized above, unless the written consent of the government of South Africa has first been obtained. The Purchaser agrees that the defense articles sold will not be transferred to any party to the conflict in Sudan, used inside the territory of Sudan (except as provided in 1.1.3 above), and recognizes that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the government of South Africa is required to be notified by the Purchaser of any substantial evidence that the defense articles sold, leased or transferred in this agreement have been used in a manner which is inconsistent with this provision. 1.3. The Purchaser agrees that the government of South Africa will assist it in observing and reporting on the utilization of defense articles and services acquired through sale, lease or other transfer from the government of South Africa. 1.3.1 The Purchaser agrees that it will cooperate fully with any agency designated by the government of South Africa to investigate wherther there has been a breach of the provision of this agreement relating to a prohibition on transfers of defense materials to any party to the conflict in Sudan, or the use of these defense materials inside the territory of Sudan. 1.4 The Purchaser agrees that when a South African-origin defense article has fulfilled its requirement and the Purchaser desires to dispose of the article, there are three proper methods to use: 1.4.1 The item may be destroyed with no recognizable residue (i.e., burned). 1.4.2 The military capability may be removed, whereby the item becomes eligible for transfer to a third party such as a scrap dealer. 1.4.3 The item, while retaining its military capability, may not be transferred to another country or armed group without prior written and public agreement with the government of South Africa.","Africa, South Africa",""

As a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the new government is obligated to ensure that Albanian law and the government's human rights practices conform with international standards. Addressing the following issues would demonstrate a willingness to respect Albania's legal obligations and mark a departure from the human rights record of the previous government. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki is strictly non-partisan and does not favor any political force in Albania or any other country. Our sole aim is to secure guarantees that the Albanian government, regardless of who is in power, respects its obligations under international law. Shooting of Mujo Buçpapaj On August 21, around 6:20 p.m., Mujo Bucçpapaj, a journalist with Rilindja Demokratike (the official newspaper of the opposition Democratic Party) was shot and seriously wounded while walking in Tirana with his wife and young child. According to the Buçpapaj family and a Democratic Party press statement, individuals from a police car fired at Mr. Buçpapaj, striking him in the leg. The Democratic Party believes that the attack was politically motivated. Police, however, maintain that Buçpapaj was either caught in crossfire or hit by a ricocheting bullet during a gun battle between two armed gangs. It is unclear whether Mr. Buçpapaj was indeed targeted or the unlucky victim of street violence. Because providing for the physical protection of journalists is critical for the protection of freedom of expression, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki urges the authorities to conduct a full and impartial investigation of the attack, make public the results, and hold accountable all those found responsible. Freedom of Expression in Television and Radio On August 19, the former speaker of parliament and current MP Pjeter Arbnori began a hunger strike to protest what he considers biased reporting against the Democratic Party on the state television. His action received coverage on state television's news, as have other Democratic Party complaints about media coverage. Under the new government, the state television and radio have generally provided more balanced reporting; nevertheless, Mr. Arbnori's strike underscores the importance of respecting and promoting freedom of expression in the broadcast media. Although a number of private television and radio stations now exist, their legal status remains unclear. Specifically, there is no clear procedure for obtaining a broadcast licence, which opens the door for the arbitrary denial of licences on political grounds. To ensure that a wide spectrum of views are represented in the media, the government should establish a broadcast regulatory authority that is independent of the executive branch or government. Such an agency should design licensing procedures and regulatory mechanisms that ensure non-discrimination in the awarding of licences and access to the airwaves for a diversity of information and views, including news and political opinions. Although it is not obligated to do so under international law, the government might also consider reform of state television and radio to ensure its political independence and objectivity. According to the Statutes for the Albanian Radio and Television, Article 3, """"The Albanian radio and television is a depoliticized institution where the activities of political parties are forbidden."""" Only lasting structural changes will guarantee that the state media do not become a political tool once again. The Press Law The new government should work to repeal or amend the press law, which the previous government adopted and used to imprison or fine journalists who expressed criticism of the state. The law states that the press is free but includes provisions that restrict access to information that is deemed a state secret, goes against the public good or would affect a court case in process. In the past, such vague terminology allowed the government to arbitrarily withhold information. According to Articles 21 and 22, violators of the law may be fined up to U.S. $8,000. Such an amount is grossly disproportionate to the income of an average journalist and would place an extraordinary financial burden on any Albanian publication, perhaps forcing it to close. Distribution of Newspapers For the past few months, Rilindja Demokratike and Albania, a newspaper closely tied to the Democratic Party, have complained that their delivery vans are not able to travel to the south of the country. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has not been able to confirm the allegation but believes that the government should investigate and take the appropriate steps to ensure that all printed media, regardless of its political content, is able to distribute unhindered. If individuals are blocking the newspapers, the government should take the necessary action to let the vans through.","Europe/Central Asia, Albania",""

The refugees, mostly Tutsi who had fled from the Congo during the preceding year, were sheltered in a camp not far from the Congo border. The insurgents, many of them soldiers of the former Rwandan government army (FAR) or members of militia that had participated in the 1994 genocide of Tutsi in Rwanda, reportedly attacked across the border from Congo, where some of them have retained a base after their camps were dispersed some months ago by soldiers of the ADFL forces. Authorities of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) have charged that local residents also participated in the killings at Mudende and have reportedly attacked or permitted Tutsi civilians to injure or kill these residents and to burn their homes.     The insurgents' predawn massacre of the refugees constitutes an inexcusable human rights abuse. The RPA attacks or permitting civilian attacks on local people in reprisal for the massacre violates international humanitarian law.     The number and scale of attacks that cost civilian lives in Rwanda have multiplied in the last several months. An August 7 report by the United Nations Human Rights Field Operation detailed the slaughter of more than 2,000 persons, most of them unarmed civilians killed by the RPA. August 8-11, RPA soldiers reportedly killed several hundred unarmed civilians, some by mortars fired into the market at Mahoko, others executed at jails in the communes of Rubavu and Kanama, all in Gisenyi prefecture. Armed insurgents also killed unarmed civilians during these incidents August 8-10 and attacked a school at Gisa on August 10.     Most attacks against civilians have taken place in the northwestern part of the country, but the international human rights organizations have just received reports of some thirty-nine persons killed at Muhazi in the eastern part of Rwanda. Human Rights Watch and FIDH deplore the continued delivery of arms to the region, including the recent resumption of arms sales to the Rwandan government by South Africa -- exacerbating the situation and facilitating the use of deadly force against unarmed civilians.     General Paul Kagame, Vice-President of Rwanda and Minister of Defense, went to investigate the August 8-10 incidents in Gisenyi. The Rwandan government has arrested a number of its soldiers, reportedly either thirteen or fifteen of them, including a lieutenant-colonel, in connection with these incidents.    RECOMMENDATIONS    To the insurgents:    Order your troops to stop killing unarmed civilians immediately.  Investigate the violation of international humanitarian law by members of your forces who commit such killings and hold them accountable in procedures that meet the minimum standards of due process established in international humanitarian law.   To the government of Rwanda:    Order RPA troops to stop killings and other reprisals against the civilian population. Order them to prevent any such attacks by Tutsi civilians.   Carry out a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation of any killings of civilians and make public the findings. Continue to arrest and bring to trial as soon as possible all those apparently implicated in the incidents.   Guarantee full access to U.N. and nongovernmental human rights monitors, to organizations providing humanitarian aid, and to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection officers.   Ensure that RPA soldiers and police provide protection to refugees and displaced persons.

Human Rights Watch urges the government to release protest organizers detained under counter-terrorism legislation, including a human rights activist, three lawyers and a journalist, and to investigate and prosecute instances where detained activists have been beaten and otherwise abused. The organization also demands the government halt its harassment of the relatives of protest leaders. A copy of the letter is attached. ### August 23, 1997 His Excellency Hosni Mubarak President of the Arab Republic of Egypt c/o His Excellency Ahmed Maher El Sayed Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt 3251 International Court, N.W. Washington, DC 20008 Your Excellency: Human Rights Watch is increasingly concerned about measures taken by Egyptian authorities to thwart peaceful protests against Law No. 96 of 1992. This law, scheduled to go into effect in October, abolishes rent control on agricultural land and permits landowners to evict tenant farmers. Farmers themselves, and various opposition groups, have organized protests against the law. Protests have occasionally been violent; several government-owned agricultural cooperatives have been burned. According to the independent Land Center for Human Rights, thirteen people have been killed and over sixty have been injured in rural unrest. However, those who have protested peacefully have also been targeted for intimidation, arrest and harassment. Hundreds of tenant farmers and supporters have been detained, over 150 of whom remain in detention. Farmers interviewed by Human Rights Watch in July described a campaign led by State Security Investigation (SSI) personnel, local police, and landowners to suppress protest by forcing farmers to remove black flags symbolizing opposition to the law, detaining local activists without charge, interfering with peaceful demonstrations by rounding up leaders ahead of planned days of protest, and threatening farmers if they involved themselves in protest activities. Human Rights Watch has on two occasions in recent months written Your Excellency about the arrest and ill-treatment of activists peacefully protesting this law. On May 15, we sent a letter protesting the detention of Cairo University Professor Ahmed al-Ahwany, arrested on April 24 after photocopying a paper critical of the reform law. Al-Ahwany was charged under provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting the dissemination of """"false or biased news"""" and """"inciteful propaganda,"""" and ordered held by the State Security Prosecutor for thirty days. On June 27, we again wrote Your Excellency, this time regarding the arrest of four other agrarian activists. In the early morning hours of June 17, in a coordinated operation, separate groups of SSI officers in Cairo and in Qalyoubiya province arrested journalist Hamdin Sabbahi, director of Al-Watan Al-Arabi Information Center, lawyers Hamdi Haikal and Muhammad Fayad, and veterinarian Muhammad Abdu. They were charged under Articles 86(bis) and 86(bis)(a) of the Penal Code--provisions introduced by 1992 counter-terrorism legislation--for """"promoting ideas intended to incite a social class to use violence against other classes,"""" """"acquiring printed materials prepared for distribution"""" furthering those ideas, and related charges. These activists remain in detention more than two months after their arrest. Human Rights Watch thus received with concern the news that Sayyid Ahmad Al-Toukhi, a twenty-nine-year-old lawyer and researcher at the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), was arrested on August 9 at Cairo International Airport, apparently for his involvement in opposing the land law. Egyptian authorities first attempted to arrest Al-Toukhi on June 17, the day that Sabbahi and his colleagues were arrested. According to our information, Al-Toukhi was for several years a member of the Nasserist party and a leader of its youth movement, and has recently been involved in the campaign against Law 96. For example, last June, Al-Toukhi attended a political conference in Banha in Qalyoubiya province to discuss the impact of Law No. 96. According to the EOHR, which is monitoring the case, State Security Prosecutors issued a fifteen-day detention order for Al-Toukhi, also charging him under Article 86(bis) of the Penal Code. Human Rights Watch has previously protested arrests of activists on the basis of vaguely worded charges such as those that appear in Article 86(bis), which we find in conflict with the right of freedom of expression guaranteed in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt is a party. According to testimony that we obtained, SSI targeted Al-Toukhi's family--detaining two of his brothers, and beating one of them--in the weeks before his arrest as a means of discovering Sayyid's whereabouts and pressuring him to give himself up. Human Rights Watch has extensively documented this particular practice of SSI, and we are disturbed to learn that it continues. Al-Toukhi Ahmad Al-Toukhi, the brother of the detained activist, told Human Rights Watch that on June 17, the night of the arrest of Sabbahi and his three colleagues, a group of three plainclothes officers of the SSI, accompanied by about twenty armed conscripts, broke down the door to the family home at 2 am. The frightened family members awoke to find strangers in their home asking, """"Where is Sayyid?"""" Though Sayyid was not at home at the time, SSI officers searched the house and took several documents belonging to him. After Sayyid's brother Al-Toukhi Ahmad asked to see an arrest warrant, the officers arrested him and took him outside. They blindfolded him, detained him for two hours in the Qalyoubiya SSI office, and then transferred him to the Gabr ibn Hayyan SSI office in Giza. While interrogating him about Sayyid's whereabouts, Hamdin Sabbahi's activities, and his own political role in the agrarian protest movement, guards beat him on the head with shoes and on different parts of his body with a belt. A week later, about fourteen security force members entered the family home at 1:00 a.m. looking for Sayyid. Al-Toukhi Ahmad's mother, who attempted to resist this force, was pushed to the ground. Her screams alerted neighbors and the force withdrew hastily from the scene, taking Sayyid's eleven-year-old brother whom they detained overnight. When his elder brother Al-Toukhi Ahmad went to fetch him the following morning, the child was released in exchange for Al-Toukhi, who was held for another twelve hours and then released. Human Rights Watch is also concerned about reports that some of the detained activists have been abused while in prison. In our letter of June 27, we wrote that on June 18 a large number of security personnel under the supervision of police officer Muhammad Muhammad Salim beat the four activists mentioned above (Sabbahi, Haikal, Fayad, and Abdu) for four hours with sticks, fists and boots, according to Sabbahi. Prosecutor General Raga Al-Arabi has opened a file on the beatings, which included an official forensic medical examination of the four and the questioning of the victims and witnesses. Though two months have passed since the incident, Human Rights Watch has received no information about the outcome of the prosecutor general's investigation or about steps taken to bring those suspected of abuse to justice. More recently, Human Rights Watch has received reports that prison guards in Mahkoum Al-Tora prison, where Sayyid Al-Toukhi was held for a number of days, shaved his head and locked him in a cell full of rubbish during the night of August 12. Two days later, the State Security Prosecutor denied the EOHR permission to visit Al-Toukhi. Al-Toukhi is currently in Tora Mazra'a prison, where an EOHR representative was finally able to visit him on August 20. Human Rights Watch is also concerned that Egyptian authorities may have intentionally misled lawyers for Sabbahi, Haikal, Fayad and Abdu in order to prevent their appearance at an August 14 court hearing to extend their clients' detention order for another forty-five days. Defense lawyers followed instructions to appear at the North Giza Court. However, the lawyers later learned that the South Giza Court--which according to EOHR Secretary-General Mohammad Monieb did not have jurisdiction over the case--had ruled in favor of the prosecution without the attendance of any defense lawyers at a hearing held before regular court hours. Human Rights Watch respectfully urges Egyptian authorities to respect international human rights standards that guarantee freedom of expression, including the right of citizens peacefully to protest government policies. We condemn the continuing attempts by the state to intimidate activists and tenant farmers who seek to challenge in a peaceful manner the implementation of Law No. 96. Human Rights Watch calls for the release of lawyers Sayyid Ahmad al-Toukhi, Hamdi Haikal and Muhammad Fayad, journalist Hamdin Sabbahi, and veterinarian Muhammad Abdu. We further recommend a full, prompt, and transparent official investigation of the beating and other ill-treatment of these detainees in prison, and prosecution of all security personnel involved in ordering or carrying out the abuse. We further call upon Egyptian authorities to investigate SSI's practice of harassing family members, including hostage-taking of children, detentions, and beatings, meant to put pressure on relatives to turn themselves in, and to bring these practices to an immediate halt. We thank you for your consideration and welcome your comments.

The first of these incidents took place just one day after the United Nations Human Rights Field Operation (HRFOR) published a report documenting the massacre by RPA soldiers of more than 2,000 persons, many of them unarmed children, women and the elderly in northwestern Rwanda during the preceding months.     These massacres took place in the context of a continuing armed struggle between RPA soldiers and armed groups composed largely of soldiers of the former Rwandan government (ex-FAR) and of members of the militia that participated in the 1994 genocide of Rwandan Tutsi. The Rwandan government has the right and duty to protect its citizens, but such defense must be conducted within the parameters of international humanitarian law: there is no excuse for killing unarmed civilians or combatants who have laid down their arms. The slaughter of unarmed civilians by the insurgents is similarly an inexcusable human rights abuse.     The number and scale of attacks that cost civilian lives have multiplied in the last several months. Human Rights Watch and FIDH deplore the continued delivery of arms to the region, including the recent resumption of arms sales to the Rwandan government by South Africa -- exacerbating the situation and facilitating the use of deadly force against unarmed civilians.     According to reports from a number of independent sources, including diplomats in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, RPA soldiers and insurgents exchanged fire in the crowded market of Mahoko at 10 am August 8. One report states that the firing continued for two hours and that the RPA fired mortars into the market. Independent sources estimate that 400 people were slain, most of them unarmed civilians. Rwandan authorities declare that """"several"""" civilians were killed in the incident.     Later that day, armed rebels attacked the commune jail in Rubavu where hundreds of persons were detained on charges of having participated in the 1994 genocide. Witnesses declare that RPA soldiers drove away the rebels and then killed 200 to 300 detainees. Rwandan authorities reportedly admit that 185 detainees were killed but say the insurgents were responsible for these deaths. According to these official accounts, RPA troops had withdrawn from the immediate vicinity of the jail in order to regroup. In their absence, the insurgents took over the jail, liberated the detainees, and killed those who refused to join forces with them.     Rwandan authorities admit that at least ninety-five detainees were also killed at the commune jail at Kanama that same afternoon. Preliminary independent reports put the number of fatalities from this incident at approximately 200.     Authorities ordered the local population to bury the dead in mass graves in each community. Witnesses report that gunfire was also heard on August 8 and 9 in Muhira, Bisezi, Kanzenze and Nyundo sectors.     That evening and the next day, reportedly drunk RPA soldiers looted throughout the area.     According to the testimony received by Human Rights Watch and FIDH, the RPA moved armed personnel carriers into the area on August 9 and witnesses report having heard mortar fire. These accounts state that the RPA deliberately killed an undetermined number of civilians on August 9, some of whom were apparently identified on a list as persons to target.     On August 10, at 7 pm, the insurgents attacked a school at Gisa, where students were meeting with an officer of the national police. Reports do not indicate the number of persons killed or wounded in this attack.     Reports indicate that large numbers of people have fled their homes, some heading for the town of Gisenyi, others moving west towards the border with Congo.     The Rwandan government has arrested thirteen of its soldiers in connection with these incidents.    RECOMMENDATIONS    To the government of Rwanda:    Order RPA troops to stop killing unarmed civilians immediately.   Carry out a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation of these killings and make public the findings. Continue to arrest and bring to trial as soon as possible all those apparently implicated in the incidents.   Guarantee full access to U.N. and nongovernmental human rights monitors, to organizations providing humanitarian aid, and to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection officers.   To the insurgents:    Order your troops to stop killing unarmed civilians immediately.   To the international community:    Bring all possible pressure to bear on the Rwandan government and the insurgents to halt the slaughter of unarmed civilians and to observe international humanitarian law. Condition financial and other assistance on a halt to these killings.   To the United Nations:    Revive the International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda), implement the important recommendations it made in 1996, and provide it with a new mandate to investigate arms trafficking in the Great Lakes region (including Rwanda, Burundi and Congo) and propose to the Security Council specific and concrete measures aimed at curbing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the area.   The Human Rights Field Operation should publish immediately and fully all available information related to deliberate killings of civilians.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"

Government officials recently warned Mr. Shamlan, a leading defense lawyer and critic of the government, to cease his efforts to present a petition to the Amir, reportedly signed by more than 20,000 Bahrainis, requesting restoration of Bahrain's partially elected National Assembly. When Mr. Shamlan declined, he was told he could not leave on a planned visit to France for medical and other purposes, and he subsequently suffered a serious stroke. In the letter, Human Rights Watch calls on Shaikh Isa to instruct the ministry of interior """"to cease its harassment of Mr. Shamlan for attempting to exercise his rights to freedom of expression and opinion and to peaceful assembly and association"""" A copy of the letter is attached. August 15, 1997 Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa Office of His Highness the Amir Rifa'a Palace Bahrain by facsimile: 973 668 884 Your Highness: We are writing you with regard to Mr. Ahmad Isa al-Shamlan, who was recently informed by a high official in your government that, because of his views critical of the government, he is presently not permitted to travel outside of the country. Mr. Shamlan has not been charged with any offense which might justify this restriction. Such abridgement of Mr. Shamlan's right to freedom of movement on grounds of his political opinion contravenes Article 13 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Bahrain has pledged to uphold. Article 2 of the Universal Declaration states that all persons are entitled to this and other specified rights """"without distinction of any kind,"""" including """"political or other opinion."""" We therefore respectfully urge your government to assure Mr. Shamlan that there will be no restriction on his right to travel abroad if he so wishes. We further ask that you instruct the government, and in particular the ministry of interior, to cease its harassment of Mr. Shamlan for attempting to exercise his rights to freedom of expression and opinion and to peaceful assembly and association. Mr. Shamlan, a defense lawyer and columnist, has long been active in the campaign to restore the partially elected National Assembly mandated by Bahrain's Constitution. He and his family had been scheduled to fly from Manama shortly after midnight on July 31 to France for medical examinations and a vacation. On July 30, at around noon, Mr. Shamlan received a telephone call from Abd al-Aziz Atiyatallah Al Khalifa, governor of Manama province. Governor Atiyatallah told Shamlan that he would not be allowed to leave the country. Mr. Shamlan urged his wife to travel without him, but several hours later he suffered a serious stroke and was hospitalized. We understand that he has recently been released from the hospital and is presently recovering at home. Prior to this phone call, on the previous evening, July 29, Mr. Shamlan and Mr. Ibrahim Kamal Eddin, a businessman, had been summoned by Governor Atiyatallah to the Hura police station in Manama for a meeting that lasted until after midnight. At this meeting, Governor Atiyatallah, a long-time high official in the ministry of interior prior to his appointment as governor this year, warned the two men that they should cease their recent efforts to arrange a meeting with Your Highness to present a petition, reportedly signed by more than 20,000 citizens, requesting you to reinstate the National Assembly and implement other political reforms. When the two men indicated that they intended to continue their political reform efforts, Governor Atiyatallah reportedly told Mr. Shamlan to """"think of your health."""" When Mr. Shamlan asked if this was a threat to prevent him from travelling, the governor responded that it was not. The next day, however, the governor phoned Mr. Shamlan to say that in fact he would be prevented from leaving. Mr. Shamlan, who is in his mid-fifties, has been detained many times for his non-violent political opposition to the government. Most recently, on February 7, 1996, he was arrested following the publication by Agence France-Presse of a statement of the Popular Petition Committee, in which he is a leading figure. He had been scheduled to speak a few days later at a public seminar entitled """"Democracy and Shura"""" sponsored by the Uruba Club, a gathering which the government then prohibited from taking place. Mr. Shamlan was brought before the State Security Court on charges emanating from a newspaper column he had written a year earlier and from his possession of the statement of the Popular Petition Committee. The court acquitted Mr. Shamlan of all charges in May 1996, but he told Human Rights Watch subsequently that because of continuing government harassment he did not feel free to express his views concerning the political crisis in Bahrain.  When Mr. Shamlan and his colleagues renewed their efforts in early July of this year to arrange a meeting with Your Highness, he received a phone call from Abd al-Latif al-Rumaihi, the head of the prime minister's office, insisting that they abandon this effort. The July 29 summons from Governor Atiyatallah followed. Even prior to this recent stroke, Mr. Shamlan's health was poor. He had undergone heart surgery within the previous twelve months. We understand that the Bahrain Bar Association has recently written the minister of justice requesting that Mr. Shamlan be allowed to leave the country for medical treatment as soon as his current health permits.  While we would similarly urge you to permit him to travel on humanitarian grounds, we wish to stress that, so far as we are aware, the government of Bahrain has no legitimate grounds on which to restrict Mr. Shamlan's right to freedom of movement, including the right to travel abroad and to return to Bahrain. If your government is not prepared to allow Mr. Shamlan to travel at this time, we would appreciate receiving an explanation for this measure. We thank you in advance for your attention to this matter, and look forward to your response.

The court also handed down prison sentences of up to life at hard labor to three other defendants tried in the same case. Human Rights Watch also criticized the public screening before the trial of Sawalha's confessions as an ominous development"""" that can only discredit the reputation of the Palestinian judiciary""""; It urged President Arafat to ensure a halt to this practice, which violates a detainee's right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.  The Nablus military court, basing its convictions on the defendants' confessions and prosecution witness statements, rejected the defendants' claims that their admissions had been extracted under torture and threats.  A copy of the letter follows. August 14, 1997 President Yasser Arafat Palestinian Authority Gaza Strip, Gaza Via post and facsimile Dear President Arafat:  We are writing with regard to the military trial and judgment of four persons working or associated with the Palestinian Force 17 in Nablus who were convicted and sentenced two days ago on treason and terrorism charges. One of them, Fawzi Mohammed Mahmoud Sawalha, has been sentenced to death, and the others handed prison sentences of up to life at hard labor in a military trial that fell well short of international standards for a fair trial.  Sawalha, age 23, and Khaldun Sami Abdel Salam Uthamna, age 24, were charged with terrorism, treason, and spreading false information in order to undermine the prestige of the Palestinian Authority, all of which can carry the death penalty according to Articles 174, 131/A and 164/B of the Palestinian Liberation Organization penal code. Taher Ahmed Sherif Jamlan, a Force 17 agent, was charged with terrorism and treason, and Nasser Rashid Hamadna, a civilian, was charged with terrorism. While cognizant of the gravity of the offenses that the defendants are alleged to have committed, we believe that they should be granted new trials that comport with international standards for a fair trial. The shortcomings in their detention and trial were numerous and serious:  * The presiding judge at their trial failed to allow a medical examination of the detainees by an independent physician to assess their claims that they had been tortured during interrogation. This was despite the fact that the four defendants withdrew their confessions after the first court session, claiming they had been made under duress and torture at the police criminal investigation center in Nablus, including hammer blows to the head and whippings. They testified that they had also been subjected to shabeh, in which the detainee is hooded and shackled or confined in an unnatural and uncomfortable position. Some of the defendants said the interrogators threatened to rape their sisters and all of them said they had been threatened that they would be killed unless they pled guilty. Two of the defendants, Fawzi Sawalha and Khaldun Uthamna, claimed that due to severe stomach pains caused by heavy beatings, they had been transferred to the government-run Rafidia Hospital in Nablus and to a private clinic in Balata Camp respectively. Uthamna testified that he was once taken from the police criminal investigation center to outlying fields at night for more beatings. In coordination with the other defense lawyers, Sawalha's lawyer requested a medical examination by an independent physician, and repeated the request in subsequent court sessions. A medical examination before the start of the trial performed by a physician from Rafidia Hospital, which is run by the Palestinian Authority, concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate the defendants' claims of torture. The same physician later testified in court. The judge rejected the lawyers'; request for an independent examination and did not rule out the confessions as evidence. This prompts concern that the court disregarded the principle found in Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment. That article provides that """"any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings..."""" Article 13 of that Convention states that """"any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities."""" According to information we have received from lawyers, human rights activists, relatives of the defendants, and the media, the court based its conviction both on the defendants' confessions and on witness accounts. But, according to our information, none of the prosecution witnesses was able to identify the defendants or confirm they were the perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused. * In flagrant disregard of the right of defendants to be presumed innocent, a videotaped confession by Fawzi Sawalha was broadcast on a local Nablus television station on July 6, before the start of the trial. Sawalha was arrested on June 29 and held at the Nablus police criminal investigation center. He reportedly confessed to having led a group of masked men on rampages through the village of 'Assira al-Shemaliya in the northern Nablus governorate, beating up people and spreading terror. The screening of his confession was part of a program in which the head of the Nablus police criminal investigation division, Colonel Jihad al-Misaimi, was interviewed on the case by callers to the station. We are deeply concerned by this televised confession, which contradicts Article 14.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states: """"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law."""" In addition, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, in its General Comment 13(21) on Article 14.2, stated, """"It is, therefore, a duty of all public officials to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial."""" We strongly urge that security officials be prohibited from passing videotaped confessions to the media of detainees who have not been tried. * While in detention, guards did not permit Sawalha more than a few minutes privacy with his visitors, including lawyers and family members, and remained within earshot during most of the visits. These practices violate the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, Principle 18 of which states: """"The right of a detained or imprisoned person to be visited by and to consult and communicate, without delay or censorship and in full confidentiality, with his legal consul may not be suspended."""" The same principle stresses in paragraph 4 that: """"Interviews between a detained or imprisoned person and his legal counsel may be within sight but not within hearing of a law enforcement official."""" The lack of privacy inhibits the defendant from fully communicating with his lawyer. The concerns we have enumerated are deepened in light of the imposition of the death penalty against one of the defendants. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, because of its inherent cruelty and irreversibility. International human rights law, as codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, favors the abolition of capital punishment, although it does not prohibit it categorically. We wish to remind you that the Palestinian Authority committed itself under the Oslo Accords to carry out its responsibilities with due regard to international principles of human rights and rule of law. On October 2, 1993, shortly after signing the Declaration of Principles, Your Excellency announced that the Palestine Liberation Organization was committed to respect all internationally recognized human rights standards and wished to incorporate them into Palestinian legislation. We therefore urge a commutation of the death sentence against Sawalha. It is our fervent hope as well that all four defendants will benefit from a new trial that comports with fair-trial standards, and that their claims that torture was used to obtain confessions are thoroughly investigated. Article 12 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment states: """"Each State Party shall ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.""""The findings of such an investigation should be made public, and anyone found guilty of torture punished.  Finally, we respectfully urge you to intervene to halt the practice of allowing confessions to be televised before trial, a practice that can only discredit the reputation of the Palestinian judiciary.

In a report issued August 7, HRFOR states that at least 2,022 persons were killed in May and June during operations of the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) in Ruhengeri prefecture. According to eyewitnesses, many of those killed were unarmed civilians, including children, women and the elderly. Others were insurgents who were waging armed struggle against the government of Rwanda.     In letters to General Kagame and President Bizimungu, the two international human rights organizations wrote:     The report has been in the hands of Rwandan authorities since July 21 and its publication was twice delayed to permit them to prepare an appropriate response, but thus far they have responded only that the sources of information were not reliable and that the investigators did not understand the country. Such a vague and superficial response fails to counter the highly detailed investigative report, which cites dates of the incidents and numbers of alleged casualties by sector. Should such an inadequate response stand, it would show clearly that Rwandan authorities do not take complaints of human rights abuses seriously.     The organizations note that Rwandan government representatives have conceded that the RPA killed more than 2,000 persons in Ruhengeri during the period in question but claim that only 200 to 300 of those killed were civilians. Human Rights Watch and FIDH declared:     The assertion that some 1800 of the more than 2000 killed by the RPA were all members of armed groups cannot be simply and unquestioningly accepted, given the amount and weight of testimony to the contrary.     They continued:     We do not question the right and obligation of the Rwandan government to protect its people. Nor do we doubt that armed groups have increased the frequency and severity of their attacks in recent months. As you know, our organizations have long warned of the risk of resumed combat as increased amounts of arms have flowed to the region and we have campaigned to end this traffic in weapons. But Rwandan authorities must exercise their right and duty to protect the citizens of Rwanda within the limits set by international humanitarian law, which Rwanda has formally accepted.     Human Rights Watch and FIDH wrote to General Kagame:     As a senior commanding officer and Minister of Defense, you are responsible for ensuring that RPA forces know the limits of international humanitarian law and act within them. Although Rwandan authorities challenge charges by HRFOR that substantial numbers of unarmed civilians were killed, they do admit that RPA forces slaughtered 200 to 300 civilians, killings that clearly violation international humanitarian law. You have a duty to order that these killings of unarmed civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law cease and to see that the order is obeyed. You also have the responsibility for ordering a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into these massacres and for seeing that the commanding officers in charge of the operations are brought to justice.     The human rights organizations asked General Kagame and President Bizimungu to inform them how and when they would implement measures to ensure that RPA forces comply with international humanitarian law. They asked to be notified as well about when the investigations are to begin and the names and ranks of the officers in charge so that they can follow the progress of the inquiry.    Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH)   The International Federation of Human Rights is an international nongovernmental organization for the defense of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.

""""The case of Sheremet, Dmitry Zavadsky and Yaroslav Ovchinnikov is now our top concern in Belarus,"""" declared Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. Sheremet, a correspondent for ORT (Russian Public Television) Ovchinnikov, a cameraman, and Zavadsky, a driver, were arrested July 24 allegedly for illegal border crossing. """"His arrest signifies the Belarusian governments' total lack of respect for free expression and demonstrates its deplorable refusal to restore the rule of law."""" Jonathan Fanton, chair of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki's advisory committee, was in Belarus last week to release a 52-page report, Belarus: Crushing Civil Society. """"After illegally stripping Sheremet of his accreditation, the Belarusian government is now prosecuting him under the pretext of border violations, when in fact this attack is in direct response to his professional work and his criticism of government policies,"""" he stated. """"This was our message to the procuracy, the presidential administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Justice."""" Deputy Procurator General A.V. Ivanovsky denied Fanton's request to visit Sheremet in detention, citing the """"stage of the investigation."""" In a meeting with Mr. Ivanovsky, Human Rights Watch stressed that even if Sheremet did illegally cross the Lithuanian-Belarusian border, his detention is illegal; violating border regulations is a minor offence for which the use of custody is clearly disproportionate. Ivanovsky replied that the local procurator's office decides which measure of restraint to apply and refused to interfere.  Attempts by the Belarusian authorities to justify the journalists' continued arrest have not allayed Human Rights Watch/Helsinkiµs concerns. """"The fact that fifteen journalists who-like we did - protested Sheremetµs detention, were arrested and subsequently tried on the basis of an unlawful presidential decree, shows once more that stated commitments to press freedom by the Belarusian government are completely empty,"""" declared Fanton, referring to the brief detention on July 31 and the fining of journalists in Minsk for holding an """"unsanctioned demonstration"""" and chalking """"Free Sheremet"""" on the sidewalk. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki earlier wrote to President Lukashenka protesting the revocation of Sheremet's accreditation by the Belarusian authorities. In the letter, dated July 22, Human Rights Watch characterized the allegations against Sheremet as """"unfounded and ... designed to silence criticism of you and your government."""" Stripping Sheremet of his accreditation, tha same action taken against NTV correspondent Aleksandr Stupnikov in April, is in """"flagrant violation"""" of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Human Rights Watch/Helsinki's delegation visited Minsk from July 28 to August 1, 1997, to present Crushing Civil Society to the Belarusian government. The report describes in detail a series of attacks on the media in Belarus. It also documents attempts by the Belarusian authorities to destroy nongovernmental organizations, arbitrary arrests and excessive police violence at and around demonstrations, and blatantly unfair trials. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has already written to the European Union urging that international organization to take appropriate steps with respect to Belarus.","Europe/Central Asia, Belarus",""

An intensification of the long-standing policy of """"closure"""", these new measures reduce whole communities to a form of town arrest, imposing hardship on hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. That hardship seems wholly disproportionate to the security gains that these measures might provide Israel toward the objectives of apprehending the individuals thought resonsible for the bombing or preventing future attacks inside Israel. One senior Israeli security official, insisting on anonymity, told the Washington Post that Israel's strategy was to ensure that every Palestinian """"realizes this is going to have a very negative effect on the well-being of the entire population."""" By blocking the movement of people and goods, including food and medical supplies, Israel is indiscriminately punishing entire communities and violating its obligations as an occupying power under international humanitarian law to ensure that the food and health needs of the population can be met and to refrain from imposing collective penalties. As a result of the internal closure, doctors and nurses as well as Palestinians seeking medical treatment have been unable to get to hospitals and clinics. Officials of Ahli Hospital in Hebron told Human Rights Watch that their medical staff had been reduced by more than 60 percent. On the second day of the closure, a vehicle carrying a four-year-old boy injured in an automobile accident was delayed at a checkpoint for three hours, and the boy died before reaching Ahli Hospital, according to Palestinian human rights workers and hospital officials. Farmers are blocked from getting to their fields, many of which are in areas under Israeli control, and from securing supplies and credits in the cities under the Palestinian Authority. Fieldworkers from Palestinian human rights organizations report growing shortages in food markets in the West Bank, while in Gaza the inability to export has led to severe losses for agriculturalists. Classes at Bir Zeit University have been suspended since neither students nor teachers can reach the school. Since July 30, according to the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, at least sixteen Palestinian homes have been demolished by the Israeli authorities on the grounds that they lacked requisite building permits. In at least some of these cases, several Palestinian human rights organizations report, the closure has prevented homeowners and their lawyers from mounting legal challenges to the demolition orders. This total closure is an intensified version of the general policy of closure that Israel has imposed on the occupied West Bank and Gaza since March 1993. Human Rights Watch has documented ways in which this general closure, now more than four years old, has caused protracted hardship and, in some cases, humanitarian crises and avoidable deaths.  Human Rights Watch again urges the government of Israel to refrain from imposing restrictions on Palestinian movement between and within the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, except when the measures imposed are tailored to preventing specific acts or threats against Israeli security. Such restrictions must be weighed against Israel's obligation as an occupying power to attend to the welfare of the population under its rule. Human Rights Watch further reminds all governments of the international community of their obligations as High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to ensure that Israeli-imposed restrictions on movement between and within the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, comply with international law and Israel's continuing obligations toward the population under occupation. The United States in particular, in light of its extensive assistance to the government of Israel, should strongly urge Israel to end any measures that violate international humanitarian law and cause severe hardship to the Palestinian population.  In 1996, Human Rights Watch/Middle East issued a report on Israel's closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that discusses Israel's continuing obligations toward West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, including those living in areas under Palestinian self-rule. Human Rights Watch/Middle East has also repeatedly condemned suicide bombings against civilians inside Israel, most recently in a statement issued on July 30.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

In  Bosnia and Herzegovina: Politics of Revenge: The Misuse of Authority in Bihac, Cazin and Velika KladusaHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki charges that Alija Izetbegovic's Party of Democratic Action (SDA) systematically persecutes non-SDA members, particularly those who fought on the Bosnian-Serb side during the war.  """"The international community is obliged to become involved when the Dayton agreements are being flouted,"""" declared Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. """"Those who have abused their official positions to attack the political opposition should be held accountable. Any economic aid destined for the Una Sana canton should be conditioned on the end of these attacks on the opposition and compliance with both the Dayton agreement and international law."""" Human Rights Watch/Helsinki investigations in the canton reveal a pattern of severe abuses. Opposition groups have little or no access to the media and are severely restricted in their pre-election campaigning activities and in their access to participation in local politics. Local police commit frequent abuses, including the beating of individuals at the time of arrest and torture and ill-treatment during interrogation, with individuals frequently targeted for their political opinions.  Cantonal judicial authorities are currently holding ten individuals in the Luka Cantonal prison in Bihac on charges of war crimes. These arrests are in violation of the """"rules of the road"""" agreement signed in Rome by the parties to the Dayton Peace Accord. The """"rules of the road"""" require that local authorities obtain prior authorization from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) before arresting anyone suspected of having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. This authorization is designed specifically to avoid domestic prosecutions for war crimes that might be motivated by revenge and to ensure that the authorities possess sufficient evidence of individual guilt to warrant prosecution. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki offers an extremely detailed set of recommendations to improve the human rights situation in Una Sana canton. Among them: Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the Una Sana cantonal authorities, under Cantonal Governor Mirsad Veladzic, and including Bihac Mayor Adnan Alagic, Cazin Mayor Sabid Lipovic, and Velika Kladusa Mayor Ejup Alagic, to: inform all cantonal and municipal employees publicly and in writing that discrimination, harassment, and attacks against persons based upon their political affiliation will not be tolerated, and will result in punitive measures; end discrimination against non-SDA members in employment; dismiss any and all officials who participate in or officiate over harassment, intimidation, or attacks against persons based upon their political affiliation; cease immediately any and all direct and immediate incitement of acts of violence, discrimination or criminal harassment or intimidation against the opposition through television and radio; ensure that all political candidates and parties have equal access to the state-owned media in the Una Sana canton; provide security as necessary to ensure that the DNZ party members elected to the cantonal assembly can participate without fear of attack; immediately establish cooperative relationships with the federation ombudsmen's office, and with all international organizations involved in the implementation of the provisions of the Dayton agreement, according to their obligations under the Dayton agreement and under the federation constitution; grant equal access to humanitarian aid for all persons regardless of political affiliation. comply with the letter and spirit of the Rome Agreement by ensuring that all orders to arrest persons suspected of war crimes are based on evidence that has been determined to be sufficient by the ICTY. Specifically, the files of individuals whose names appear on any local lists of war crimes suspects, but who have not yet been arrested, should immediately be forwarded to the ICTY for review;Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the presidents of the local branches of the SDA, including cantonal SDA President Mirsad Veladzic , Biha SDA President Alaga Adinovic, Cazin SDA President Alaga Topic , and Velika Kladusa SDA President Ejup Alagic to: cease immediately any and all intimidation, discriminatory practices, harassment or ill-treatment of persons not affiliated with the SDA and/or members and candidates of opposition parties, and their families. Publicly direct the SDA membership to cease any such practices;Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the Una Sana cantonal judicial authorities, and specifically Hasan Pjanic, president of the cantonal court, to: drop war crimes charges against those whose files are determined by the ICTY to contain unsubstantiated or inadequate evidence of war crimes; ensure that those who appropriately remain in the custody of local cantonal authorities are guaranteed fair criminal justice procedures and protections. Specifically, immediately inform all suspects of their rights and the charges against them; allow immediate access to counsel of their choice; inform the suspects' families of their whereabouts within twenty-four hours of the detention, according to the provisions of domestic law; promptly bring detainees before a judge; subject each extension of detention to judicial review; ensure the right to trial within a reasonable time or release the defendant; guarantee public proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal; provide adequate and thorough medical care for prisoners; ensure that testimonies and confessions taken under duress or signed as a result of torture or other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials are not used in any court proceedings, except in proceedings against the perpetrators of the abuse.Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the Una Sana cantonal law enforcement officials, under the authority of cantonal Minister of the Interior Edhem Veladzic and Chief of Criminal Investigations Halid Velagic to: bring an immediate end to torture and ill-treatment of detainees by the police in Una Sana canton. institute and announce a policy that the beating and harassment of detainees is prohibited and that any officer suspected of violating the human rights of a detained person will be immediately suspended from duties, pending an investigation by IPTF and/or local police authorities; the officer will be permanently dismissed if found by either body to be responsible for abuse; institute disciplinary measures and criminal prosecution for any and all law enforcement personnel who are found to have been involved in beatings or other serious abuses of human rights; ensure that police take appropriate actions to stop attacks by others against persons based upon their political affiliation or ethnic origins, or based upon their employment with international organizations; void any statements or testimonies taken under duress or signed as a result of torture or other ill-treatment by law enforcement officials; ensure that conditions in the Luka Cantonal Prison continue to meet international standards of humane treatment, and that the rights of the detained are respected.

Human Rights Watch/Helsinki recommends that such a council include representatives from the federation and from the Republika Srpska. Independent organizations and individuals, including human rights or advocacy NGOs or groups should be permitted to submit evidence to the civilian implementation task force. protest at the highest levels all breaches of the """"rules of the road"""" and/or violations of international human rights standards; ensure that all proceedings in domestic war crimes cases are carefully monitored by qualified international staff with knowledge of human rights standards. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki commends those organizations-in particular the IPTF and the OSCE-that have monitored these cases, and encourages the continuation of such monitoring; press cantonal officials and federation authorities to remove officials determined to have participated in or ordered the commission of human rights abuses; use all political and diplomatic means possible to ensure the cooperation of the local authorities with the institution of the federation ombudsmen;Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the IPTF commissioner to: ensure that any and all law enforcement officers and officials found responsible for human rights abuses are expeditiously removed from the police force.

Allegations against these individuals are described in this report; order IPTF in Bihac to conduct regular inspections of the Ministry of the Interior/Criminal Investigations building and the area behind the building, especially any garage facility or similar structure which has been used as a place of detention and abuse, and monitor the activities of the criminal investigations unit and inspectors working out of the facility to ensure that no one is detained or mistreated in that facility; conduct a special investigation into police abuses in the Velika Kladusa and Cazin municipalities, and publicize the results; due to IPTF's major role in the screening and training of the local police in Bosnia and Hercegovina, IPTF monitors have a special duty to publicize police abuses as they occur. IPTF should publicize any and all human rights abuses at the hands of the police in a way that will protect the safety and privacy of victims. The IPTF should make public the names of the police officers when its investigation reveals evidence of police abuses, and call for their prosecution. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki urges the IPTF to fulfill its commitment that it will """"publish the names of the officers involved and will ensure that they no longer serve as policemen,"""" as stated by IPTF spokesperson Alexander Ivanko at a June 3, 1997 press conference in Sarajevo; publicize immediately any denial of access or obstruction of IPTF's mandate by local authorities; immediately end the ban on sharing information on human rights abuses with other organizations, except in cases where the sharing of information would jeopardize the safety of specific victims. Information regarding human rights abuses should not be withheld due to political considerations; resume the human rights training of the local police that had been taking place in the Una Sana canton until March 1997 by IPTF in collaboration with several international organizations, including UNHCR and the OSCE;Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the OSCE to:  urge the EASC to use its mandate in as broad a manner as possible to strike from the ballot any candidates for public office and political parties in the Una Sana canton, and throughout Bosnia and Hercegovina, who have violated the provisions of Annex III of the Dayton agreement and the Provisional Election Commission Rules, and to consider striking from the ballot candidates who have violated the provisions of the Dayton agreement other than Annex III. Among possible candidates whose names should be considered for striking from the ballot should be cantonal Governor Mirsad Veladzic, Bihac Mayor Adnan Alagic, Cazin Mayor Sabid Lipovic, Velika Kladusa Mayor and SDA President Ejup Alagic, Sanski Most Mayor Mehmed Alagic, Velika Kladusa Chief of Police Fikret Hadzic, Deputy Chief of Police Velika Kladusa Jasmin Aldiz, Cazin Chief of Police and SDA delegate to the cantonal assembly Cazim Budimlic, former SDA President of Cazin and Director of Cazin Hospital Selim Toromanovic, Director of Una Sana Cantonal Television and Radio Nedzib Veladzic, Director of Cantonal Criminal Investigations Halid Velagic, teacher Dzeko Bibujica, Cazin Minister of Education Jasmin Mureskic. Individuals who are struck from the ballot should be given the opportunity to have their cases heard in an independent review process in a manner which is in accordance with international legal standards; consider striking the SDA party from the ballot in the municipalities of Bihac, Cazin, and Velika Kladusa due to eighteen months of ongoing discrimination against non-members and systematic attacks against opposition members and their families; ensure that all political parties have equal access to media for the pre-election campaign period. If necessary, SFOR and IPTF should be requested to provide security through their presence for pre-election campaigning activities. The OSCE, IPTF, UNHCR, and SFOR should collaborate in monitoring and taking steps to prevent pre-election intimidation of voters; ensure that the EASC penalizes immediately any party member or party which engages in voter intimidation, as was done in other towns and municipalities, such as Prijedor, Banja Luka, Kotor Varos, and Gradisa for the upcoming municipal elections; develop a canton-specific plan, with the cooperation of SFOR and IPTF, for the protection and transition into office, of opposition members, DNZ or others, who may win in the municipal elections.Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to: expedite its review of all files submitted by the parties pursuant to their obligations under the Rome Agreement in order to facilitate the quickest possible arrest of individuals against whom the ICTY has found sufficient evidence;Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls upon the international community, and donor countries and organizations to: cease immediately any and all economic aid to SDA-controlled institutions-such as transportation, postal and telephone companies, businesses and factories, medical and educational facilities-that are shown to deny equal opportunity for employment and equal services to individuals based on political affiliation or ethnicity. Any such institution that changes its discriminatory policy should be rewarded with the aid which had been previously withheld; deny the award of small business loans or other international economic aid to individuals when they are determined to have participated in war crimes or human rights abuses; ensure that the OSCE is provided with sufficient funding to carry out its election monitoring role, including enabling all parties to participate equally in pre-election campaigning activities, and voter education. ensure that the EASC is provided with sufficient funding and resources necessary to perform its function. ensure that the ICTY has the financial resources and personnel necessary to review all files submitted to it pursuant to the Rome Agreement in an expeditious manner.","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/08/07/south-africa-medico-legal-system-fails-women-victims-violence","South Africa- Medico-Legal System Fails Women Victims of Violence","South Africa: Medico-Legal System Fails Women Victims of Violence","","08/07/1997","Women victims of rape or assault in South Africa face a criminal justice system that is too often unable or unwilling to assist them in their efforts to seek redress. In Violence against Women and the Medico-Legal System in South Africa, released to coincide with South African women's day, Human Rights Watch calls on the South African government to intensify its efforts to protect women from violence and to improve the state's response to such abuses, with particular attention to the medico-legal system. """"Despite recent efforts at reform, South Africa continues to fail its women,"""" charges Dorothy Q. Thomas, Director of the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project. """"Too often, the treatment they receive when they try to report rape or other abuse simply traumatizes them further, without offering them any hope of punishing their attackers."""" Of the 27,056 rapes reported in 1993, only 8,998 were prosecuted; of the cases brought to court, 4,753 resulted in convictions, just 17.5 percent of the total. Since 1993, the number of rapes reported has nearly doubled, to 50,481 in 1996; of these 21,863 were prosecuted, yet only 4,100 led to a conviction or 8.1 percent of the cases reported. While the percentage of cases prosecuted has increased, the rate of conviction has fallen. These worsening figures demand urgent attention. Women who wish to pursue a charge against their assailant are usually examined by a doctor, in most cases a state-employed district surgeon, and obtain a report of their injuries. Although no claim of rape is invalid for lack of such medical evidence, it often offers the only non-testimonial support of a woman's case and as such, can be crucial to its prosecution. Currently, in South Africa a handful of specialized medico-legal clinics offer a dedicated and technically excellent service. However, in most cases, the doctors who carry out the medical examination of a woman (or child) who has been raped have received no training in this part of their practice. Additional problems include the following: District surgeons often do not properly document medical evidence for use in court, and incomplete medical records for rape cases are commonplace. Medical legal services are often inaccessible, particularly to the black townships and in the rural areas. Given the time-sensitive nature of much medical evidence of sexual assault, and the trauma that accompanies such abuse, such delays can be devastating. District surgeons are frequently unsympathetic or even biased in their treatment of women who report abuse. District surgeons are poorly remunerated compared to doctors in private practice and working conditions are likely to be poor.Compounding these problems, police who are charged with referring and transporting women to district surgeons often fail to do so. This not only adds to already crippling potential delays, but given the inaccessibility of many medico-legal clinics and the costs of transportation to them, may effectively deny poor women in particular access to such services. Moreover,if a rape case actually reaches court, police and prosecutors are usually unable to evaluate or present medical evidence effectively to a court, and neither magistrates nor judges are likely to be able to make up for these deficiencies with their own training.  For the women involved, therefore, the price of reporting a sexual assault may be hours of travel and waiting for attention, unsympathetic treatment from police and medical personnel, and a negligible chance of seeing a known perpetrator convicted. Moreover, having finally been examined for such abuse,women must still go elsewhere for its treatment, as medical legal work usually does not include any treatment for the physical or psychological consequences of sexual assault.  The South African government has taken a number of steps to improve the response of the criminal justice system to violence against women. On August 9, the Department of Justice, which ran a campaign on violence against women between November 1996 and March 21, 1997, is scheduled to publish a major new set of guidelines for handling sexual assault cases, addressed to all professionals in the criminal justice system, including district surgeons. Health care is also undergoing radical reform, while the role of the health professionals, district surgeons in particular, in the human rights violations of the past has come under scrutiny from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human Rights Watch welcomes these developments and commends the government of South Africa for these and other key steps it is taking to improve the state response to violence against women. However, if the history of impunity for such abuse is to be more effectively curtailed, greater attention must be given to current flaws in the medico-legal system. We offer the following series of detailed recommendations for further improvement of the criminal justice system in this crucial area: General: Women who have been sexually assaulted and report to a police station should be taken by the police to be examined by a specialist medico-legal practitioner as soon as possible to ensure that forensic evidence is not lost. Following medico-legal examination, government policy should pay greater attention to the need for women to receive appropriate treatment for injuries, infections, or other related trauma.District surgeons/medico-legal practitioners: In reforming district surgeon services, attention should be paid to the urgent need to ensure adequate expertise in medico-legal matters among those doctors providing medico-legal services. Training programs should be developed for those appointed to carry out medico-legal work, both as a requirement before appointment and as annual in-service training. Manuals should be developed for newly appointed district surgeons (or district medical officers, as they are now to be known) which outline the relevant laws for their work, review the necessary specialized medical information (for example, ways of determining the time of injury), and provide detailed descriptions of injuries specific to sexual assault in both adult and child victims. Specialized curricula in clinical forensic medicine for medical students should be developed by the universities offering medical training and made compulsory for all medical students, with practical expertise in a medico-legal clinic a requirement of such courses; a qualification in clinical forensic medicine, similar to that for forensic pathologists, should also be developed and made available to those doctors who wish to specialize in this area of work.Police: Police investigating officers handling sexual assault and rape cases should specialize in such investigations and be trained in the issues surrounding violence against women and the use of medical and other forensic evidence.The courts: As is already the trend, each regional magistrates court should identify specialized prosecutors to handle cases of sexual abuse and rape who should receive additional training in the issues surrounding gender violence. Legislation should be introduced to abolish the use of the """"cautionary rule"""" in rape cases, which requires courts to exercise additional care in assessing the credibility of a rape survivor. The cautionary rule in rape cases places a particular mium on corroborative evidence if a woman is to win her case.The collection and analysis of medico-legal evidence: The form used by medico-legal doctors to document the medico-legal examination should be redesigned along the lines set out in the body of the report. The toria forensic biology laboratory, and forensic services in general, should be taken out of control of the police and placed under the Department of Health, with an independent status, similar for example to that of the attorneys general. Collection and dissemination of information on violence against women: All health facilities should have information on display and available to be taken away on the medico-legal and other services available to women who have been subjected to sexual assault or domestic violence. A national directory of governmental and nongovernmental services available to women should be developed, and information should be distributed to police stations and magistrates courts, as well as to district surgeons, hospitals and other health care facilities about locally available referral services for women who have been assaulted.","Africa, South Africa","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Annan United Nations New York, NY 10017 By Hand Dear Mr. Secretary-General, We are writing once again to express Human Rights Watch's deep concern about issues related to the investigation of alleged serious human rights violations in eastern Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In a letter addressed to the President of the Security Council on August 1, you informed the Council about your decision to appoint Atsu-Koffi Amega of Togo and Andrew R. Chigovera of Zimbabwe as, respectively, the Chairman and a member of the investigative team. As you no doubt recognize, the investigation must not only be impartial but must be seen to be impartial. In the case of Mr. Chigovera, Deputy Attorney-General of Zimbabwe, there exists a clear conflict of interest which, if not remedied, will cast doubt upon the independence and objectivity of the inquiry. We must therefore oppose the choice of Mr. Chigovera.  The Zimbabwean government, of which Mr. Chigovera remains a senior official, is a close ally of the DRC government. The Zimbabwean government openly defended the DRC in the face of international criticisms of its human rights record and reportedly even supplied it with arms during the recent conflict. As a civil servant of a government that has allied itself with the government under investigation, issued public pronouncements on the matters under investigation, and reportedly made itself complicit in the alleged atrocities at issue by supplying arms to the forces under scrutiny, Mr. Chigovera cannot meet high standards of impartiality and independence that such a serious investigation warrants. If he does not voluntarily disqualify himself from the mission in light of these revelations regarding his government's official positions, we assume that you would withdraw his mandate. In addition, because of the enormity of the task at hand, we believe it would be advisable to expand the number of team members to five to assure that the investigation proceeds thoroughly in all the regions where abuses are alleged to have occurred. We are sure that you recognize the importance of naming persons whose experience and integrity are such as to ensure that the results of their research will be found credible by the entire international community. The staff that will support the team in the field must also be comprised of human rights professionals with extensive experience investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity. Given the principle of transparency that you have so often affirmed, we trust that you will soon be making public the mandate under which the team will be functioning. Such publication is essential to provide guidance and support to the team should it encounter any new obstacles posed by the DRC government. It will also enable the international community to clearly assess the DRC government's cooperation with the investigation and to evaluate the success of the team in fulfilling the mandate assigned. The mandate should include explicit authority to:  investigate alleged atrocities, including reported massacres, at the following sites that have been identified by our own research and that of other reliable international and nongovernmental organizations: Amisi, Biaro, Inera, Kahundo, Kasese, Katale, Kibumba, Lula, Masisi, Mbandaka (W. Congo), Mpanzi, Mugunga, Sake, Shabunda, Tingi-Tingi, approaching Tongo, Walikale, Wenji (W. Congo), as well as camps near Bukavu, Goma, and Kisangani. establish the identity of the military units and their commanding officers responsible for operations in and around the sites of alleged abuses. determine whether the creation of an international tribunal is warranted. work closely with other relevant agencies of the U.N., including those created by the Commission on Human Rights.  issue and make public periodic progress reports at specified intervals and a final report. maintain full-time investigators in the region for as long as necessary to fulfill the mandate. Given the great seriousness of the investigation to be undertaken, Human Rights Watch has high expectations that you will complete the nominations to the investigative team and publish its mandate promptly. We attach extraordinary importance to this investigation and will monitor its progress closely. Thank you for your kind attention.

In presenting Belarus: Crushing Civil Society today at a press conference in Minsk, Jonathan Fanton, chair of the Human Rights Watch/Helsinki advisory committee is calling on the Belarusian government to cease its relentless attacks on free expression and association. The 52-page report documents government assaults on civil society, that target primarily the media and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). After banning all public discussion from the state-owned media, the government is now driving all independent media outlets out of business. Throughout the last few years, it has closed two independent radios and a television station . It has marginalized the independent print media by misusing its monopoly on publishing houses and issuing arbitrary tax regulations.  As part of the effort to curtail media freedoms, journalists, especially television reporters, have been attacked while covering demonstrations. The report notes that the campaign against the Russian broadcast media is especially fierce because Russian television dares to criticize Belarusian government policy and offers the only television news alternative to the closely-controlled Belarusian news. The arrest of ORT journalist Pavel Sheremet, together with two colleagues, Dmitry Zavadsy and Yaroslav Ovchinnikov, on July 26 on charges of """"border violations"""" is merely the latest case in a clear pattern of governement harassment of journlaists. Sheremet had been filming at the Belarusian border, allegedly in violation of article 80 of the Belarusian criminal code. Given the harassment of journalists generally in Belarus, and the targetting of Sheremet in particular (his accreditation had been revoked earlier this month), Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes the government is using article 80 as a pretext to silence Sheremet and to send a signal to like-minded journalists. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki therefore views the arrest of Sheremet and his crew as politically motivated and calls for their immediate and unconditional release. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki also details the harassment of NGOs through questionable tax audits and outrageous rent hikes for those NGOs housed in government-owned buildings. For example, as a result of an apparently politically motivated campaign against the Children of Chernobyl - a humanitarian organization which provides aid to victims of the Chernobyl disaster - the organization has had to stop its humanitarian support program to kindergartens, orphanages and the physically handicapped. In late April 1997, the Belarusian government imposed a $3 million fine on the Belarusian Soros Foundation, after which the Foundation-which had invested $13 million into educational projects and the development of the civil society in Belarus-suspended its activities in the country. According to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, """"this can be only interpreted as an attempt to force the foundation to close its office in Minsk and deprive numerous NGOs of their main source of financial support."""" A presidential decree of March 5, 1997, limits yet another outlet for free expression: peaceful mass demonstrations. The decree seriously compromises the staging of demonstrations, and establishes numerous vaguely worded rules and obligations for participants and organizers, which can be used to arbitrarily restrict freedom of assembly. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki condemns the exorbitant fines on demonstrators and organizers levied recently after blatantly unfair trials. Excessive use of force by police to break up peaceful demonstrations is designed to spread terror among protestors and bystanders, rather than an attempt to maintain or restore public order. In response to severe criticism from a variety of international organizations and governments, the Belarusian government wrote to the European Union (EU) in April 1997 promising to restore democracy and respect for human rights, and agreed to start a dialogue with the opposition on constitutional change, under the auspices of the EU and other international organizations. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki asserts that to date, these are empty promises. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the Belarusian government to:   Reestablish the independence of the judiciary to ensure effective judicial protection of human rights and freedoms -in accordance with international standards- against decisions and actions of the executive and legislative powers; Immediately end measures aimed at establishing a complete state monopoly on information. In particular, cease using the state monopoly on print and distribution services to marginalize the independent media. Also, Decree No. 218 on the import and export of information should be rescinded and its provisions removed from the draft law on the mass media. Similarly, the draft law should set out an appeals process for journalists whose accreditation has been revoked.  In addition, Ministry of Communications plans to restrict the use of private telephones should be halted; confiscations of written, taped and video materials should be ceased; and independent journalists should be granted sufficient access to government information; Cease all forms of government- initiated or supported harassment of independent media and individual journalists. In particular, cease politically motivated rent hikes; physical and verbal attacks on journalists; and end restrictions on the use of publishing houses;  Immediately release Pavel Sheremet, Dmitry Zavadsy and Yaroslav Ovchinnikov; Restore the accreditation of television journalists Pavel Sheremet and Aleksandr Stupnikov, as well the latter's residence permit; Reestablish Radio 2, Radio 101.2, and independent Belarusian television stations; Cease performing politically motivated audits of NGOs and discontinue other forms of harassment of NGOs, such as raising their rents unreasonably or forcing them to move out of their offices; Establish sufficient guarantees to exclude political criteria from playing a role in the admission and dismissal of lawyers from bar associations; Rescind the arbitrary provisions in Presidential Decree No. 5 restricting public demonstrations; Ensure that demonstrations can be organized and carried out in accordance with international law and human rights standards, and without unnecessary police intervention; Ensure that in cases of police interventions law enforcement agencies employ only those measures that are strictly needed to restore public order and that police do not arbitrarily arrest or beat demonstration participants and non-participants; and Cease the harassment and intimidation of deputies of the 13th Supreme Soviet and political opponents of the government, including at work places, universities and schools.Human Rights Watch calls on the Russian government to:  Encourage the Belarusian government to implement the above recommendations, using its good offices and its exceptional relationship with Belarus; Following references to human rights and press freedoms in the Belarus-Russia union treaty, to continuously seek guarantees from the Belarusian authorities for respect for human rights; Within the context of the Belarus-Russia union treaty, establish an independent human rights commission to investigate violations of human rights in Belarus; Support the European Union, the OSCE and the Council of Europe in their efforts to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus. Human Rights Watch calls on the European Union and the Council of Europe to: Increase support and assistance for civil society in Belarus, especially by encouraging the organization of seminars on human rights and the rule of law for NGOs, judges, lawyers and law enforcement officers; and by organizing seminars to promote media freedoms and discourage censorship that would include government officials, representatives of both the state-owned and independent media, and human rights NGOs.","Europe/Central Asia, Belarus",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/07/29/condition-china-summit-human-rights","Condition China Summit on Human Rights","Condition China Summit on Human Rights","","07/29/1997","(New York) - The Clinton Administration should avoid setting a firm date for a summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China until Beijing takes significant, concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights performance, Human Rights Watch/Asia said today. """"The Administration would no doubt welcome some token prisoner releases or other gestures as window dressing, but the White House is unwilling to say that without real human rights progress, there will be no summit,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. """"The Administration risks throwing away the enormous leverage of a summit meeting, rather than using it to get something meaningful in return on human rights. High level exchanges can be useful, but Clinton shouldn't give away a photo op in the Oval Office for free."""" He pointed out that Vice President Al Gore's visit to Beijing last March produced no progress on human rights; a summit meeting is even more important to Beijing, given the prestige and propaganda value attached, and the Administration should make a summit clearly conditional on human rights progress. Human Rights Watch responded strongly to reports from Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, where U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed the summit with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, over the weekend; U.S. spokespeople said that October 28 was the probable date for the meeting. Meanwhile, a working level visit to Beijing by U.S. officials has just concluded, seeking to lay the groundwork for the summit. A crucial congress of the Chinese Communist Party is also due to take place in October; a summit meeting in the U.S. would be viewed as a crowning achievement by Jiang Zemin.  The Clinton Administration, meanwhile, is under pressure to show that its policy of """"constructive engagement"""" can yield results. At their meeting in Manila last November, President Clinton and President Jiang agreed in principle to reciprocal visits, but U.S. officials at that time avoided setting a date until after the reversion of Hong Kong on July 1. Now that the handover is past, the momentum towards a summit seems to be increasing, leading to a visit to China by Clinton sometime next year. """"Resuming a formal dialogue on human rights, or releasing a few dissidents is simply not sufficient,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"There should be no Oval Office meeting until Beijing takes significant steps, such as allowing access to Tibet and Xinjiang by human rights monitors, repealing or amending state security laws, providing access to Chinese detention facilities by international humanitarian agencies, signing and ratifying without reservations two U.N. human rights conventions (the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), releasing large numbers of Chinese and Tibetan political and religious prisoners, and protecting basic civil liberties in Hong Kong."""" The organization also warned that the U.S. might be tempted at a summit meeting to bargain away a resolution at next year's United Nation's Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, and urged the U.S., the European Union, Japan and other governments not to abandon action on China at the highest U.N. body responsible for monitoring compliance with international human rights standards.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

""""Whether it's the disastrous effect on investment and development of executions and mass arrests in Cambodia, or the continuing outflow of refugees sparked by gross abuses in Burma, ASEAN has an inherent self-interest in becoming more pro-active on behalf of human rights,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the organization's Washington Director. """"Its role in Cambodia has certainly been highly useful and constructive, and we hope that ASEAN will also become more active on Burma."""" ASEAN is expected to formally admit Burma as a member of the association at its ministerial meeting on July 24-25; Cambodia's ASEAN membership has been delayed, though the current foreign minister, Ung Huot, is due to attend as an observer.   Human Rights Watch/Asia released a report, Burma/Thailand: No Safety in Burma, No Sanctuary in Thailand, as the ASEAN meetings were underway, charging that human rights abuses committed by the Burmese military government continue to force thousands of refugees into neighboring countries. These abuses, which include killings, torture, forced labor and forced relocations, have continued even in areas where cease-fire agreements with rebel armies have been signed. Thailand- a leading member of ASEAN- has borne the main burden of new refugees in the past year. The report also documents violations of international legal norms by the Royal Thai government, which has forcibly repatriated back to Burma more than 8,500 refugees who fled a military offensive against the Karen National Union in February, 1997. Thai authorities also refused entry to an estimated 60,000 refugees from the Shan State from March 1996 onwards. The refugees were fleeing forced relocations and other abuses by the Burmese army affecting an estimated 100,000 people. The report was based on first-hand interviews conducted on the Thai-Burmese border in June 1997, and other documentation.   As the major refugee-producing country in the region, the Burmese government has been denounced in successive United Nations resolutions, yet ASEAN has largely remained silent. """"We hope that ASEAN, having admitted Burma as a member, will establish a working group to promote a peaceful end to violence and to curb repression, pressing for implementation of the U.N.'s recommendations,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk. """"It is urgent that the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Burma, Justice Rajsoomer Lallah, be given access to Burma -- including ethnic minority areas -- before the next ASEAN meeting in Malaysia in December 1997."""" Human Rights Watch/Asia also called on the Thai authorities to take steps to prevent the forcible repatriation of refugees and to allow the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to carry out its mandate on the Thai/Burmese border, and urged the broader international community to step up concerted pressure on Rangoon to respect basic human rights, including through economic measures.   In Cambodia, since Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's July 5-6 coup, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has carried out a sustained campaign of violence and intimidation aimed at rooting out the political opposition. There have been between thirty and forty deaths in detention, including six confirmed assassinations of high-ranking officials from the FUNCINPEC party of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The government has detained hundreds of soldiers from army units commanded by pro-FUNCINPEC officers, and by its own admission, subjected them to a program of """"reeducation."""" At least thirty of these soldiers, detained at a former FUNCINPEC base at Thaing Kasing, have been tortured while in custody. FUNCINPEC's entire organizational structure has been shattered, with offices throughout the country looted and destroyed and up to 200 local or provincial officials placed in detention. Door-to-door searches for FUNCINPEC members continue, on the pretext of uncovering """"illegal weapons."""" Although Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has promised to hold free and fair elections for Cambodia's parliament next year, there is little reason to feel confident this commitment will be fulfilled when scores of opposition parliamentarians, journalists, and human rights activists- whose presence is crucial to ensuring free elections take place- have gone into hiding or fled across the border to Thailand.   Human Rights Watch/Asia called on the member countries of ASEAN to: 1) continue to delay Cambodia's ASEAN membership pending an end to killings, arrests and harassment of opposition politicians and supporters, the release of all those in custody, and steps by the Royal Cambodian Government to hold accountable those responsible for abuses that have occurred during and since the coup; 2) continue to withhold investment in Cambodia until basic human rights and conditions for internationally supervised, free and fair elections are restored and elections are underway; 3) ensure the provision of humanitarian parole to refugees fleeing political persecution in Cambodia and facilitate the safe passage of refugees to destinations outside the region.   Other governments attending the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference, including the United States, Australia, Canada, and Japan, should closely coordinate their policies with ASEAN and announce in Kuala Lumpur that they will suspend all bilateral and multilateral aid to the Cambodian government pending compliance with the measures outlined above, while providing direct assistance to non-governmental organizations, private development and human rights groups; instruct their embassies in Cambodia to provide shelter and, on a case-by-case basis, visas for victims of political persecution; expand budgetary support for the Phnom Penh field office of the U.N.

Human Rights Watch is highly critical of the refusal of the United States government to speak out publicly about abusive practices in Bahrain, a major naval port for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.  """"Washington's silence in the face of flagrant human rights violations by its Persian Gulf allies is inevitably read as tacit acceptance,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The absence of any public reproach to Bahrain for its shameful policies stands in disappointing contrast to the Clinton administration's lofty pronouncements about human rights and democracy in general."""" The 109-page report, based on interviews with Bahraini residents, including lawyers and prominent businesspeople, and with persons whom the government has forcibly exiled, also analyzes Bahrain's laws and legal practice. """"We found two basic categories of violations,"""" says Joe Stork, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch/Middle East. """"The first, relating to law enforcement and administration of justice, includes arbitrary detention, physical abuse of detainees, and special security courts that deny elementary due process rights. The second category covers basic political rights such as the freedom to speak out and to hold meetings, form political parties and criticize government policies. Bahrainis risk arrest and physical abuse, and even exile, for demanding that the government abide by the 1973 constitution."""" Bahrain's constitution guarantees many of these rights and freedoms, and provides for a partially-elected National Assembly, but the ruling family, headed by Amir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa and his brother, Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, unilaterally dissolved the National Assembly in August 1975. In 1976, the government decreed a new penal code that substantively nullified many of the civil liberties and political rights protected by the constitution and criminalized a wide range of non-violent political activities. Abuses such as torture, which are categorically outlawed by the constitution as well as international law, are common and go unpunished. Uncorroborated confessions, secured in the absence of legal counsel, are sufficient for security court convictions, which cannot be appealed. Arbitrary detention and forced exile are practiced as matters of state policy.  Human Rights Watch concludes that the contention of the government of Bahrain, that the unrest of the past two-and-a-half years can be wholly ascribed to Iranian-sponsored """"terrorism,"""" lacks credibility. Human Rights Watch urges the government of Bahrain to amend the 1974 State Security Measures Law, the 1976 Penal Code, and all other laws and decrees to eliminate or modify provisions that violate Bahrain's constitution and that unduly restrict the ability of Bahraini citizens to exercise peacefully their rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression. Stressing the need to end the practice of forcibly exiling Bahraini citizens, Human Rights Watch recommends that the government annouce that all Bahrainis living in exile are free to return, and that those individuals whom the authorities believe to be responsible for a crime be formally charged and tried before a court of law operating in accordance with international fair trial standards. The report also recommends that the government appoint a special public prosecutor, without ties to the Ministry of Interior, to investigate and publicly report on deaths and alleged acts of torture at the hands of security forces, and to bring charges against any officials implicated in such acts. Finally, Human Rights Watch urges the government to grant visas to independent human rights monitors to conduct research and to attend trials inside Bahrain. Human Rights Watch strongly urges the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to use their close and longstanding military and political ties with Bahrain to press the ruling Al Khalifa family publicly to end abusive practices that are recurrent, systematic, and matters of state policy, and to take steps that will make clear to the government of Bahrain that persistent human rights violations will affect negatively the depth and quality of overall relations, including military and security relations. The group also urges the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to put Bahrain's human rights record on the agendas of hearings dealing with U.S. policies in the Middle East.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Bahrain",""

The arrests represent an important step in the campaign to bring to justice those most responsible for the slaughter of more than half a million Rwandan Tutsi. Together with the earlier arrest of Col. Theoneste Bagosora, these detentions mark the first time that international justice has succeeded in indicting and arresting such high-level leaders for massive crimes against humanity.   The arrests were made in Nairobi, where many of those accused of genocide had long found shelter. Although Kenyan authorities had previously assisted in one arrest for the International Tribunal, they had never before helped arrest persons accused of playing such a leading role in the genocide. The two international human rights organizations hailed this kind of cooperation as essential for ending impunity for massive human rights abuses in Africa. Both Zambia and Cameroon have also arrested persons sought by the International Tribunal. Those arrested in Kenya included the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, who directed the government during the genocide and who allegedly helped rally tens of thousands of members of his MDR (Democratic Republican Movement) party to support the killing, and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, then Minister of Family and Womenµs Affairs, who reportedly ordered killings in her home prefecture of Butare. Nyiramasuhukoµs son, Anselme Shalom Ntahobali, is accused of having led the Interahamwe militia in slaughtering Tutsi in Butare. The Tribunal has arrested two important military figures, Colonel Gratien Kabiligi and Major Aloys Ntabakuze, thus recognizing that soldiers under their command apparently massacred Tutsi and directed Hutu civilians in carrying out the slaughter. The Tribunal has also detained the former governor of Butare, Sylvain Nsabimana, and Hassan Ngeze, who ran the newspaper Kangura-source of some of the most virulent propaganda against Tutsi. Five of those arrested are provisionally detained; Nyiramasuhuko and her son have been indicted. Human Rights Watch and FIDH urge that the international community provide the human resources necessary for rapid completion of investigations and prosecutions in these cases. They note that the lack of investigators and experienced prosecutors has slowed the work of the Tribunal in the past and call upon the Secretary-General Kofi Annan to make the recruitment of capable persons for these posts a priority.

""""Soviet-style restrictions on what can be broadcast or published are so tight that news reporting is reduced to empty propaganda, and even important economic data is withheld from the public,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. """"This is in an environment where media consumers have decreasing access to Russian Federation newspapers and television as the Uzbekistan authorities seek to reduce political criticism from outside.""""  The report contrasts Uzbekistan government promises of improved legal protections for journalists with reality, where newspapers, television and radio come under close scrutiny for their political content and are forced to adopt a uniformly loyal, uncritical line. Newspapers that breach these rules may be closed, and individuals who do so are fired or otherwise victimized. In one case, the editor of the Hurriyat newspaper was forced out of his job earlier this year after refusing to submit to government censorship. The opposition is not afforded any right to air its views or reply to virulent official attacks on it in the overwhelmingly state-owned media.  Apart from the international conventions on free expression to which it has become a party, Uzbekistan recently introduced legislation of its own setting out rights to obtain information and to practice journalism. """"For the moment there's little hope that these moves represent anything more than window dressing,"""" says Ms. Cartner. """"Few journalists will dare claim their rights while working within such a repressive media environment."""" Past experience shows that the law is little respected in practice: for instance, the 1992 Constitution bans censorship, yet all national newspapers are scrutinized by a censor's office paid for and supervised by the government.  International donors have been slow to publicly criticize human rights abuses and specifically suppression of free speech in Uzbekistan. The result has been that the authorities gain approval by hosting internationally-sponsored seminars on the media while continuing to commit gross abuses with impunity.

For the past two years, Dr. Soroush, an internationally reknowned philosopher and a leading proponent of religious reform in Iran, has been the subject of physical attacks by Hezbollahi mobs, with the apparent acquiescence of government authorities. Instead of coming to his aid, government authorities themselves have threatened him, censored his speech, and have now confiscated his passport.  In May 1995, Dr. Soroush was attacked by Hezbollahi mobs as he gave a lecture, prompting more than one hundred of his academic colleagues to sign an open letter in July 1995 calling on Your Excellency to uphold the Iranian constitution by taking affirmative steps to prevent such threats to the free exchange of ideas. As the attacks continued in the following months, however, government security personnel repeatedly refused to intervene to protect Dr. Soroush, rendering it all but impossible for him to continue to teach or give public lectures. Dr. Soroush subsequently received harassing phone calls and threats from officials at the Ministry of Information who warned him not to write or speak on matters pertaining to the government or clergy. In May 1996, unable to pursue a livelihood and unprotected from continuing mob attacks, Dr. Soroush left Iran fearing for his safety. In an open letter to Your Excellency, dated May 9, 1996, Dr. Soroush called on the government for protection of the right of academics and students to engage in open intellectual discussion. Shortly after returning to Iran in April 1997, Dr. Soroush, still unable to resume his teaching duties, reportedly was dismissed from his remaining post at a research institute. Although he has since been allowed on occasion to make public speeches, such as a lecture in Tehran in June of this year reportedly attended by over 3,000 people, his passport has been confiscated by officials at the Ministry of Information. As a result, Dr. Soroush has been prevented from attending academic seminars to which he was invited in Germany, Malaysia, and, most recently, England, where the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies had invited him to give a plenary address at a conference held July 6-9, 1997.  In an open letter to Your Excellency, dated July 6, 1997, Dr. Soroush recounts these unfortunate events as well as a recent incident in which an official at the Ministry of Information threatened that he would not be able to resume teaching and could face imprisonment if he did not stop calling for systematic reform of government in the Islamic Republic.  As academic leaders, scientists and scholars dedicated to human rights, we deplore the continuing arbitrary restrictions on Dr. Soroush's freedom to pursue his academic work. These restrictions violate fundamental provisions of the the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Iran on June 24, 1975, including the right to leave his country, guaranteed by article 12, and the right to freedom of opinion and expression, guaranteed by article 19. Violation of these freedoms has direct and deleterious effects on scholarship and academic freedom. Members of the academic community cannot fulfill their paramount role in fostering free inquiry, rational discourse and open exchange of ideas where they must live in fear that, if they express their views, they will be subjected to intimidation and deprivation of basic rights. We respectfully urge you to use your good offices to ensure that all harassment of Dr. Soroush cease and that his right to teach and right to travel freely be restored immediately. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. We look forward to your reply.

Drawing on a never-before-publicized fifteen volume set of U.S. Army documents on landmine warfare, the two organizations released a new report, In its Own Words, that seriously undermines the Pentagon's current contention that any landmine ban must have exceptions for Korea and for so-called smart mines. The U.S. is in the midst of an internal review of its landmines policy aimed at deciding whether or not to join the diplomatic initiative known as the Ottawa Process, with negotiations on a comprehensive ban treaty in Oslo in September and the treaty signing in Ottawa in December. Among the more than 100 nations already committed are key NATO allies such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, as well as many of the nations where mines have been used the most extensively, such as Angola and Bosnia. The Army documents recently obtained by the Human Rights Watch Arms Project reveal that dissent within the U.S. military about the utility of antipersonnel mines dates back to at least the Korean War. The documents, prepared in 1972, include U.S. casualty statistics, unit records, monthly action reports, field manuals and operational plans for the Korean and Vietnam wars. """"After the release of In its Own Words there should be no foundation left for those who want to argue that we should fight to hold on to such weapons,"""" retired Lieutenant General James Hollingsworth declared. Hollingsworth, who commanded U.S. forces in South Korea from 1973 to 1976, renewed his call first made with fourteen other retired U.S. military commanders in April 1996 for President Clinton to ban the use, manufacture, stockpiling and export of antipersonnel mines. Others echoing the call for a ban include retired generals Henry Emerson, Robert Gard, Douglas Kinnard, and David Palmer.  Pentagon and Clinton Administration officials have consistently said that antipersonnel mines save the lives of U.S. troops and are essential to the defense of South Korea. But the Army's own archival material and the assessments of numerous former military commanders published in In Its Own Words seriously call into question these two assumptions. The report reveals that: One-third of all U.S. Army casualties in Vietnam were caused by mines. More U.S. Army mine casualties in Korea were caused by U.S. defensive minefields than by the enemy's mines. The main source of landmines for the enemy in both Korea and Vietnam was captured U.S. mines and mine components.  By 1969, ninety percent of all component parts in mines used against U.S. troops in Vietnam were U.S.-made.  In Vietnam, the enemy lifted 10,000 of 30,000 U.S. antipersonnel mines in one minefield.  In Korea, 100,000 U.S. mines out of a shipment of 120,000 were lost to the enemy. It was the U.S., and not North Korea or North Vietnam, which introduced mines en masse into Korea and Vietnam and the U.S. lost control of the weapon shortly thereafter. U.S. minefields were easily breached during the Korean War, sending U.S. troops retreating through their own unmarked minefields. I have always been convinced that landmines caused more harm than good in Korea,"""" charged retired Lieutenant General Henry (Hank) Emerson, recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross (two occasions), five Silver Stars and two Purple Hearts. """"I know a significant number of the landmines we encountered in Vietnam were of U.S. origin. They are a horrible weapon and they caused a very high proportion of our casualties in Vietnam."""" In fact the first U.S. soldier to die in Vietnam perished in an antipersonnel mine blast.  [This report] should be required reading for any official, in or out of the military, who might have anything to do with shaping American policy on this crucial matter,"""" said retired Lieutenant General David R. Palmer, President, Walden University. """"I never saw a situation where I thought the use of antipersonnel landmines would be wise militarily for American forces; nor can I envision one in theory."""" In Its Own Words provides powerful reinforcement to the compelling case to ban antipersonnel landmines-not only for humanitarian reasons, but also to serve the best interests of the military forces of the United States,"""" said retired Lt. General Robert Gard, President, Monterey Institute of International Studies.  Human Rights Watch and the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation urge the Clinton Administration to drop its insistence that any ban on antipersonnel mines must include exceptions for the use of both long-lasting """"dumb"""" mines and self-destructing """"smart"""" mines on the Korean peninsula, and for the use of """"smart"""" mines everywhere else. The U.S. military's own archival resources presented in this report indicate that antipersonnel mines do not play an essential role in defending Korea or protecting the lives of U.S. soldiers.  Human Rights Watch and VVAF also call on the Clinton Administration to declare its support for the Ottawa Treaty process, to participate in the treaty negotiations in Oslo in September, and to go to Ottawa in December 1997 to sign an international mine ban treaty without exceptions. The U.S. should also undertake immediately unilateral steps toward a ban, including renunciation of the production of antipersonnel mines, and the development of a timetable for the destruction of both """"dumb"""" and """"smart"""" mines, as opposed to current policy which only calls for destruction of three-fourths of its four million """"dumb"""" mines and none of its ten million """"smart"""" mines.

In a letter sent today to Algeria's Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adami, Human Rights Watch expressed its distress at Mr. Mesli's conviction by the criminal court of Tizi Ouzou on the charge of """"encouraging"""" and """"providing apologetics"""" for """"terrorism"""" that was introduced at the end of his trial, after he was acquitted of all original charges levelled against him. No evidence to support the new charge was produced and the defense had no opportunity to contest it. A copy of the letter is attached.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- July 18, 1997 Mr. Mohamed Adami Minister of Justice Ministry of Justice 8 Place Bir Hakim, El-Biar Algiers, Algeria via post and facsimile Dear Mr Adami: Human Rights Watch is distressed to learn that Rachid Mesli, an Algiers lawyer active in the field of human rights, was convicted and sentenced on July 16 to three years in prison after spending almost twelve months in detention. Mr. Mesli was convicted on charges of """"encouraging"""" and """"providing apologetics"""" for """"terrorism."""" This charge, according to his defense lawyers, was introduced only at the very end of the trial, after Mr. Mesli had been acquitted of all original charges brought against him. No evidence to support the new charge was produced and the defense had no opportunity to contest it.  Human Rights Watch urges that, in light of these evident irregularities, Mr. Mesli be released immediately and unconditionally.  In addition to the improper introduction of new charges at the end of the trial, we are concerned that Mr. Mesli may have been prosecuted at least in part because of his work in defense of human rights. According to information we have received, Mr. Mesli's initial interrogation began with questions regarding his contacts with the international human rights organization Amnesty International. This contact was also mentioned in his court file, and was a subject of questioning by the trial judge. We also note that the government of Algeria denied visas to persons designated by Amnesty International to observe the trial, and discouraged other foreign lawyers from attending. Nor was Mr. Mesli's family permitted to attend the trial. Furthermore, the court's judgment made no pronouncement on the formal complaints lodged by the defense concerning Mr. Mesli's illegal, abduction-like arrest on July 31, 1996 by plainclothesmen who presented no warrant, his subsequent """"disappearance"""" until August 10, or the physical mistreatment he apparently endured during interrogation. By failing to respond to these complaints, the court has reinforced the impunity that prevails regarding abuses committed by the security forces against persons in their custody.  Human Rights Watch wrote to Algerian authorities on August 2, 1996 concerning Mr. Mesli's arrest but never received a reply. On July 31, 1996, Mr. Mesli was stopped in the Rouiba area outside Algiers by four armed men in civilian clothes who took him away in a car. All inquiries to the authorities by his family, lawyers, and international human rights organizations as to his whereabouts went unanswered. He was finally brought before an examining magistrate on August 10, charged with complicity with an armed group, and transferred to el-Harrache prison in Algiers. A day later, the Observatoire nationale des droits de l'homme confirmed to Amnesty International that Mr. Mesli had been held with judicial authorization prior to his appearance, but did not explain why the security forces had refused to acknowledge his detention. Lawyers who saw Mr. Mesli at his first court appearances in August 1996 noted that he had bruises on his right eye and his hand, and seemed to be in poor health. He subsequently filed a complaint alleging that he had been subjected to violence while in custody. A medical report filed by a doctor who examined him during his detention was reportedly read out, without comment, by the presiding judge at Mr. Mesli's trial. It also noted bruises to his face and injuries to his arms.  According to our information, Mr. Mesli's trial this week lasted two days, July 15 and 16, in the criminal court in Tizi Ouzou. During the trial, he was questioned by the court on the charges appearing on his charge sheet: involvement in an armed group whose purpose is to spread killings and terror, and providing information to an armed group, based on Articles 87bis(3) and 86 respectively of the penal code. Mr. Mesli claimed in his defense that his contacts with members of armed groups were strictly in his capacity as a lawyer advising them on the possibility of surrendering to the authorities under a policy of reduced punishments for those who do so voluntarily (the law of rahma). The tribunal, after deliberating, acquitted him of these two charges but then convicted him under Article 87(bis)4, an excessively broad article that provides sentences of up to ten years for """"anyone who makes apologetics for, encourages or finances, by any means whatsoever, acts of [terrorism or subversion].""""  This was despite the fact that Mr. Mesli had not been brought to trial on this charge. The court provided no evidence to support this charge, and did not allow any opportunity for Mr. Mesli or his lawyers to contest it. The court instead immediately proceeded to declare him guilty of this charge, and handed down a sentence of three years. Mr. Mesli's defense lawyers have declared their intent to appeal the conviction on procedural grounds, arguing that under Algeria's code of penal procedure, a court cannot rule on a charge that was not the subject of argument by the prosecution and the defense (Articles 305 and 306).  In our view, Mr. Mesli has been subjected to a series of human rights violations from the time of his arrest through his being sentenced this week to prison in a grossly unfair trial that was closed to observers and family and in which he was questioned explicitly about his work in defense of human rights. We therefore strongly urge that he be released immediately and unconditionally.  We thank you for your consideration and welcome your comments.

According to Human Rights Watch, police raids on Kenyan campuses last week, part of a wider government crackdown on opposition groups, resulted in running battles between students and police that left numerous students wounded, as many as four students dead, though reports are still unconfirmed, and led to the closure of Kenyatta and Nairobi Universities, two of Kenya's five public universities.    Human Rights Watch believes that the root of the recent violence, and of the series of clashes between students and police that have plagued Kenya's campuses in recent months, is government refusal to respect the autonomy of campuses and students' basic civil and political rights. Human Rights Watch researcher Joseph Saunders, who specializes in academic freedom and university issues, emphasized that """"the Kenyan government has an obligation to respect the right of students to express their views on matters of public concern and to form or join associations to promote their common interests, and an obligation to ensure that police comply with international standards on the use of force and firearms against unarmed protesters."""" While acknowledging that angry students themselves have resorted to stone-throwing and destruction of property, Mr. Saunders emphasized that such regrettable incidents in most cases directly followed unwarranted police assaults on peaceful campus assemblies, and in any case did not justify the use of live ammunition against the protesters. The letter also calls on the government to pursue full investigations of the recent deaths and of four additional student deaths, at least three at the hands of police, that have marred Kenya's campuses in the past year.    A copy of the letter to President Moi follows.     July 17, 1997    His Excellency Daniel arap Moi  Office of the President  P.O. Box 30510  Nairobi, Kenya    Dear President Moi:    We write this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to express our grave concern over the continuing crisis at Kenya's universities.    On July 9, 1997, Kenyatta University and all four campuses of Nairobi University were closed indefinitely following students protests over the government's violent crackdown on opposition groups seeking constitutional reform. These groups, supported by many students and student organizations, had scheduled a national day of protest for July 7, the anniversary of the government's violent suppression seven years earlier of groups seeking a multiparty political system for Kenya. The government greeted the protests on July 7 with armed force. Among the targets of the crackdown were student leaders and student groups who supported the national day of protest, as well as students who had participated in rallies and clashes with police in preceding days over proposed national legislation facilitating the expulsion of university students with tuition arrears.    Eyewitnesses report that on the morning of July 7 police raided the campuses of Kenyatta and Nairobi Universities, tracking down tens of students and attacking them in dormitory rooms and classrooms where year-end exams were being held. Numerous students, several bystanders, and at least one professor were hospitalized, some with gunshot wounds. On July 8, unconfirmed reports stated that four students were among the ten or more individuals killed in the government crackdown the previous day. In response to these reports, students then began reassembling to mourn the deaths of their colleagues and to plan processions and new rallies. These campus assemblies were again violently disrupted by the police, leading to a series of running battles between police and students. The campus closures followed on July 9. Recent reports suggest that similar violence has spread to other campuses, including that of the Kenya Polytechnic.    The violence and campus closures last week are the latest manifestation of the tragic deterioration of conditions on Kenya's campuses, marked by a cycle of student protest, violent government crackdown and angry student counter-response. The past two years have witnessed government bans on the formation of independent student organizations and student unions, the repeated suspension and expulsion of student leaders, the routine presence of security forces and police informers on campus, the indiscriminate use of lethal force against student protesters, and periodic closure of the leading universities in Kenya.    On December 17, 1996, Festus okong'o Etaba, an unarmed first-year student at Egerton University, was shot and killed by police during a student demonstration demanding a partial refund of fees allegedly owed students by the university. The following day, police shot and killed Kenneth Makokha Mutabi and Eric Kamundi, both unarmed, who were among a group of students at Kenyatta University who had gathered peacefully to mourn the death of Mr. Etaba and to protest the use of lethal force by police against student protesters. After the deaths of the two students at Kenyatta University, Vice-Chancellor George Eshiwani claimed that he had not called in the police and that the police had actively defied his demand that they leave the campus.    On February 23, 1997, Mr. Solomon Muruli, a student leader at Nairobi University, was killed after a suspicious early morning explosion and fire in his dormitory room. Mr. Muruli, who had helped organize a series of campus demonstrations protesting government neglect of the universities and favoritism in the award of student loans, previously reported having been abducted and tortured by police in November 1996 and had identified a senior police officer as one of his abductors. Less than two weeks before his death, Mr. Muruli reported having received death threats. Nairobi University was closed for over a month following students protests over the failure of the authorities to protect Mr. Muruli.    Since the death of Mr. Muruli, there have been several reports of student leaders being trailed by persons unknown to them and of threats of violence against student leaders. In one incident, student leaders at Kenyatta University reported to campus authorities that they were being harassed and stalked by unknown persons seeking to intimidate them. In another incident, Janai Robert Orina, Waikwa Wanyoike, and James Nduko, leaders of the National Youth Movement, an umbrella organization formed to advocate on behalf of students and to promote democratic reforms, received phone calls threatening physical violence should they continue to take part in political rallies.    We believe that the root of the campus violence, ongoing student unrest and tragic loss of human life has been the consistent failure of the government to protect the internationally guaranteed rights of all individuals to freedom of expression, assembly and association. These rights, guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified by Kenya on May 1, 1972) are violated when students are attacked for non-violently expressing their views, when independent student organizations are banned, and when peaceful student assemblies are violently dispersed by police.    Accordingly, we respectfully call on the government of Kenya to immediately implement measures to ensure that students' basic civil and political rights are protected, and to promote a return to a campus atmosphere in which rational discourse, open exchange of ideas and critical inquiry are allowed to flourish. The Kenyan government has an obligation to respect the right of students to express their views on matters of public concern and to form or join associations to promote their common interests, and must ensure that unwarranted police presence on campus and violent police dispersal of peaceful student assemblies cease immediately. When police are deployed on campus, moreover, the government has an obligation to ensure that they comply with international standards regarding the use of force and firearms and the protection at all times of the lives of innocent citizens. The lives of non-violent student protesters must be respected.    We also call on the government to rigorously pursue thorough and fair investigations into each of the student deaths, with timely disclosure to the public of the results of those investigations and with trials for those believed to have been responsible for the deaths. The perpetrators must be brought to justice. We believe that public accountability is essential if there is to be a lasting resolution of the crisis on Kenya's campuses.    Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.    Sincerely,    Jonathan Fanton Co-Chair, Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee    Peter Takirambudde Executive Director  Human Rights Watch/Africa","Africa, Kenya","Free Speech"

Dr. Fathi Ahmed Subuh, a professor of education at al-Azhar University in Gaza, is also director of the Touffah Educational Development Center, an independent not-for-profit organization that runs an array of community education programs in Gaza. He has been held for two weeks without any official explanation and has been denied visits by his family and lawyer. Dr. Subuh's arrest occurred shortly after he gave an exam to students at al-Azhar University in Gaza asking them to analyze administrative corruption in the university and in the Palestinian Authority, and at a time when the Touffah Center is the subject of ongoing government scrutiny.  A copy of the letter to President Arafat follows. July 16, 1997 Yasser Arafat President, Palestinian Authority Al-Muntada Gaza Dear President Arafat: We are writing this open letter on behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee to express our grave concern over the arrest of Dr. Fathi Ahmed Subuh, a professor of education at al-Azhar University in Gaza, a former Fulbright scholar, and a community leader widely respected for the independence of his views and his pioneering work in preschool and adult education. Dr. Subuh was arrested at his home on July 2, 1997 by officers of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service (PSS). No charges have yet been filed against him and no explanation has been given for his arrest. Palestinian human rights groups report that Dr. Subuh initially was held in incommunicado detention, was not brought before a judge within 48 hours as required under Palestinian law, and was denied access to a lawyer. Family members report that they were denied visitation rights and that Dr. Subuh started a hunger strike to protest his incarceration. More recent reports state that members of the Human Rights Committee in the Palestinian Legislative Council have been allowed to visit Dr. Subuh, and the Palestinian High Court of Justice has given the PSS eight days to respond to inquiries from Dr. Subuh's attorneys concerning the reasons for his arrest, his lack of access to his attorneys and the procedural irregularities involved in his arrest and detention. Dr. Subuh has ended his hunger strike, but is still being held without charge. Dr. Subuh reportedly irritated the authorities by giving an examination at al-Azhar University on June 21, 1997 in which he asked students to analyze administrative corruption at the university and within the Palestinian Authority. Dr. Subuh was summoned by the dean of the university, Dr. Riad al-Khoudari, who told him that the university would investigate his academic conduct. He was then arrested. The authorities have denied that Dr. Subuh's arrest has anything to do with his university work, but his unexplained arrest in the midst of the controversy over the exam questions is cause for concern for the entire academic community.  Without clarification of the reasons for Dr. Subuh's arrest, other Palestinian academics cannot be free from fear that their teaching methods might put them in danger of arrest. A university cannot fulfill its paramount role in fostering free inquiry, rational discourse, and open exchange of ideas where professors must work under such conditions.  We are also concerned with the impact that Dr. Subuh's unexplained arrest is having on the NGO community. In addition to his work as a professor, Dr. Subuh directs the Touffah Educational Development Center, an autonomous not-for-profit organization that runs an array of innovative educational programs, including leadership and vocational programs for women, a preschool teacher training program, and literacy campaigns. A number of commentators and acquaintances of Dr. Subuh report that the Touffah Center has been under scrutiny by authorities who view the autonomy of the institution as a threat. Once again, in the absence of clarification of the reasons for Dr. Subuh's arrest, such speculation cannot be put to rest, with negative consequences for the NGO sector as a whole. As educators who share the interests of our colleagues around the world when their rights are jeopardized, we respectfully request an explanation of the legal basis for the arrest of Dr. Subuh and specification of the evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Dr. Subuh. In the absence of such evidence, we urge that Dr. Subuh be released immediately and unconditionally. We also respectfully call on the leadership of the Palestinian Authority to ensure that the autonomy of universities and other institutions of civil society is respected.

A new UN report on the human rights situation in Congo/Zaire, submitted to the General Assembly by the joint investigative mission of the Commission on Human Rights, found that some of the alleged massacres could constitute acts of genocide. It also concluded that """"there are reliable indications that persons belonging to one or other of the parties to the conflict...probably committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, particularly article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949"""" and that """"[s]uch crimes seem to be sufficiently massive and systematic to be characterized as crimes against humanity."""" Such crimes, the report suggested, may be appropriate for prosecution by an international criminal tribunal, such as those created for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. """"Given the seriousness of these findings, it is imperative that the U.N. conduct an investigation that could constitute the first step toward criminal prosecution of those responsible for these crimes,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Furthermore, the creation of a war crimes commission would be a clear signal that the U.N. is not abandoning the team established by the U.N. Human Rights Commission. By elevating the stature of the investigation, the U.N. can also show its determination not to make concessions in the face of the objections by an abusive government to the composition of the team.""""   The July 14 letter by Human Rights Watch recommended that in light of the findings of the report of the joint investigative mission, the Secretary-General request the Security Council to authorize immediately the creation of a Commission of Experts with the explicit mandate not only to investigate the alleged atrocities but also to determine whether the creation of an international tribunal is warranted. A copy of the letter is attached.  July 14, 1997 Secretary-General Kofi Annan United Nations Headquarters New York, NY 10017  By Hand  Dear Mr. Secretary-General:  We write to convey once again Human Rights Watch's serious concerns about how the United Nations has responded to objections by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the U.N.'s investigation of alleged atrocities in eastern Congo. In addition, in light of the newly released report of the joint mission conducting an initial part of that investigation, we offer recommendations for overcoming these objections in a manner that ensures the integrity of the U.N. human rights machinery.  As we have expressed repeatedly, Human Rights Watch fears that permitting the government charged with abuses to exclude Roberto Garretón, a top-notch and highly experienced human rights rapporteur, from the investigation will assuredly encourage other accused governments to attempt similar maneuvres to hinder effective inquiry. It will also encourage self-censorship among other U.N. rapporteurs. Mr. Garretón published a preliminary report in an effort to save lives while massacres were underway, a procedure followed previously by the Special Rapporteur for Rwanda, who issued a similar report during the Rwandan genocide. Rather than encourage such a laudable preventive initiative, which was found to be completely justified during killings in 1994, the U.N. now appears to be censuring an attempt to halt ongoing slaughter.  The recommendation by the joint mission, in its report released on July 11 (A/51/942), that the Security Council create a standing commission of experts offers an opportunity to deal with the objections of the Congolese government while at the same time ensuring an effective investigation.  The report states (para. 80) that some of the alleged massacres could constitute acts of genocide. It also concludes (para. 95) that """"there are reliable indications that persons belonging to one or other of the parties to the conflict . . . probably committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, particularly article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949"""" and that """"[s]uch crimes seem to be sufficiently massive and systematic to be characterized as crimes against humanity."""" Such crimes, the report suggests, may be appropriate for prosecution by an international criminal tribunal, such as those created for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.  In light of these findings, Human Rights Watch respectfully calls on you to request the Security Council to authorize immediately the creation of a Commission of Experts with the explicit mandate not only to investigate the alleged atrocities but also to determine whether the creation of an international tribunal is warranted. The commission should be composed of human rights professionals with experience in investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should be authorized to maintain full-time investigators in the region for as long as it deems necessary to fulfill its mandate. The commission should be required to publish periodic, public reports and to work closely with other relevant agencies of the U.N., including those created by the Commission on Human Rights.  Should the Security Council decline to act, you should act on your own authority to establish a commission of investigation of similar stature and mandate. Such a commission, whether established by the Security Council or by the Secretary-General, must not be taken as a substitute for the joint mission of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. It must be seen as elevating the stature of the investigation because of the seriousness of the charges, not as rewarding an accused government for hindering investigation of the allegations. To this end, it is imperative that you also continue to press for the free access of the joint mission of the Human Rights Commission to Congo. Otherwise, other governments that are accused of abuses in the future will have available an unfortunate precedent to hide their apparent crimes from public scrutiny.

They include General Ratko Mladic, who personally presided over the slaughter in Srebrenica, and Radovan Karadzic, the political mastermind of the Bosnian genocide. NATO knows where to find these and other accused killers and has the legal duty and the means to capture them.   Of the 78 people on all sides publicly indicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, 66 remain at large. They include General Ratko Mladic, who personally presided over the slaughter in Srebrenica, and Radovan Karadzic, the political mastermind of the Bosnian genocide. NATO knows where to find these and other accused killers and has the legal duty and the means to capture them.   But with the exception of NATO's first arrests of suspected war criminals Thursday (one of whom was killed), Western political leaders have refused to order their arrest. If peace is to endure beyond the planned withdrawal of NATO troops in June 1998, the indicted war criminals must be apprehended.   Many suspects - including Mr. Karadzic and General Mladic - enjoy not only freedom but power: They obstruct the return of refugees, suppress dissent and use violence and intimidation to enforce their vision of ethnically ''pure'' states. As long as the suspected war criminals keep their influence, real peace is impossible and any NATO exit strategy is doomed to fail.   Many Western leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana Madariaga, argue that arresting indicted war criminals is the responsibility of the region's governments, not international troops. However, all the unarrested defendants have taken refuge in areas controlled by forces of their own ethnicity, which, in turn, refuse to arrest them.   Despite considerable financial pressure, neither the Republika Srpska, where most of the suspects live, nor Serbia has handed over a single indictee, and Croatia has surrendered only two. While tough and sustained financial pressure on Zagreb may yield further cooperation, Pale and Belgrade have indicated that they will never cooperate regardless of the financial pressure imposed. To say that it is up to the local parties to make arrests is effectively to say that there will be no arrests.   In a similar buck-passing maneuver, some Western military commanders have asserted that arresting indicted war criminals is a ''police function'' that should be divorced from the military duties of NATO troops. This betrays a disappointing lack of vision and an inadequate understanding of the contemporary requirements for international security and world order. Since the end of the Cold War, the most common reason for deploying NATO troops has been not to counter classic international aggression but to mitigate humanitarian hardship caused by highly abusive forces.   A functioning international system of justice is an essential tool for deterring such atrocities in the future - before it becomes necessary to risk the lives of international troops. Officials who contemplate mass murder are likely to think twice if they believe they may be brought to justice for their crimes.   Despite NATO's legal obligation to help arrest war criminals, political leaders have so far given NATO troops instructions to arrest only suspects whom they ''encounter.'' But even this mandate has proven farcical, as NATO troops go out of their way to avoid any such encounters.   The ''War Criminal Watch'' Web site (http:www.wcw.org/wcw/news/html) regularly updates the whereabouts of most of the suspects, a number of whom are living openly in the same towns where they committed ethnically motivated murder, rape, mutilations and expulsions.   Perhaps the most significant factor weighing on the minds of Western military leaders, particularly in Washington, is the risk involved in making arrests, especially the risk from Bosnian Serb troops. Most agree that NATO's superior firepower would overwhelm what portion of the disoriented and disillusioned Bosnian Serb army might be guarding the indicted war criminals. Instead, they fear retaliation later: sniping or hostage-taking directed against NATO troops or the many international workers in Bosnia. But this risk is both containable and necessary to take in order to avoid greater risks to the peace process and the prospects for a system of international justice.   To overcome the ''Somalia syndrome'' that is paralyzing the Pentagon, lleadership is needed from Europe. Many European militaries taking part in the earlier UN peacekeeping force suffered casualties in Bosnia. Europeans have shown that they understand the need to take some risks in order to avoid far greater ones down the road. European leadership is thus needed to overcome American shortsightedness and to ensure that the indicted war criminals are arrested before it is too late.

According to sources in Bosnia and Hercegovina, the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) apprehended Milan Kovacevic, director of the Prijedor hospital, without incident. Simultaneously, SFOR troops elsewhere in the Prijedor municipality attempted to arrest former Chief of Police Simo Drljaca, but when Drljaca fired on SFOR troops, he was shot and killed. SFOR's apprehension efforts were based on sealed indictments against Kovacevic and Drljaca. Whereas we regret that a death resulted during the apprehensions, we commend the NATO forces on their actions, and encourage them immediately to take action to arrest other individuals indicted for war crimes, specifically Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.   Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, in a January 1997 report entitled """"The Unindicted: Reaping the Rewards of Ethnic Cleansing,"""" detailed the current and past crimes for which Drljaca and Kovacevic are allegedly responsible .   * * *   Simo Drljaca: Former Chief of Police and Head of Secret Police   Simo Drljaca, one of the most notorious police officials in the whole of former Yugoslavia, controlled the civil and secret police during the Serb takeover of the Prijedor area in 1992 and was later appointed vice-minister of internal affairs (under the Ministry of the Interior) of the [then so-called] Republika Srpska. Numerous news reports, survivor accounts, and an extensive investigation by the U.N. Commission of Experts have indicated that Drljaca played a major role in the organization and management of the concentration camps in the Prijedor area.   According to an IFOR source, Drljaca was appointed directly by Radovan Karadzic to command the police force of five municipalities in the Prijedor area. He reportedly led a brutal military police-type unit during Operation Storm [in Croatia], which gave him a bad reputation among young soldiers and police.(1) From 1992-1995, Drljaca's police force continued to persecute non-Serbs, and there is ample evidence to suggest his direct involvement in the """"disappearance"""" of a Catholic priest, Father Tomislav Matanovic, and his parents in September 1995.   After the signing of the Dayton agreement, Drljaca personally obstructed freedom of movement and the return of refugees and displaced persons, going so far as to hand out weapons to the local population to threaten returnees.(2)   Drljaca's immediate supervisor is Minister of the Interior Dragan Kijac who is based in Bjeljina, the seat of the Ministry of the Interior and the Republika Srpska police. In June 1996, an IFOR source told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, """"Drljaca has complete power, maintaining control through the police and the military. [Mayor] Stakic is under Drljaca's thumb...Stakic won't meet with me on certain subjects unless Drljaca is present."""" The source claimed that Drljaca was """"controlled by Pale,"""" through limiting or granting him funds, calling him to Pale frequently, and controlling information passed to him.   Drljaca's cooperation with the U.N. mission, and more recently, with IPTF has been minimal, but there was surprisingly little international attention to his behavior until an altercation with IFOR in September 1996 . He remained police chief for nine months following the signing of the Dayton agreement, despite his history and his numerous violations of the Dayton agreement.   An IPTF report dated November 2, 1996, which was given by a third party to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, states, """"The impression by Prijedor IPTF, IFOR and ECMM, is that Drljaca is clearly wielding power and influence in Prijedor. The question at hand is whether this influence extends to the local police. From the sightings listed above [in the IPTF report] and the information of Drljaca's new position with the Ministry, it appears to be the case. The fact that Drljaca is traveling in police vehicles gives further credence to this conclusion.""""(3) Rather than being dismissed from his post, Drljaca was actually promoted to special assistant to Minister of the Interior Dragan Kijac. Drljaca describes his new role as """"security advisor,"""" according to IPTF. Drljaca has also referred to himself as """"logistics officer.""""   At a November 29 IFOR press conference, IPTF spokesman Alexander Ivanko acknowledged that Drljaca had been seen four times by IPTF, and that IPTF Prijedor believed he was still in operational control of the Prijedor police. Ivanko stated """"We've raised this with Minister Kijac, he has reassured us-I'm not sure we can believe his reassurances-but he has reassured us that Simo Drljaca no longer has any influence in the area of Prijedor. As far as we know, Simo Drljaca nevertheless is an assistant to Minister Kijac, in charge of logistics."""" Drljaca was also seen in December 1996 by IPTF in an apparent police function.   According to information given to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki in January 1997 by an IPTF source, Drljaca is still the de facto chief of police, and """"controls all police issues."""" He also carries an illegal weapon and is accompanied by armed body guards at all time.   IFOR sources have confirmed to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, and IPTF sources strongly suspect, that Drljaca is heavily involved in organized crime.(4)   Simo Drljaca: Wartime Activities   According to Kozarski Vjesnik, a Serbian-controlled newspaper in Prijedor:   The man (Simo Drljaca), who the Serbian Democratic Party of the Opstina Prijedor put in charge of forming the Serbian police after half a year of illegal work, had done his job so well that in thirteen police stations, 1,775 well-armed persons were waiting to undertake any difficult duty in the time which was coming. Between April 29 and 30, 1992, he directed the takeover of power [by the Serbs] which was successfully achieved in only thirty minutes without any shots fired. The assembly of the Srpske Opstine Prijedor, at the end of March last year [1992], appointed him chief of the public security station (i.e. in charge of the secret police). He was in charge of this job during the most demanding period and remained in the position until January 1993. These days he has been appointed the vice-minister of Internal Affairs of the Serbian Republic.(5)   In an interview with Kozarski Vjesnik on April 9, 1993, Drljaca stated:   """"In the collecting centers of Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje more than 6,000 informative conversations(6) were held. Of these people, 1,503 Muslim and Croats were transferred to the Manjaca camp.""""(7)   Drljaca did not explain what happened with the other 4,497. Speaking to a journalist about prisoners in the Manjaca camp, he said with regret, """"Instead of them getting their just punishment, we were forced to release them by the international powers.""""(8)   The secret and civil police, both controlled by Drljaca and the Ministry of the Interior, """"would interrogate, torture and kill camp inmates and be in charge of the psychological part of the operation,"""" according to the U.N. Commission of Experts. """"The most brutal functions of the sluzba bezbjednosti (state security) personnel could alternatively be carried out with the paramilitary units,""""(9) among them the Red Berets, a paramilitary unit possibly under the direct command of Radovan Karadzic.(10) A visit to Omarska by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (then Helsinki Watch) representatives in August 1992 confirmed that access to the camps was granted by local police authorities, not by the military, although there was considerable collaboration between the two.(11)   As Drljaca told Kozarski Vjesnik, """"They (the police forces, including the secret services) carried out my orders and the orders of the CSB (""""Centar Sluzbene Bezbjednosti,"""" or Public Security Center) Banja Luka and the Minister of Interior . . . the cooperation was excellent with the Army of Republika Srpska and with the officers of that army. The cooperation was manifested in the joint cleansing of the terrain of traitors, joint work at the checkpoints, a joint intervention group against disturbances of public order and in fighting terrorist groups.""""(12)   After local Serbs took control of the Prijedor municipality in the spring of 1992, according to the U.N. Commission, Drljaca informed all non-Serbian police officers that they would have to abide by """"Serbian law"""", display """"Serbian emblems"""", and sign a declaration of consent to abide by the regulations set by their Bosnian Serb counterparts. Few signed, and no non-Serbs remained in the police force for more than the first ten to fifteen days. Soon they were among those specifically targeted for persecution. One former Omarska detainee claims that on one occasion, twenty non-Serbian policemen from Prijedor were executed in the camp.   It has been alleged that Drljaca was one of those responsible for deciding who would be taken to the Omarska camp. A survivor of the Omarska and Manjaca camps and former acquaintance of Drljaca's told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki on November 16, 1996 that he saw Drljaca a number of times in the Omarska camp in 1992. His daughter, seeking his release, had called Drljaca, who checked a list while they were on the phone and confirmed that her father was on the list for Omarska. """"Sorry,"""" he said, """"there's nothing I can do for him."""" (13)   Peter Maas of The Washington Post further described Drljaca's role:   """"The tour of Omarska and Trnopolje was conducted by Simo Drljaca, who controls the camps and is the police chief of Prijedor, the nearest town. Drljaca flatly denied the charges of mistreatment, torture, and executions. """"Interrogation is being done the same way as it is done in America and England,"""" he said. Asked about the skeletal state of many at Omarska, he said that they were not underfed. """"They are not skeletons,"""" he boasted.""""(14)   When Chuck Sudetic of the New York Times asked Drljaca why the prisoners were so thin, Drljaca replied that the Muslims were naturally skinny because they did not eat pork and fasted each year during Ramadan. """"That's the way the Muslim nation is,"""" he said. """"Have you read the Koran?"""" Drljaca insisted that none of the prisoners had been physically mistreated and that reports of killings were untrue, and that any men who had died in the camp had died of war wounds. He also told Sudetic that all the investigators were lawyers.(15)   In August 1992, Sudetic reported: """"The most powerful warlord in the Prijedor area is the local police chief, Simo Drljaca, who runs the militia and has reportedly had serious clashes with local army officers."""" In an apparent effort to distance himself from the atrocities being committed in the concentration camps, Karadzic told the Times that Drljaca was responsible for the inhumane conditions in the camps under his control, which included Omarska and Keraterm.""""(16)   Sudetic reported: """"Undercutting denials by Serbian leaders that there is no official policy behind the forced expulsion of Muslims and Croats, Mr. Drljaca speaks frankly about how to 'cleanse' the undesirables. """"With their mosques, you must not just break the minarets,"""" he said, """"You've got to shake up the foundations because that means they cannot build another. Do that, and they'll want to go. They'll just leave by themselves.""""(17)   In 1992, Drljaca had insisted to journalist Roy Gutman(18) of Newsday that no one was killed at Omarska, and that only two prisoners had died between May 25 and mid-August, both of """"natural causes."""" Another forty-nine """"disappeared,"""" including the former lord mayor of Prijedor, Muhamed Cehajic, and were presumed dead, Drljaca told Gutman.(19) But Simo Drljaca later told Gutman that """"in legal terminology, we use that term 'disappeared.' Maybe some who 'disappeared' died in 'disappearing.'""""(20)   In the Bosnian Serb version of events, detainees were interrogated for four days and then deported - voluntarily. Drljaca told Newsday that the 800 detainees who """"organized the whole thing"""" (the alleged """"conspiracy to overthrow the Serbs""""), among them rich Bosniaks who allegedly financed the Bosniak SDA political party, were taken to Manjaca """"to await criminal trial."""" Taken with them were 600 people who reportedly commanded units of Bosniak and Bosnian Croat resistance. The remaining 1,900 persons [of the approximately 3000 people Drljaca admitted to arresting and taking to Omarska] were found """"innocent"""" and taken immediately to Trnopolje, which officials, including Drljaca, referred to as """"a transit camp,"""" but was actually a deportation center.(21)   In fact, relatively few interrogations were conducted before transfers to the various camps, and only a handful of detainees had ever carried arms, according to Gutman's extensive and detailed reporting.(22)   A survivor of Keraterm and Trnopolje said in November 1992:   """"On July 17, 1992, at 5:30 a.m., Simo Drljaca, chief of police, ordered my second arrest. Three civilian policemen and a driver took me in a police car first to the police station and then to the town camp 'Keraterm'.... 'Keraterm' was a plant built to produce tiles and thermic products. It was never opened, and its plant floors and depots were turned into a notorious camp enclosed by wire fence, well guarded, with machine-gun nests and a huge dredger which overlooked prisoners like a ghost. Between 850 to 1000 people would be brought to the camp daily, depending on the extent of 'cleansing' in the town and its surroundings....I spent 53 days in 'Keraterm' and in the prison hospital. I watched people being beaten up and murdered...""""(23)   Another survivor reports that:   """"Around June 20th, the ethnic cleansing of the villages of Motric and Carevac was carried out. Serbs simply took away the people who were at their homes or worked in the field. They killed some of them, mainly young men, placed others on the buses and transferred some of them to Keraterm, while the rest of them were allegedly taken to Omarska. In Keraterm some twenty guards readily waited for them with special beating implements like baseball bats, chains, battery cables, and extremely flexible metal hoses with a metal ball on the end. They would take them in groups of ten and they did not watch where they hit them. Especially brutal was Dusan Knezevic, called Duca, who pierced some people's thighs with a bayonet....[One night] they started shooting with automatic guns...we realized what had happened in the morning. 'Autotransport' [sic] FAP 1620 trailer truck came in the morning. A certain Pero whom I knew from earlier drove it. The guards took some people from our sleeping-room and ordered [them] to load bodies on the truck. There were ninety-eight dead and sixty-four wounded....the following night, July 25-26th, we again heard machine-gun fire in the same room...I counted. Exactly twenty-one shots.""""(24)   Drljaca finally escorted Peter Maas and some other journalists to Keraterm, where he refused to allow them to see the building where prisoners had actually been held, and then to Omarska and Trnopolje, where the journalists met starving men who spoke with them in hushed tones about the terror of the camps.   An IFOR source recently told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki that Drljaca """"ran the camp at Omarska....was appointed directly by Karadzic...[and is] up for the Hague Tribunal."""" The source added that Drljaca owns the 'Aeroklub' restaurant and a perfume shop in Prijedor.(25)   Simo Drljaca and the Prijedor """"Mafia""""   According to two IFOR sources assigned to the Prijedor area with access to intelligence information, and IPTF sources, Drljaca also heads a well-organized crime ring. The police reportedly """"take a cut"""" on all major financial transactions in the town, and some local businesses are required to pay Drljaca """"protection money."""" Local Serbs and non-Serbs alike fear Drljaca and his men.   IFOR confirmed that Drljaca controls the local Property Commission and the local Commission on Displaced Persons and Refugees, and therefore controls housing in the Prijedor municipality. """"If you know Simo, you can get a house,"""" one IFOR officer told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. """"If you don't, you can pay him. Everyone in Prijedor knows this.""""(26) This source also stated that Drljaca was involved in the destruction of over ninety Bosniak houses in the village of Hambarine, outside Prijedor, in October 1996.   The Boston Globe confirmed through Western sources in Prijedor who had talked to local residents about Drljaca that """"In addition to controlling officials from the mayor on down, Drljaca is alleged by residents to have demanded kickbacks for apartments and police protection of businesses. Locally, his name is 'Mr. Ten Percent' for the rate he demands from area businesses and restaurants. . .Bosnian Serbs who don't toe the party line allege they had to pay the police to avoid being evicted from their apartments"""" and have been called in to the police station, where they were threatened by Drljaca in """"informative talks"""" (interrogations) after speaking with Western officials.(27)   Milan """"Mico"""" Kovacevic: Director of Prijedor Hospital   Milan """"Mico"""" Kovacevic, an original member of the """"Crisis Committee,"""" now serves as director of the Prijedor Hospital. In his book Seasons in Hell, Ed Vulliamy stated:   """"Milan Kovacevic, the big, impervious and haunted deputy mayor of the now Serbian-controlled town of Prijedor...[is] the man responsible for the delivery of Muslim prisoners to the Omarska concentration camp...""""We must understand,"""" he says, """"that wherever there are Serbs, there is Serbia, and that Serbs cannot be 'free from persecution' until Kalabic's and Moljevic's(28) frontiers are secure from all the enemies of the Serbian narod [people or nation]"""". . . Kovacevic was born in a Croatian concentration camp during the Second World War. Outside the window of his office, Muslim women are queuing at the police station for news of their menfolk, whom they have not seen since they were taken away to Kovacevic's camps two months ago.""""(29)   Later, Kovacevic tells Vulliamy, """"What you will find here are not concentration camps, but transit centres. We are a people born out of concentration camps, determined to protect our nation from genocide again."""" He then said, """"I understand your priorities, but I do not have the authority to allow you to go to Omarska."""" This, after Vulliamy had been informed by Colonel Vladimir Arsic(30)and Major Milutinovic of the local Bosnian Serb command that the camp was run by civilian authorities.(31)   Roy Gutman, journalist for Newsday, also interviewed Kovacevic on October 18, 1992. """"Milan Kovacevic, the city manager in Prijedor, said Omarska was an investigative facility, set up 'to see who did what during the war, to find the guilty ones and to establish the innocent so that they didn't bear the consequences.' He said the camp was closed when the investigation was completed."""" Gutman's book contains a photo of Kovacevic in a U.S. Marines t-shirt, sitting with Drljaca at the time.(32)   In the aforementioned February 1996 article for The Guardian, Ed Vulliamy speaks of Kovacevic:   """"The man responsible for the day-to-day administration of Camp Omarska was Dr. Milan Kovacevic, and anaesthetist by profession. He was a bear of a man with a pale moustache and he told us there was nothing the world could teach the Serbs about concentration camps, since he had been born in one....After our discovery of Omarska, when the media circus descended on Prijedor and the camp was hurriedly closed, Dr. Kovacevic was assigned the task of explaining to the world's cameras what a """"collection centre"""" was.... Dr. Kovacevic, it turns out, is now director of Prijedor Hospital. He remains a proud nationalist. ?The facts showed it necessary to destroy Bosnia. I wanted to make this Serb land. Without Muslims, yes. We cannot live together. I still hold that view.""""(33)   According to a reliable local source, the majority of aid to the Prijedor Hospital is siphoned off by Kovacevic and Mayor Stakic.   Kovacevic recently accepted a donation of 350,000 DM from UNHCR for the hospital in Prijedor, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki was told in November by an U.N. Civil Affairs officer, who showed Human Rights Watch/Helsinki a news item which stated that the money was for the renovation of part of the hospital for use as a geriatric center.(34)   A confidential source with direct knowledge of hospital affairs told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki that the fuel, clothing, and medication given to the Prijedor hospital by the U.N. or IFOR/SFOR is taken by Kovacevic and Mayor Stakic. According to the source, fuel designated for the hospital is sold in gas stations in Prijedor and the other items are given to the Bosnian Serb Army or are sold on the black market.   Non-Serbs are afraid to use the hospital, because they are fearful they will not receive good treatment and also because treatment for those without medical insurance is prohibitively expensive. Most non-Serbs do not have medical insurance, having been disenfranchised after the takeover.   Milan Kovacevic, according to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki sources, had meetings in 1992 with the military and civilian police and SDS leaders about what to do about the non-Serb staff of the hospital. The heads of the hospital departments reportedly still work very closely with the SDS.(35)   According to Physicians for Human Rights and the U.N. Commission of Experts, during the war, a number of doctors """"disappeared"""" and are believed to have been killed in Omarska, among them the following persons: Osman Mahmuljan, internist; Enes Begic, surgeon; Zeljko Sikora, gynecologist; and Razim Music, neuropsychiatrist (he may have survived, according to a Human Rights Watch/Helsinki source). The director of the hospital during the time of the """"disappearances"""" was Radojka Elenko, who still works as an internist at the hospital.   According to a report by Physicians for Human Rights, """"By May 1992, most non-Serb with white-collar jobs, including physicians, had been removed from their posts [in Prijedor]. . When Bosnian Serb forces captured the town of Prijedor, they took special care to detain """"all the prominent people of Prijedor,"""" as one former resident of the town told PHR. This included health professionals, such as internist Osman Mahmuljan, gynecologist Zeljko Sikora, and ear-nose-and threat specialist Esad Sadikovic.""""(36)   According to reports, during the war, the heads of the hospital were working in collaboration with the army and the police. """"Police and military came into the hospital, made a list of all the staff of the hospital, and used that list to take people away from the hospital. They took some people away from the hospital directly, and others from their homes.""""(37)   Roy Gutman of Newsday reported: """"The [non-Serb] mayor was deported to the notorious Omarska camp, while his wife, a physician and medical director of the Prijedor hospital, was told not to report to work. On May 28, 1992, all hospital personnel were stopped on their way to work and divided into groups based on presumed ethnicity. Only Serbs were allowed into the hospital, while non-Serbs were either returned home or deported to concentration camps.""""(38)","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","International Justice"

According to Human Rights Watch, Dr. Ben Salem has been the target of a """"coordinated government campaign of harassment"""" because of his political views. Dr. Ben Salem has been jailed twice by the current government, most recently from 1990-1993 for giving an interview to an Algerian newspaper in which he criticized the Tunisian government for human rights abuses and for what he viewed as the government's hostility to Islam. Although there have been no new charges made against him since 1993, he has not been allowed to resume his teaching post, and has been barred even from entering the campus to retrieve his books and papers. Dr. Ben Salem reports that police are stationed outside his door at all times, his activities and those of his wife and children are constantly monitored, visitors are subjected to identification checks, his mail service is irregular and unreliable, and he has been denied a passport. A copy of the letter to President Ben Ali follows. July 7, 1997 Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali President of the Republic Palais Presidentiel Tunis, Tunisia Your Excellency: We are writing this open letter on behalf of the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch to protest the treatment of Dr. Moncef Ben Salem, a founder of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Sfax and a former visiting professor at the University of Maryland and the University of Michigan. For nearly a decade, Dr. Ben Salem has paid a high personal and professional price for his political convictions. In November 1987, Dr. Ben Salem was arrested and held in detention for nearly a year and a half, accused by the Tunisian government of being active in the outlawed organization Mouvement de la Tendance Islamique. No formal charges were brought against him. Although he was released in May 1989, he was not allowed to resume his duties as professor. In April 1990, Dr. Ben Salem was arrested again, this time for giving an interview to an Algerian newspaper in which he criticized the Tunisian government for human rights abuses and for what he viewed as the government's hostility to Islam. Charged with """"disseminating false information,"""" Dr. Ben Salem was sentenced to three years in prison.  Since his release in 1993, Dr. Ben Salem has lived under virtual house arrest. He has been the target of a coordinated government campaign of harassment and isolation. Police are stationed permanently outside his door and follow him, his wife and his children wherever they go. Acquaintances, he says, are discouraged from visiting because of identification checks carried out by the police posted outside his residence. Dr. Salem reports that his mail service is irregular and unreliable, and that he has been denied a passport. Dr. Ben Salem continues to be prevented from resuming his duties at the university, and, indeed, has been forbidden even from entering the campus to retrieve his books and papers from his office. As academic leaders, scientists and scholars dedicated to human rights, we deplore the continuing restrictions on Dr. Ben Salem's liberty.

At least one senior FUNCINPEC official, Ho Sok, a secretary of state in the Interior Ministry, is reported to have been executed by a shot to the head. He had reportedly been given refuge at the Singaporean embassy on Sunday night but left the embassy on Monday and was immediately arrested. He was taken by security officers to the judiciary police in the Ministry of Interior. A CPP statement on Tuesday initially said he had committed suicide, but Gen. Khieu Sopheak, an adviser to Hun Sen, made a more ambiguous statement later.""""He was arrested by the government troops and he has died,'' the Associated Press quoted Sopheak as saying. Other reports indicate that some twenty FUNCINPEC members were arrested in Prey Veng. The publisher of a newspaper called Sangkros Khmer that had been critical of the CPP has disappeared; human rights monitors in Phnom Penh fear he may be in custody. In Battambang, the FUNCINPEC police commissioner, Von Chun Ly, was arrested together with twelve of his bodyguards. Unconfirmed reports received early Tuesday said that FUNCINPEC General Nhek Bun Chhay had been arrested thirty kilometers outside Phnom Penh. Human Rights Watch/Asia said anyone linked to FUNCINPEC or the other two opposition parties, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party and the Khmer Nation Party, appeared to be in danger, as did anyone who had publicly criticized the CPP. """"Hun Sen and the CPP must be held fully responsible for the human rights abuses that have occurred thus far. Cambodia's donors, investors and neighbors need first and foremost to give all possible assistance to those in danger, including offering refuge in embassies as needed,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. """"They should also issue an unambiguous warning that the CPP government will be cut off from the economic assistance Cambodia so badly needs unless arrests of suspected political opponents cease immediately, those already arrested are released, and an impartial inquiry into the death of Ho Sok is immediately initiated,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. Donor countries pledged $450 million in aid to the Cambodian government last week in Paris.  She welcomed reports of the Japanese government's decision to suspend aid and praised the ASEAN governments' calling for an immediate ceasefire and their decision to call an emergency meeting to review the decision to grant Cambodia membership. """"These actions stand in sharp contrast to those of the U.S., France, Australia and some other industrialized countries which have equivocated about calling this coup a coup.""""","Asia, Cambodia",""

Of the seventy-six people from all sides publicly indicted so far, only ten have been taken into custody. If peace is to endure beyond the planned withdrawal of NATO troops in June 1998, the indicted war criminals must be apprehended.   Most of the persons indicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia - including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic - enjoy not only freedom but power: they obstruct the return of refugees, suppress dissent, and use violence and intimidation to enforce their vision of ethnically """"pure"""" states. While western leaders - including, most recently, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana - often argue that arresting indicted war criminals is the responsibility of the region's governments, not international troops, all the unarrested have taken refuge in areas controlled by military forces of their own ethnicity, which, in turn, refuse to arrest them - despite considerable financial pressure to do so.   """"NATO knows where these men are and has the legal duty and the means to apprehend them, but Western political leaders refuse to order their arrest."""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Unless these men are apprehended, they will continue to undermine the peace process, prevent national reconciliation, and sabotage this rare opportunity to build an international system of justice.""""   Although NATO has a broad and unqualified legal obligation to assist in the apprehension of war criminals, political leaders have so far given NATO troops instructions only to arrest suspects whom they """"encounter."""" But even this limited mandate has proven farcical, as NATO troops go out of their way to avoid any such encounter, let alone to arrange """"encounters"""" on terms that might be favorable for arrest. Well over half of those indicted have been located by journalists and human rights workers. A number are living openly in the same towns where they committed ethnically motivated murder, rape, mutilation, and expulsions.   The risk that arrests could invite retaliation against NATO troops and other international workers in Bosnia is both containable, as the recent arrest of Dokmanovic has shown, and necessary to avoid greater risks to the peace process and to the prospects for a system of international justice. NATO troops and other U.N. and OSCE workers have already practiced emergency evacuation plans which can be extended to private organizations. It was precisely to resist such blackmail that the lightly armed UNPROFOR peacekeeping troops were replaced by the well armed NATO forces. In the past, when NATO troops have credibly threatened force in the face of such blackmail, Bosnian Serb troops (the main source of threats) have quickly backed down.   The only force capable of making these arrests is NATO - either on its own or by providing essential back-up to a specially created commando unit. To pass apprehension off as a """"police function,"""" as some have done, is to decide that no arrests will be made. This position reflects a disappointing lack of vision in not recognizing the importance of upholding international law against such atrocities. Since the Cold War's conclusion, the most common reason for deploying NATO troops has been to mitigate the humanitarian hardship caused by highly abusive forces. A functioning international system of justice is an essential tool for deterring such atrocities in the future. Officials who contemplate mass murder are likely to think twice if they believe they may be brought to justice for their crimes.   Human Rights Watch also announced the launch of a world-wide """"Arrest Now"""" campaign timed to coincide with the second anniversary of the fall of the so-called """"safe area"""" of Srebrenica. Press conferences are scheduled in the next week in London, Paris, Sarajevo and Washington to announce the release of letters to political leaders signed by hundreds of labor, religious, womens' and human rights groups, as well as by prominent individuals in each country.   Srebrenica has become a symbol of the atrocities committed during the war in the former Yugoslavia and of the inaction of the international community. It is time for the international community, after having failed for far too long to stop the killing in Bosnia and Hercegovina, to ensure at least that the killers are brought to justice.","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","International Justice, Peace and Justice"

""""If the president signs this law, it will be the first time since the Soviet era that Russia replaces a federal law which adequately protects the rights and freedoms of citizens with a highly restrictive one,"""" declared Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. She added:""""The adoption of this law would be a real setback, not only in the field of religious freedom but also for respect for human rights in Russia in general. It will set a dangerous precedent.""""The draft law establishes a highly discriminatory system dividing religious communities into """"religious groups"""" and """"religious organizations."""" Under the law, only religious communities which have been registered for more than 15 years can enjoy full religious freedoms and state privileges. All other religious communities are classified as religious groups which are severely restricted in their rights. In practice, this means that only the religious communities which were recognized in Soviet times can qualify as religious organizations. A copy of the letter is attached. July 8, 1997 helsinki President Boris Yeltsin Moscow, Russia By Fax: 095 206 3961 Dear Mr. President, On behalf of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki I extend my greetings. As you may know, Human Rights Watch is an international, nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization, the largest such organization based in the United States. Its Helsinki division (formerly known as Helsinki Watch) has monitored and urged compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Accords in signatory countries since the organization was formed in 1978. Our reports are widely distributed at the United Nations (Human Rights Watch has enjoyed consultative status with ECOSOC since 1993), the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the U.S. Congress, as well as among the media and other influential actors, to galvanize support for compliance with international legal obligations and principles of human rights protection.  I am writing to ask you to ensure that the draft Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religion which the State Duma adopted in third reading on Monday, June 23, 1997, meets international human rights standards. A careful analysis of the draft law has led Human Rights Watch/Helsinki to the conclusion that several provisions in the law are not compatible with Russia's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),which although it has not yet been ratified must be observed by Russia as a member of the Council of Europe, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which was ratified on October 16, 1973, nor with the Russian constitution. In particular, the law establishes a system of differential treatment of religions which appears to be in violation of the principle of non-discrimination enshrined in articles 14 and 19 of the Russian constitution, article 14 of the ECHR and article 2 of the ICCPR. Furthermore, the law contains a series of provisions that are vaguely worded and could easily be interpreted in a manner that violates the right to freedom of religion, as enshrined in article 28 of the Russian constitution, article 9 of the ECHR and article 18 of the ICCPR. The draft law introduces a division of religious communities into so-called""""religious groups"""" and """"religious organizations."""" According to the draft law, """"religious groups"""" can only become """"religious organizations"""" and obtain legal status after they have been registered with the local interior department for fifteen years. In practice, this means that apart from the so-called traditional churches, the Orthodox Church, Buddhism, Islam and Judaism, almost all other religious communities will be categorized as""""religious groups."""" """"Religious organizations"""" have a clearly advantageous position over""""religious groups,"""" as they have legal personality and """"religious groups"""" do not. """"Religious organizations"""" can therefore, in contrast to """"religious groups,"""" own property, hire employees and enjoy other rights connected to having legal personality.  In accordance with article 7 of the draft law as adopted by the State Duma on Monday June 23, 1997, """"religious groups"""" have """"the right to conduct worship services, to carry out religious rituals and ceremonies."""" Under the draft law that was adopted by the State Duma in second reading on Wednesday June 18, 1997, """"religious groups"""" were also granted the right to """"to conduct charitable and other activities which do not require the legal capacities of a legal personality."""" The fact that the right to """"conduct other activities...."""" was omitted in the third reading points to a specific wish from the side of the State Duma to limit the activities of """"religious groups"""" to conducting worship services, and carrying out religious rituals and ceremonies. In contrast to """"religious groups,"""" """" religious organizations"""" are granted a large number of rights. Some of these rights are exclusively attributed to religious organizations and can thus not be exercised by """"religious groups."""" For example, """"religious organizations"""" may create educational institutions; receive state aid for church-affiliated schools; invite foreign missionaries; request the president to exempt clergy from military service; enjoy tax privileges; receive state subsidies for restoration of historic church buildings; and have their religious holidays proclaimed as general public holidays. A number of other rights are granted to """"religious organizations"""" without a specific exclusion of """"religious groups"""" from exercising them. These include, among others, the right to publish religious materials and conduct ceremonies in places such as hospitals (see below for further discussion).Under the draft law adopted in second reading, one could argue that""""religious groups"""" would be able to exercise these rights as well because""""religious groups"""" were not explicitly excluded from exercising them and article 7 provided a legal basis for such exercise. However, after the amendment of article 7, it appears that """"religious groups"""" are excluded from exercising these rights. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes that the differential treatment described above is not consistent with article 14 of the ECHR, which states that """"[t]he enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."""" The European Court for Human Rights has established in its case-law that differential treatment of subjects does not per se constitute a violation of article 14 of the ECHR. Such treatment can be legitimate if the distinction has an objective with a reasonable justification and provided that the means employed are proportional to the aim sought to be realized. The draft Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations provides for differential treatment of religions based on the length of time they have been registered or, one could argue, on the grounds of being a traditional or non-traditional religion in the Russian Federation. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes that this division of religious communities goes a long way beyond justified differential treatment and amounts to discrimination of the so-called non-traditional religions that violates Russia's obligations under international law. Some proponents of the law have mentioned that the law is meant to protect Russian society from cults that may constitute a threat to it. While Human Rights Watch/Helsinki recognizes that states have the right to ensure that any community, including religious ones, does not constitute a threat to society, the discriminatory treatment introduced by the draft law in no way adds to such efforts. Apart from the above-mentioned discriminatory provisions, the law also contains provisions which may be in direct contradiction of international standards on freedom of religion or which are open to interpretation that would constitute a violation of the right to freedom of religion. Some examples are: Article 16(3) - """"Religious organizations have the right to carry out religious rites in health centers and hospitals, in children's homes, in old-people's homes and institutions for physically or mentally challenged, and in institutions applying sentences of imprisonment for criminal offences at the request of the citizens held there in premises specially designated by the administration for these purposes..."""" Article 17(1) - """"Religious organizations have the right to produce, acquire, export, import and distribute religious literature, printed, audio and video material and other articles of religious significance."""" Such a state of affairs would not be consistent with article 9(2) of the ECHR, which states that """"[f]reedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to those limitations as ... are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."""" Imposing restrictions on religious groups in carrying out religious rites in hospitals or in distributing religious literature can clearly not be seen as restrictions that are necessary in a democratic society and therefore would run counter to article 9(2) of the ECHR. Even if religious groups are ultimately determined to have the rights contained in articles 16(3) and 17(1) and others, the vagueness of the provisions can easily lead to interpretation by local authorities which would constitute a violation of the right to freedom of religion. Such vagueness of the law is especially troubling given that legislation is generally poorly implemented in Russia, and local authorities tend to interpret legislation more restrictively than it was meant by the legislature. In addition, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has received various reports from people belonging to non-traditional religions who spoke of harassment by local authorities and a negative attitude of many local authorities towards so-called non-traditional religions. It is therefore of special importance to ensure that legislation is clearly worded and leaves as little room as possible for differing interpretations. If this draft law enters into force, there is a real danger that harassment will increase because the law appears to give a legislative legitimation for such actions. Finally, there are a number of vaguely worded provisions in article 14 of the draft law which may lead to arbitrary restrictions of the right to freedom of religion. The article lists a number of grounds on which religious organizations can be liquidated and religious groups banned. Although this article is meant to protect society from possibly dangerous religious cults, some of its provisions may arbitrarily limit freedom of religion by imposing restrictions on the activities of certain religious groups that are not necessary in a democratic society. These provisions include, among others, the following grounds for liquidating or banning a religious association: """"forcing a family to disintegrate""""; and """"forcing members and followers of the religious association or other persons to alienate property which belongs to them for the use of the religious association."""" Mr. President, you recently announced that 1998 would be the year of Human Rights in Russia. We whole-heartedly welcomed that announcement and sincerely hope that respect for and knowledge about human rights in Russia will grow during that year. We believe, however, that the introduction of this law on religion in the run-up to 1998 would signify a false start. It would mean a return to the Soviet practice of restricting basic human rights and freedom by legislative means and set a dangerous precedent for the future. As executive director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, I therefore strongly urge you to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the draft law is brought into conformity to the Russian constitution and international human rights standards. I look forward to your reply, Yours sincerely, /s/ Holly Cartner Executive Director Human Rights Watch/Helsinki cc: Mikhail Krasnov, Presidential Advisor on Legal Affairs Georgi Satarov, Presidential Advisor on Political Affairs Teimuraz Ramishvili, Head, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department for International Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights Viktor Zorkaltsev, Chairman, Committee on Religion, State Duma Genri Mikhailov, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Church-State Relations Andrei Sebentsov, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Church-State Relations Vladimir Kartashkin, Chairman, Presidential Human Rights Commission Rudolf Bindig, Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Special Rapporteur","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Among the people left in Hong Kong after the British depart will be some 12,000 Hong Kong prisoners, including some 800 foreign nationals. Human Rights Watch/Asia and the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, recognizing that few if any groups are more vulnerable to the impact of political change than prisoners, recently investigated conditions in the Hong Kong prison system with the intention of establishing a benchmark of prison conditions prior to the territory's reversion to China. In Hong Kong: Prison Conditions in 1997, published today, the two groups offer a comprehensive appraisal of the state of the territory's prisons.  On the whole, the report concludes, the Hong Kong prison system has much to recommend it. In particular, the territory's prisons are administered by an extremely competent and professional corps of correctional officers. Under their vigilance, the prisons are relatively safe and secure, and serious physical violence is a rare occurrence. The physical infrastructure of the prison system is, with the exception of a couple of facilities, in very good shape. The Prison Rules that regulate the operation of the prisons, particularly after their recent amendment, reflect a healthy concern for prisoners' fundamental rights.  The international delegation conducting the investigation, which was the first full examination of the system by independent nongovernmental organizations, included Sir Stephen Tumim, the U.K.'s former Chief Inspector of Prisons, Joanne Mariner, a Human Rights Watch prisons expert, Law Yuk Kai, the director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, and Robin Munro, China expert at Human Rights Watch/Asia.  Given China's notoriously poor prison conditions and its frequent use of capital punishment, it is unsurprising that some Hong Kong prisoners have already expressed grave apprehensions regarding their treatment under Chinese rule. In light of these concerns, the investigation--besides establishing a benchmark of prison conditions--was also meant to establish a precedent of independent monitoring of the territory's prisons, to encourage future monitoring.  As the report explains, the Hong Kong prison system is less than exemplary with respect to a few important issues. Overcrowding, which is a problem now and, according to official estimates, will be continue to be problem for the foreseeable future, has stretched the system's resources. At the majority of the twelve facilities visited by the delegation, cells and dormitories were crowded, and many activities were tedious and not conducive to rehabilitation. Cotton ball and envelope-making, for example, tasks assigned in many facilities, hardly equip inmates with the skills necessary to find employment upon release. The combination of greater overcrowding and less meaningful ways of passing the time also aggravates the tensions which result in inmate-on-inmate violence.  The report notes that the strains of overcrowding are particularly evident with regard to unconvicted prisoners--prisoners who are presumed innocent and are supposed to be treated as such. In particular, the unremitting idleness of such prisoners, a problem that the delegation observed in every facility that houses them, is of serious concern.  The report also explains that the Hong Kong prison system maintains unnecessarily stringent controls over inmates' contacts with the outside world. Among their adverse effects, these restrictions bode poorly for prisoners' future readjustment back into society, when they will need the social connection of family and friends. For many prisoners, visits are too infrequent and too short. Moreover, prisoners in higher security facilities, who are only allowed """"closed"""" visits, are separated from their visitors by a plexiglass barrier and must speak to them via a telephone/intercom system. The resulting ban on all personal contact does have the intended effect of keeping out drugs and other contraband, which are at the root of many serious problems in other prison systems, but it exacts a high cost, particularly in relations between parents and their children.  , Hong Kong: Prison Conditions in 1997 describes and evaluates the treatment of prisoners confined in Hong Kong prisons with reference to the relevant provisions of binding international human rights treaties, and to other authoritative international standards. Among its detailed recommendations for improving the Hong Kong correctional system are the following:  Steps should be taken to ease overcrowding throughout the prison system.  Following the model of the United Kingdom, the Hong Kong government should establish an independent prisons inspectorate with a broad mandate to investigate conditions in the territory's penal facilities; report its findings to the responsible governmental authorities, to the legislature, and to the public; and make recommendations for reform.  As is common in prisons around the world, remand prisoners in Hong Kong are subject to the worst conditions. The Correctional Services Department (CSD) should take immediate steps to improve their treatment by alleviating overcrowding at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre and at Tai Lam Centre for Women, by allowing prisoners out of their day rooms more frequently, and by making greater work, recreational and educational opportunities available to them.  The Hong Kong government should take immediate steps to improve the conditions of detention centers holding Vietnamese asylum-seekers.  The CSD should take urgent steps to recruit and train the necessary quota of psychiatric nurses to staff Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre.  Consistent with the practice in other highly industrialized countries, the CSD should expand prisoners' access to telephones by installing telephones in areas accessible to prisoners and establishing appropriate rules for their use.  The CSD should relax restriction on visits. It should routinely allow prisoners--especially those whose relatives must travel long distances to see them, or whose relatives, because of age or disability, have difficulty traveling--visits of at least an hour. It should also expand its use of open (contact) visits.  Because prisoners' ability to find work upon release into the community is an important determinant of their likelihood to commit future crimes, the CSD should take greater care to provide work opportunities that help prisoners gain marketable skills.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, China and Tibet, United Kingdom",""

Neither the identity of those who attacked Castelho nor their motivation is clear.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/06/04/east-timor-guerrilla-attacks","East Timor - Guerrilla Attacks","East Timor - Guerrilla Attacks","","06/04/1997","(New York) - A series of attacks between May 27 and May 31 by resistance forces in East Timor, leading to the deaths of at least nine civilians and more than twenty military and police, has led to widespread arrests of suspected resistance supporters throughout the territory. Human Rights Watch/Asia condemns any targeting of civilians or other non-combatants by East Timorese guerrillas as being in clear violation of international humanitarian law. But it is also concerned about reports of manhunts by the military in the aftermath of the violence and widespread arrests in Dili, Baucau, Ermera and Los Palos under circumstances in which torture is likely. The International Committee of the Red Cross was expected to have access to the detainees on Monday, by which time some of those detained would have been in custody for over a week. Human Rights Watch/Asia calls on both sides of the conflict to respect international human rights and humanitarian principles and urges the Indonesian government to allow unhindered access to all parts of East Timor by human rights organizations, both domestic and international. An immediate visit to East Timor by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture would be a particularly useful precautionary measure.  The attacks over the last week appeared to be a coordinated effort by the resistance to disrupt the May 29 polling in East Timor to elect members to the Indonesian parliament. According to reports received by Human Rights Watch but not independently confirmed, the two attacks involving civilians took place in Baucau, East Timor's second largest town, and Los Palos, further east. The victims in Los Palos included an East Timorese man named Castelho, locally known as a supporter of East Timor's integration with Indonesia and therefore opposed to independence. About 8:00 p.m. on May 28, Castelho and his family, together with some schoolteachers from eastern Indonesia, were at his home watching television when guerrillas vandalized the satellite dish outside. When the group went out to see what had caused the television reception to suddenly go bad, they were confronted by guerrillas who asked why he had signed documents formalizing East Timor's integration and who then opened fire on Castelho and three of his children. Theteachers started running toward the district military command, but because all the alleyways were controlled by the guerrillas, they had no way out and were also shot and killed. Castelho was the younger brother of the head of the district parliament in Los Palos. According to this report, the guerrillas had come to Castelho's house on a motorcycle they had taken from a transmigration center in Muapitini after killing two soldiers and a transmigrant from Bali. According to a different report, the guerrillas went to the transmigration site and took a Balinese family hostage -- also in clear contravention of international humanitarian law. They eventually released the wife and child but shot and killed the man; there was no mention in the second report of soldiers having been killed.  On the same day in Baucau, guerrillas shot and killed Miguel Baptismo da Silva, aged fifty-four, and his wife. Miguel had been the head of the district parliament from 1987 to 1992. One report said they were attacked at their home; a second report said they were in their car at the time they were shot. The protection of civilians and non-combatants in situations of internal armed conflict has become a key principle of customary law and is formally set forth in Article 3, common to the Geneva Conventions, often known as the """"rules of war."""" Common Article 3 prohibits, among other things, any """"violence to life and person"""" of those taking no active part in hostilities. The attacks on the Castelho family, the Balinese migrant, and the couple in Baucau, if reports are accurate, appear to be in clear violation of that principle.  These attacks on civilians were part of a much broader wave of violence throughout East Timor. On May 27, a group of unidentified youths attacked a number of election officials in the village of Nunira, subdistrict Laga, Baucau, on the road to Baguia. Two election officials were reportedly killed, Police Sgt. Abdullah Syukur and Army Sgt. Sitepu. Four people were said to have been seriously wounded and evacuated to Dili while three others sustained less serious injuries.  On May 28, at about 8:30 p.m., Wednesday night, an estimated fourteen youths drove up in a red Kijang vehicle to a guard post of Company A of the police mobile brigade (Brimob) in Bairopite, West Dili, and said they were voters. They then opened fire. Five policemen were wounded, while three of the attackers were shot dead and two others died in the Wira Husada military hospital. A third, the driver of the vehicle, Adeliode Fatima, was detained. He and others arrested later are reportedly being held at Dili police headquarters. On May 29, in the village of Seisal, Baucau, voting was delayed a day and could only take place on Friday May 30 because the polling place was attacked by an unidentified group. An election official named Abinau Salay, who was a member of a civilian militia group called Wanra (an acronym for Perlawanan Rakyat or People's Resistance) was hacked with a machete and wounded. Ten people were arrested, according to local officials, and are detained in district police headquarters in Baucau.  On the same day, in Assumano, Liquica, a soldier was wounded when a grenade was tossed into a voting booth. Two polling places and a village administrative office were reportedly burned down in Baucau and Ermera, according to the then military commander for East Timor, Col. Mahidin Simbolon, in a statement on May 30. One soldier was reported to have been killed in one of the attacks in Ermera, but his death has not been confirmed. On May 31, another major attack took place. According to press reports, twenty-six policemen and two soldiers were driving along the road in Quelicai, Baucau, in a Hino truck, when they were stopped by several men wearing Indonesian armed forces uniforms. The truck stopped to pick up the men, when the latter threw a grenade into the truck. An oil drum of gasoline in the back of the truck exploded, and in the resulting inferno, thirteen of the people in the truck were burned to death and four were shot as they tried to escape. The dead included sixteen policemen and one soldier. It was unclear if there were any casualties among the attackers. On the same day as the grenade attack, Col. Simbolon stepped down as military commander, but it was unclear whether there was a direct connection. His designated successor, Col.Slamat Sidabutur, was not yet in place. In the aftermath of these attacks, East Timor has been effectively closed to journalists, and a massive round-up is reported to be taking place of suspected resistance supporters. According to the East Timor police chief, Col. Jusuf Muchtaram, thirteen rebels and nine of their civilian supporters were under arrest in Dili as of June 1. The army said thirty had been arrested, and more were being sought. Torture has been a common practice in East Timor as a way of extracting information about rebel movements. The comments of the division commander based in Bali, whose territorial jurisdiction includes East Timor, were not encouraging in this regard. """"I hope they cooperate by telling us where their friends are hiding out and who their mastermind is,"""" he told the Indonesian news agency, Antara.  Those arrested included veteran activist and former political prisoner David Dias Ximenes who was arrested in Bairopite, Dili on May 30 and charged with armed rebellion in connection with the attack on the Company A guard post. The charge carries a maximum sentence of twenty years. Ximenes has been allowed to see a lawyer. Five others reported arrested in connection with the same attack include two men, Joao Angelo and Francisco Magno, both from Ainaro, as well as a man named Jose Acacio and his wife. Unconfirmed reports also suggest that reprisal operations were underway in Los Palos but no clear information was available. As of June 4, the National Human Rights Commission, Komnas, had taken no action to investigate events in East Timor, as its Jakarta-based members were busy investigating election-related violence in Indonesia proper, and the Dili office did not appear to be functioning.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice, Torture"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/06/03/shenzhen-court-sentences-chinese-labor-activists","Shenzhen Court Sentences Chinese Labor Activists","Shenzhen Court Sentences Chinese Labor Activists","","06/03/1997","(New York) - More than six months after being put on trial in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on trumped-up charges of """"conspiring to subvert the government,"""" two Chinese unofficial labor movement activists, Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng, have been handed prison terms of three and one-half years each. Human Rights Watch/Asia condemned the sentences as a serious violation of international human rights standards.  """"Li and Guo were guilty of nothing more than trying to educate Chinese migrant workers about their rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining in the workplace,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. """"They should never have been detained for a single day, let alone held incommunicado for two and a half years and then sentenced to further time in jail after a closed trial."""" Li is now due to be released on November 11, 1997, and Guo on December 3, 1997. The sentences, which were lighter than expected, came only days after four worker dissidents arrested after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989 Tang Yuanjuan, Li Wei, Leng Wanbao and Li Zhongmin--reportedly had their sentences overturned or greatly reduced by the High Court in Changchun, Jilin province. If confirmed, the Jilin court's decision on Thursday would be the first known instance of any Tiananmen-era verdicts being reversed. Both the Shenzhen sentences and the Jilin decision coincide with the anniversary of the June 4, 1989 crackdown, the annual debate in the U.S. Congress over extending China's most favored nation trading status, and a bid by China to recover its worker-delegate seat at the International Labor Organization, but it is unclear if there is any causal connection. Li Wenming, twenty-nine years old and currently held in Shenzhen Municipal Jail, is reported to be suffering from acute kidney damage and to be in severe pain, but he has been denied access to appropriate medical care. His face is said to be badly swollen and he reportedly has great difficulty in even standing unaided. According to Chinese medical experts recently consulted by persons close to Li's family, the symptoms are sufficiently grave that unless Li is permitted to receive immediate treatment, he may be in imminent danger of losing at least one kidney. No information is presently available on the medical condition of Li's codefendant, Guo Baosheng, who is also currently held at Shenzhen Municipal Jail. The nature of the charges against the two men appears to have undergone significant alterations between the November 1996 prosecution indictment and the May 29, 1997 verdict. The former document characterized the pair's """"crimes"""" as consisting mainly of their attempts to set up, in 1993 and early 1994, an ad hoc worker rights education center and to produce an unofficial journal called Workers Forum which they distributed among Shenzhen's migrant worker population. The verdict, however, downplayed this aspect of the original charges and instead dwelt on new government allegations against Li and Guo, notably that they had indirectly accused Chairman Mao of having """"replaced the old feudal monarchy with a new one."""" (For background information on the two men's labor rights activism and on the government's case against them, see """"China: Labor Rights Activists On Trial in Shenzhen,"""" Human Rights Watch/Asia, November 1996.)  The long delay between the trial, which began on November 8, 1996 and concluded ten days later, and the final announcement of the sentences, which occurred only last Thursday [May 29, 1997], was in direct contravention of Article 125 of the 1979 Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, which states that judgments in criminal trials must in all cases be announced no later than one and a half months after the end of the trial. Despite this serious procedural violation, the prison sentences passed on Li and Guo were considerably lighter than might have been expected, given the gravity of the charges against them. (According to Article 92 of the version of the PRC Criminal Law that was in operation at the time of their trial, the """"counterrevolutionary"""" offense of """"conspiring to subvert the government"""" was punishable by a minimum of ten years' imprisonment and, at maximum, by death.)  The Shenzhen city authorities had evidently planned to carry out the trial of Li and Guo with a minimum of public attention, and they were clearly taken aback when the Hong Kong local and international press corps descended on the Shenzhen Intermediate Court a day or so after the trial began last November. The trial was promptly postponed for more than a week until all the journalists had departed. This, together with the long delay in announcement of the sentences, suggests that the international publicity that the case attracted may have been in part responsible for the authorities' decision to impose sentences below the legally prescribed minimum. The verdict itself noted only that the judgment was based on Article 59 (paragraph 2) of the 1979 Criminal Law, which gives courts the discretionary power to pass """"mitigated sentence"""" even when """"the circumstances of a criminal element do not warrant it.""""","Asia, China and Tibet","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/05/29/algeria-elections-shadow-violence-and-repression","Algeria--Elections in the Shadow of Violence and Repression","Algeria--Elections in the Shadow of Violence and Repression","","05/29/1997","Rampant political violence is only one of the factors standing in the way of a free and fair Algerian election on June 5, Human Rights Watch/Middle East charges in a report issued today. Media censorship, restrictions on categories of parties, the hasty promotion of a new pro-government party, and widespread repression against suspected Islamists, their families and sympathizers all weigh heavily on voters as they go to the polls. In the thirty-five page report, """"Algeria: Elections in the Shadow of Violence and Repression,"""" which is based on a two-week mission to Algeria in April, Human Rights Watch condemns grave human rights abuses committed both by the security forces and by armed Islamist groups. The report describes how the terror and repression have intimidated Algerians of varying political persuasions from becoming politically involved. Those in power in Algeria have proclaimed their hope that these elections will erase the taint they incurred when the last legislative elections were cancelled in 1992. They have claimed that the vote will culminate the restoration of democracy, and have invited foreign election observers to monitor the process.  Human Rights Watch cautions, however, against viewing the June 5 election as the capstone of the process of establishing democratic rule in Algeria. If these elections are to be a step toward ending the political stalemate, significant additional steps will be required for the Algerian people to be able, in a meaningful way, to exercise their human right to """"take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives."""" This right is central to Algeria's political crisis, since it was the denial of that right during three decades of one-party rule and when authorities annulled the country's first multi-party legislative elections which led to the political violence becoming endemic, and which has diminished in the eyes of many Algerians the legitimacy of those who govern them. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to monitor not only the elections themselves, but conditions in Algeria after the elections, and to press the government to curtail human rights abuses and to respect fully the rights of freedom of expression, association and political participation. Aid and partnership agreements with the government of Algeria should be linked to measurable progress in these domains. The report describes the following factors coloring the legislative elections, the first affecting what is at stake and the others detracting from the extent to which they should be considered free and fair. A weakened National Assembly: The Assembly to be elected on June 5 is a far weaker body than the one that was to have been chosen in 1992. The new constitution, drafted by the authorities and approved in a controversial November 1996 referendum, has stripped the assembly of many of its lawmaking powers, while strengthening the office of the president and creating a second legislative chamber, one-third of whose members are appointed by the president and two-thirds of whom are elected by local officials who themselves will have been been elected by popular vote. While international human rights standards do not dictate how power should be divided among different branches of government, it is important to note the significantly reduced powers of the institution that is being elected through popular suffrage. Ongoing political violence and repression: Although many Algerians have courageously and defiantly plunged into the campaign, the rampant violence, for which the security forces and armed Islamist groups are responsible, continues to claim scores of lives each week and has terrorized many Algerians who would wish to express their views or take part in political life. Political activists from a wide range of parties and tendencies have been assassinated since 1992, including at least five so far in the run-up to this legislative election. The report contains testimonies of Algerians who have been victimized by the security forces and by violent opposition groups. Exclusion of parties: Certain provisions of the 1996 constitution and 1997 political parties law violate the right to freedom of association by not permitting parties based on religion, region, language or gender. The Islamist Salvation Front, the movement that was poised to win the last legislative elections, was outlawed in 1992 and remains barred from any political activity. Other parties have been required to change elements of their names and program in order to comply with the law. Restrictions and favoritism: Authorities have to some extent restricted the political activities and coverage on state-controlled radio and television of some legal parties, particularly those that criticize the interruption of the last legislative elections. By contrast, the authorities have facilitated the rapid rise of the National Democratic Rally (RND), a party formed in February to mobilize support for the President and his government and which is running candidates in all districts. Media censorship: Although the Algerian print press is more free than many in the Middle East and North Africa, systematic censorship in the press of security-related news and, to a lesser extent, of criticism of government corruption and performance, deprives voters of information concerning some of the key issues in this campaign. The authorities have harrassed publications and journalists associated with independent print media, and have preserved state-controlled television as a government mouthpiece. The ability of journalists to gather and disseminate news and information has also been impeded by the unprecedented assassination campaign that has cost the lives of fifty-nine media workers since 1992. Armed opposition groups are believed responsible for most of these killings. The Human Rights Watch report addresses a series of recommendations to the government of Algeria, the countries sending election observers, and to the European Union and its member states. Human Rights Watch also makes recommendations to the armed groups.  To the government of Algeria:  End censorship and pressures on the media that aim to enforce a state monopoly on information related to the internal security situation, including human rights violations, or that aim to restrict other coverage that displeases government officials. End all measures designed to impede the peaceful activities and public expression of political parties and movements, including those that urge the inclusion of the FIS in negotiations with the government. Bring domestic legislation on political parties into conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by abolishing the prohibition on parties based on religion, gender, race or region. Such broad-based prohibitions violate the right of Algerians to freedom of association. Take steps to halt human rights abuses perpetrated by the security forces, including arbitrary detention, """"disappearances,"""" extrajudicial executions, and torture, that target suspected Islamist activists, their relatives, and suspected sympathizers. Such abuses are presently praticed with virtual impunity.  To the armed groups:  Human Rights Watch urges all armed groups to: Halt immediately deliberate attacks on civilians and noncombatants, and indiscriminate attacks that disregard the protection of civilians. Cease all activities intended to threaten or intimidate persons because of their personal or political beliefs or activities. Persons empowered to speak on behalf of the FIS, as a movement with aspirations to political power in Algeria, should clearly and unconditionally condemn attacks by armed Islamist groups against all civilians and other acts that violate basic human rights and humanitarian norms. These include all acts and threats of violence intended to intimidate Algerians who wish to exercise their right to political participation and association. Leaders of the FIS should utilize whatever influence they have over armed groups to end violence against and intimidation of civilians.  To the European Union and Member States: The European Union is presently negotiating a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Algeria similar to ones already signed between the E.U. and Morocco, Israel, and Tunisia. Algeria hopes to obtain financial aid or debt relief in the context of this accord. Article 2 of each association agreement states, """"Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of the [European] Community and of [the other party] and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement."""" Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the European Union and member states: The European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U. member states, should scrutinize not only the June 5 elections but also human rights conditions in the months that follow the elections, and make clear to the Algerian government that improved relations depend on the government's making tangible progress in improving in human rights practices and in giving greater substance to the right of Algerian people to participate in self-governance. In particular, the European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U. member states, should monitor the extent to which the elections represent a starting point for the government to redress some of the outstanding human rights issues for which authorities are responsible, such as the hundreds of cases of """"disappearances."""" They should publicly acknowledge and condemn these practices by Algerian authorities, and submit lists of names of reportedly """"disappeared"""" persons that come to their attention and request clarifications from Algiers. The European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U. member states, should assess whether state broadcasting media remain open to opposition views, as they have to a degree during the election campaign, or revert to their rigid practices of recent years, and whether the print press is allowed real freedom. They should further monitor whether the policy of granting visas relatively freely in the run-up to elections to journalists and foreign observers, including human rights monitors, will revert to the more restrictive past policy on visas. The European Parliament should adopt an urgent resolution, making reference to Article 2 of the draft Association Agreement with Algeria, requesting the European Commission and Council of Ministers to undertake the above recommendations and to report back to the Parliament with regard to these undertakings. The European Parliament should itself undertake to document human rights developments in Algeria in the post-election period.  Countries Sending Election Observers: Those countries participating in the multi-national election monitoring effort have a responsibility to provide a frank and public assessment of the atmosphere for free and fair voting, despite the difficult conditions on the ground faced by their observers. The lackluster and silent monitoring of the 1995 Algerian presidential elections by the Arab League, Organization of African Unity and the United Nations enabled the authorities to boast of the international presence without any having to face thorough monitoring or public reporting by the observers.  This time, governments and multilateral institutions sending election observers must not forfeit the leverage for improvements that their presence offers. They should take steps to ensure that their observers are able to have access to potential sources of pertinent information regarding the free character of the polling, including restrictions on basic civil and political rights for all Algerians. They should ensure that their observers are able to speak publicly and promptly concerning conditions. If the observers travel with armed escorts from the security forces, assigned for their protection, they have a duty to weigh the deterrent effect this will have on ordinary citizens and party activists who might otherwise approach them with complaints about irregularities, and should identify means of enabling these potential sources to meet with them in private in order to provide them with information pertinent to the elections. If the armed security personnel are assigned against their express wishes, or if other obstacles are placed on their access or activities, observers should publicly state that such constraints can impugn the freedom and fairness of the elections themselves. In addition, foreign governments that maintain contact with representatives of the FIS should demand, as a condition of such relations, that the FIS take specific and visible steps to implement the above recommendations that are addressed to it.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria",""

The seizures of these individuals take place outside the law. As the Beirut Bar Association reported in April 1997: """"No existing legislation or bilateral treaty allows such conduct."""" Moreover, victims do not benefit from the protection of the law. There are no effective official government mechanisms -- in Lebanon or in Syria -- for families to learn of the whereabouts of their relatives and to seek legal remedy. Human Rights Watch has also obtained first-hand testimony indicating that Syrian intelligence forces have detained some Lebanese and held them incommunicado -- in Syrian detention facilities in Lebanon, and in Syria -- in order to pressure them to collaborate with Syrian intelligence in Lebanon.  Some 30,000 Syrian troops remain in Lebanon, as well as an undisclosed number of intelligence officers and other operatives. Syrian intelligence forces are known to maintain detention facilities in at least five locations inside Lebanon: in Tripoli in the north; in west Beirut at the headquarters of Syrian intelligence on Sadat Street, near the Beau Rivage Hotel in the Ramlet al-Baida neighborhood, an area also known as Beau Rivage; in Chtoura in the Beqaa' valley; and in Anjar, east of the Beirut-Damascus highway, near the Lebanese-Syria border. There is also a detention facility in Hazmiyeh, on the outskirts of Beirut, where a joint Syrian-Lebanese intelligence force reportedly is based. This report includes information about and testimony from Lebanese and stateless Palestinians who have been detained at these facilities.  For Lebanese Muslims and Christians alike, the phenomenon of """"disappearances"""" is one manifestation of what many of them view as de facto Syrian control -- or """"annexation"""" or """"occupation,"""" as they variously describe it -- of their country. Indeed, public discussion of """"disappearances"""" is largely taboo in Lebanon, and efforts to address the problem generally, or individual cases specifically, are not undertaken. Families of the """"disappeared"""" typically are afraid to come forward with information for fear of worsening the situation for their loved ones or putting themselves at risk of harassment or reprisal. They have been unable to secure assistance from Lebanese government officials or Lebanese nongovernmental organizations to obtain information about, access to, or the release of their relatives. Human Rights Watch wrote to Lebanese and Syrian government officials four times to express concern, to request information, and to recommend steps to remedy the problem of the continuing """"disappearances."""" These letters -- to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in October 1996 and March 1997, and to Syrian President Hafez al-Asad in November 1996 and March 1997 -- have gone unanswered, and persons continue to be detained and """"disappeared"""" on Lebanese soil. The Lebanese government clearly has ceded certain police powers to Syrian intelligence forces inside Lebanon -- in practice if not also by secret agreement. By providing an effective guarantee of impunity for human rights abuses under this arrangement, Lebanese authorities must bear a measure of direct responsibility for these abuses. Lebanese complicity in abuses by Syrian forces sometimes goes beyond official acquiescence and becomes direct collaboration with Syrian forces in carrying out reported """"disappearances."""" Among Human Rights Watch's recommedations are the following:  To the Government of Syria The Syrian government should apply the principles of transparency and accountability to address the problem of foreign nationals and stateless Palestinians who are detained in Syria, and to bring some measure of justice to victims and their families. Human Rights Watch urges the Syrian government to take the following actions:  Make public the names of all non-Syrians -- including Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians -- who are currently detained or imprisoned in Syria.  Individuals who are unlawfully detained should be immediately and unconditionally released. Syrian authorities should also investigate allegations that Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians have been tortured at Syrian detention facilities inside Lebanon, and should take steps to bring such practices to an immediate halt. Establish effective procedures for prompt response to inquiries from families, lawyers and nongovernmental organizations about the whereabouts of individuals who have been detained.  To the Government of Lebanon Initiatives by the Lebanese government are also required in order to hold Syrian security forces in Lebanon accountable for their actions. The following affirmative steps may help break the barrier of fear that has prevented families from coming forward when """"disappearances"""" occur, and has likewise discouraged lawyers from providing legal representation and independent nongovernmental organizations from undertaking advocacy on behalf of the victims:  Take firm and fully transparent measures to ensure that abuses at the hands of Syrian security forces in Lebanon come to an end.  Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and President Elias Hrawi should publicly declare that Syrian forces will not be permitted to operate with impunity on Lebanese soil, and should set forth the legal regime by which such forces are disciplined and held accountable for criminal offenses committed in Lebanon. Similarly, Lebanese government officials should convey to commanders of Lebanese military, intelligence and other security forces that their personnel must not participate in """"disappearances"""" in any manner. The government should further make clear that commanders who order or condone """"disappearances"""" will be held criminally responsible for these actions and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  To ensure that Lebanese military and security authorities in no manner participate in or facilitate """"disappearances,"""" the government should require that at the time of arrest or detention on Lebanese soil the arresting authorities identify themselves, and that all individuals taken into custody in Lebanon be held in publicly recognized places of detention, where accurate registers of detainees and prisoners are maintained and available for public inspection. Immediate steps should be taken to establish an independent legal office with full authority to investigate all cases of """"disappearances"""" in a prompt and transparent manner. This office should be empowered not only to determine the whereabouts of the """"disappeared,"""" but also to secure prompt access to these individuals for lawyers and family members. The creation of this office should be widely publicized in Lebanon, and its services should be made available to all residents of the country, including stateless Palestinians who are permanent residents.  To the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances The Working Group should investigate cases of enforced disappearance in Lebanon, and make demarches to Lebanese and Syrian authorities in order to determine the fate and whereabouts of the """"disappeared."""" Given the extraterritorial dimension of the practice of enforced disappearances in Lebanon, Human Rights Watch recommends that the Working Group analyze the issue in light of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and publicize its conclusions in relation to the implementation of the Declaration when there is such a dimension.  To the European Union and Member States Publicly acknowledge at a high level and condemn actions by Lebanese and Syrian authorities that result in the """"disappearances"""" of Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians. Raise with the Lebanese and Syrian governments at the highest levels, and as an urgent matter, the cases of Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians who have """"disappeared"""" at the hands of state agents, and impress upon both governments the need to respond positively to the recommendations in this report.  Instruct embassy staff in Damascus to raise and pursue specific cases of """"disappearances"""" with Syrian authorities and to seek access to detainees whose names are known.  Use all possible means, including linkage of aid and financial assistance to Syria, to obtain a full accounting by the Syrian government concerning persons detained and """"disappeared"""" by agents of the Syrian state, and on a public commitment by the government of Syria to cease such practices immediately.  To the Clinton Administration Publicly acknowledge at a high level and condemn actions by Lebanese and Syrian authorities that result in the """"disappearances"""" of Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians.  Raise with the Lebanese and Syrian governments at the highest levels, and as an urgent matter, the cases of Lebanese citizens and stateless Palestinians who have """"disappeared"""" at the hands of state agents, and impress upon both governments the need to respond positively to the recommendations in this report.  Instruct embassy staff in Damascus to raise and pursue specific cases of """"disappearances"""" with Syrian authorities and to seek access to detainees whose names are known.  In the context of the multilateral """"Friends of Lebanon"""" initiative, launched in 1996 to promote assistance to and investment in Lebanon, urge the government of Lebanon to implement the recommendations in this report, and publicly support such initiatives.","Middle East/North Africa, Lebanon, Syria",""

In To Serve Without Favor: Policing, Human Rights and Accountability, released today at a Belfast press conference, Human Rights Watch highlights four areas of policing that raise urgent human rights concern: the draconian police powers enjoyed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) under Northern Ireland's emergency regime, the policing of the summer 1996 marching season, the dramatic rise in paramilitary punishment assaults and expulsions, and the persistent allegations of collusion between members of the security forces and loyalist paramilitary groups. Human Rights Watch charges that the emergency legislation itself gives rise to substantial violations of human rights and urges its repeal. The government of the United Kingdom must recognize that emergency laws such as those in force in Northern Ireland often serve to sustain political violence by creating an environment in which individual human rights are routinely violated. To Serve Without Favor provides a detailed analysis of the human rights abuses committed during the marching season of 1996 in the hope that the poor policing that contributed to the violence will not be replicated in the approaching 1997 season. During the events of July 1996, policing failures and the lack of accountability for RUC misconduct contributed to a serious breakdown in the rule of law. Despite RUC claims of being caught in the middle of disputes between nationalists and unionists over the """"right to march,"""" a series of police actions -- sanctioned by the government -- exacerbated the conflict. These actions resulted in the effective submission of state authorities to the threat of unionist violence and included excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators, the indiscriminate use of plastic bullets against both unionist and nationalist protesters, and a general failure to halt illegal activities such as the blockade of the airport and the establishment of illegal roadblocks. The police have long concentrated their efforts on the suppression of political violence, and the anti-terrorist campaign has been waged to the exclusion of traditional police functions in some areas. Paramilitary organizations on both sides have assumed a quasi-policing role and Human Rights Watch has confirmed that in many communities in Northern Ireland normal policing functions have been abandoned. As a result, the brutality of paramilitary punishment beatings and assaults are a plague for both the nationalist and unionist communities on a daily basis. Paramilitary volunteers mete out """"punishments"""" on members of their own communities for perceived or actual offenses, such as drug trafficking, burglary, assault, wife abuse, glue sniffing, public intoxication, joyriding and other """"anti-social"""" activities. Paramilitary punishments take a variety of forms, including murders, crippling shootings, brutal beatings and """"expulsion orders"""" that force an alleged perpetrator to leave a particular city or all of Northern Ireland for a designated period. In the absence of normal policing, paramilitary organizations act as investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury, and they carry out their own sentences. Finally, Human Rights Watch addresses the persistent allegations of collusion between members of the security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitary groups. Security forces allegedly engage in such collusion by conspiring directly with loyalist paramilitaries to carry out acts of violence or by facilitating the commission of violent loyalist paramilitary activities. Those who allege collusion charge that members of the security forces assist loyalist paramilitaries to target suspected republican """"terrorists"""" for harassment and assassination. In addition to allegations of direct involvement in the planning and execution of assassinations, security forces have been accused of failing to provide adequate protection to those threatened by the paramilitaries, and failing to rigorously investigate loyalist paramilitary killings by overlooking critical and easily accessible forensic evidence. Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned with allegations of collusion against the police force in Northern Ireland. Collusion, by definition, is difficult to prove, and Human Rights Watch reaches no conclusions regarding the evidence of collusion by the RUC in any of the cases mentioned in this report. We do, however, call for a variety of immediate official responses to determine whether collusion has occurred. The recent change of government in the United Kingdom may open a new chapter in Northern Ireland's troubled history. The new government has promised a number of new initiatives to build confidence throughout Northern Ireland, including the expansion of individual rights and the reform of policing. In response to that pledge, Human Rights Watch offers a detailed set of recommendations to the government of the United Kingdom: The Emergency Regime  The emergency regime in Northern Ireland should be dismantled, beginning immediately, with the repeal of provisions of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions Act) 1996 (EPA) and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (PTA) that unduly infringe civil liberties and are used by the police to harass and intimidate people. A """"reasonable suspicion"""" of criminal activity should be required for the police to exercise the powers to stop, question and search people. The U.K. government should take immediate steps to end random street stops and searches and to ensure that all searches are conducted without degrading or harassing measures. The EPA's search and entry powers should be repealed. A judicial warrant should be required for house searches and for examining or seizing documents.  The U.K. government should withdraw its derogation to article 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights which allows the police to detain persons arrested under the emergency legislation for up to seven days without charge.  Detainees should be brought before a court within at least forty-eight hours of arrest.  Castlereagh Holding Centre should be closed immediately in compliance with the recommendations of the U.N. Human Rights Committee and the U.N. Committee Against Torture. These U.N. bodies and the U.K.-appointed Independent Commissioner for the Holding Centres have found the conditions of detention in Castlereagh """"unacceptable"""" due to tiny cells with no natural light, the absence of exercise areas, lengthy and frequent interrogations, and persistent allegations of intimidation and harassment during interrogations. The U.K. should immediately take the following steps to comply with the 1996 decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Murray v. United Kingdom which held that the abrogation of the right to silence in combination with restrictions on access to counsel amount to a violation of the fair trial provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR): 1) The Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, which permits a court to draw adverse inferences from a suspect's refusal to answer questions asked by police during interrogations and at trial, should be rescinded as an unjustified infringement of the privilege against self-incrimination. 2) Detainees should have prompt and regular access to counsel of their choice and detainees should be allowed to have their lawyers present during interrogations.  The Independent Commissioner for the Holding Centres' (ICHC) proposal for the establishment of a legal advice unit at holding centers, which would modify the present legal aid system in Northern Ireland by granting legal aid only to those detainees arrested under the emergency legislation who choose a government-appointed solicitor from a unit of lawyers associated with the holding centers, should be rejected. Detainees should have prompt access to a lawyer of their choice.  Detainees should be able to notify family members or friends immediately following arrest.  The RUC should take immediate effective measures to prevent the physical and psychological ill-treatment of detainees. Officers who carry out such abuses should be disciplined and criminally prosecuted. All interrogations should be audio and video taped. Detainees' attorneys should have access to all audio and video tapes of interrogations.  The permissive EPA standard for admitting at trial confession evidence procured by psychological pressure, deprivation, or other non-violent forms of coercion should be abolished. The standard for admitting confession evidence should conform to the ordinary criminal law, the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (PACE), which excludes confession evidence that was obtained by oppression or """"in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made. . . in consequence thereof.""""  The juryless Diplock courts, established to try political violence cases, have caused a loss of confidence in the justice system and should be abolished. The common law right to trial by jury should be restored in Northern Ireland involving, if necessary, measures to protect jurors. Police Accountability The current tripartite structure responsible for policing in Northern Ireland involving the inter-relationship of the U.K. government, the RUC, and the civilian oversight Police Authority for Northern Ireland should be reformed to provide for greater public accountability for the RUC. The Police Authority, in practice excluded from participation in the determination of policies related to security policing and the operational aspects of policing in Northern Ireland, should be consulted on security and operational matters and its recommendations taken into consideration.  The U.K. government should establish an independent unit to investigate complaints against police officers as recommended by Dr. Maurice Hayes, independent reviewer of the police-complaints system appointed by the U.K. government.  All RUC officers should be required to take instruction in basic human rights guarantees which the force is obliged to respect in compliance with the U.K.'s international obligations, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), the Convention Against Torture (CAT), the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), and international codes of conduct for law enforcement officials and the use of firearms.  Composition of the RUC Progressive measures should commence immediately to rectify the religious imbalance in the RUC. RUC management should develop a strategy for attracting and securing positions on the force for qualified Catholic applicants. The Police Authority for Northern Ireland should be consulted in this process and its recommendations taken into consideration.  Policing Parades and Marches An independent body should make determinations concerning conditions on marches and parades.  Decisions taken by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland to ban marches should be judicially reviewable.  The police should take measures to ensure that the right to peaceful assembly is protected to the greatest possible extent. Assemblies that pose a threat of violence should be restricted only to the extent necessary in a democratic society in the interest of public safety.  The police should take measures to ensure that the rights to freedom of movement and privacy in the communities through which marches pass are protected. If restrictions on movement are required, they should be proportionate to the interest advanced by state authorities.  The use of plastic bullets should be banned because they have killed fourteen people in Northern Ireland, including seven children, and severely injured hundreds of others. Alternative methods of crowd control should be developed and employed.  Lethal force should be used in Northern Ireland only when necessary to meet an imminent threat to life and only in proportion to the actual danger presented in conformity with international standards.  Police should be adequately trained to defuse tense situations non-violently. Policing of marches and parades should be conducted impartially and professionally. Officers should not use sectarian language in the course of any police operation. Disciplinary measures should be taken against those who violate these principles.  The death of Dermot McShane, who was killed after a British army armored personnel carrier ran over him under suspicious circumstances during the summer of 1996 disturbances, should be investigated in conformity with the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. Punishment Shootings, Assaults, and Expulsions  The IRA and loyalist paramilitary organizations should immediately halt punishment shootings, beatings, and expulsions.  The RUC should perform normal policing functions in all areas of Northern Ireland. The U.K. government should provide adequate training, resources and protection for police officers carrying out such duties.  Political parties in Northern Ireland should not support the creation of alternative """"justice"""" systems in communities. Allegations of Collusion The police force should be vetted thoroughly to identify and exclude recruits, officers, and reservists with illicit connections to paramilitary groups.  Procedures for the handling of security information should be reassessed with a view to eliminating security breaches such as the leaking of photo montages.  Measures should be taken by the U.K. government to afford persons under threat from paramilitary organizations the greatest possible protection, including the approval of home security grants.  In areas where paramilitary killings have occurred or killings have been threatened, security measures should be implemented on routes into and out of those communities to ensure that they receive adequate protection from incursions by paramilitaries.  The RUC should rigorously investigate paramilitary killings, including by using good forensic practices.  Allegations that detectives conducting interrogations threaten to pass a detainee's security information to paramilitary organizations should be investigated rigorously. Officers found guilty of such an abuse should be punished.  Special efforts should be made to protect lawyers who represent suspects charged under the emergency legislation from interference, harassment, intimidation, or death threats from RUC detectives. Allegations of intimidation of defense lawyers should be investigated, and offending officers should be punished.  An independent, public inquiry into the killing of Catholic criminal defense lawyer Patrick Finucane, with powers to administer oaths and to subpoena witnesses, should be convened.  The U.K. government should permit the discovery of information relevant to the murder of Patrick Finucane for use in Geraldine Finucane's civil action and application to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).  The RUC should investigate the murder of Patrick Shanaghan, who suffered years of official harassment and threats before being killed by loyalist paramilitaries, in compliance with the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.  The complaints of Patrick Shanaghan's mother, Mary Shanaghan, to the Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC) should be investigated rigorously and appropriate action should be taken against any officers found to have acted in violation of RUC policy or of British law. The Coroners' Law and Rules for Northern Ireland should, at a minimum, be brought in line with the law and rules for England and Wales: Coroner's juries should have the power to reach a full verdict, such as """"unlawful killing by unnamed person(s)."""" Persons suspected of causing the death at issue should be compelled to testify in person, but should not be required to answer questions that might incriminate them. Families of victims and their attorneys should have access to all the evidence to be introduced at an inquest and adequate time to prepare for their interventions.","Europe/Central Asia, United Kingdom",""

The ADFL is now in a position to end the abuses that occurred under President Mobutu Sese Seko and must be careful to avoid mirroring the government it deposed. establishing the army and the national gendarmerie as non-partisan and nationally-representative forces under civilian control; establishing basic political freedoms, including freedom of speech, particularly making public radio and television available to all points of view; and reforming the regional and local administrations into non-partisan and nationally-representative institutions. Human Rights Watch/Africa also expressed its concern at reported statements by official spokesmen of the ADFL that seemed to indicate the Alliance's intention to ban political parties and to propagate its own brand of political and civic education including through mandatory attendance at ideological seminars for selective sectors of the population. If carried out, such measures would effectively deny the role of civil opposition in challenging the abusive rule of the Mobutu era and the significant contributions of the dynamic and vibrant civil society organizations in promoting democratic culture in the country. Of further concern are reports of abduction of Rwandan soldiers from a hospital in Kinshasa where they were under treatment and of incidents of summary executions of soldiers of the deposed government who had surrendered to the ADFL. Human Rights Watch/Africa called on the ADFL to take immediate action to halt such practices, and to investigate and punish those responsible for these and similar incidents.  Human Rights Watch/Africa welcomes as long overdue calls by members of the international community for an inclusive and accountable government in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The international community should press for scrupulous investigations of allegations of civilian massacres in the context of the armed conflict and should make any commitment of aid to the new government dependent on concrete steps toward respecting human rights and creating conditions for free and fair elections. RECOMMENDATIONS: To the new Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo: The ADFL and other opposition forces should pledge that upon forming a government they will:  respect and represent the interests of a pluralistic society, and allow its citizens to freely elect their representatives; abide by the international human rights instruments to which Zaire was party and ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions; support as an urgent priority the development of an independent judiciary; ensure that anyone detained is brought promptly before a judicial authority after arrest; ensure that no one will be detained without being charged with a recognizable criminal offence and without being brought promptly to trial before an independent court; implement programs to train law enforcement agents and the military about human rights standards and protection while instituting procedures through which violations of human rights are the subject of effective investigation and criminal prosecution; repudiate arbitrary measures to strip Kinyarwanda-speaking nationals the Banyarwanda or other minorities of their Zairian nationality. Citizenship must not be revoked on ethnic or other discriminatory grounds; investigate and facilitate independent investigations of violations of human rights or humanitarian law by forces of the deposed government as well as members of the ADFL forces with a view to public disclosure of the findings and accountability before the law of those responsible for gross abuses; take immediate steps to create conditions conducive to free and fair elections, such as ensuring civilian control over the military and the national gendarmerie, rendering the regional and local administration non-partisan and nationally representative, and affirming the respect of basic political freedoms including freedom of expression, association and assembly;  encourage the independent work of local and national civic organizations, including nongovernmental organizations dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights, and remove legal or administrative obstacles to this work; encourage the full exercise of internationally recognized standards of free expression by Zaire's print, broadcast and other media; take all measures conducive to the widest participation by all Zairians in the political life of their country.  abide by the binding norms of international humanitarian law applicable to situations of armed conflict, and in particular: ensure humane treatment for all persons detained or otherwise hors de combat in connection with the conflict; torture and extrajudicial execution should never be tolerated; permit and facilitate access by relief assistance programs to war-affected populations and refugees so that they may receive food, medicine, and other relief. Relief assistance programs of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other agencies should be allowed to proceed in accordance with humanitarian need and their respective missions, without hindrance. Provide safe land, river and air access for the provision of humanitarian aid; permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit persons detained in connection with the conflict;  prohibit the recruitment and use of child soldiers and to facilitate the demobilization, rehabilitation and return to society of such children; cooperate with measures undertaken by the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and international humanitarian and human rights organizations to monitor, investigate and provide remedies for human rights and humanitarian emergencies in the Democratic Republic of Congo; To all Members of the International Community, including the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, and the Organization of African Unity:  call upon the new government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to permit full, unhampered international investigations of the allegations of widespread civilian massacres during the armed conflict that led to its establishment; pressure the government to investigate reports of such attacks, to make the findings public, and to bring to justice those responsible; make any commitment of aid to the new government, including election assistance, dependent on concrete steps toward respecting human rights and creating the conditions for free and fair elections, including: reforming the army and the national gendarmerie as non-partisan and nationally-representative forces under civilian control; establishing basic political freedoms, including freedom of speech, particularly making public radio and television available to all points of view; and reforming the regional and local administrations into non-partisan and nationally-representative institutions. Monitor closely and make public reports regarding the actual progress toward implementation of programs to prepare for elections; Support programs by organizations of civil society in Zaire to promote respect for human rights, propagate a democratic culture, and train independent election monitors.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

A copy of the letter is attached. May 23, 1997 President Yasir Arafat Palestinian Authority Gaza City, Gaza Strip via facsimile: 972-7-822-365 Your Excellency: We are writing to protest the continuing detention without charge of Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian-American journalist and television producer. According to press accounts and persons who have spoken with Mr. Kuttab, he is apparently being held in connection with his televised broadcasts of open sessions of the Palestinian Legislative Council. We urge you to release him immediately. This incident follows a disturbing pattern of harassment by the Palestinian Authority of journalists, human rights monitors, and other government critics, a number of whom have been detained solely for exercising their internationally guaranteed right to free expression. Mr. Kuttab was summoned by the authorities following his distribution, to local Palestinian television stations, of a tape of the session that day of the Palestine Legislative Council, which reportedly included critical discussion of the fiscal policies of the Authority. According to our information, Mr. Kuttab's company, Al-Quds Educational Television, has written authorization from the Ministry of Communications of the Palestinian Authority, as well as approval from the Palestinian Security Service, to broadcast the sessions of the Council.  At 11 pm on Tuesday, May 20, Mr. Kuttab was summoned without a warrant to the Ramallah police station. Colonel Firas, the chief of police, allowed Mr. Kuttab to telephone his brother Jonathan to inform him of his arrest at 2:30 am. Later that morning, however, Col. Firas claimed that Mr. Kuttab had been questioned for only fifteen minutes and then released. Later that afternoon, in response to queries from the international press as well as several ministers in your government and the United States Consulate, the authorities acknowledged that Mr. Kuttab was still in custody. At that time the authorities reportedly told Jonathan Kuttab that they would not interrogate Daoud or bring charges until Your Excellency had returned from Cairo.  Attorney General Khaled Al-Qidrah told Agence France-Presse today, May 23, that he is investigating Mr. Kuttab for """"violating journalism regulations,"""" and asserted that he would be brought to trial if evidence is found. While we do not know the basis of such """"violations,"""" we cannot accept that they provide a legitimate basis for detaining Mr. Kuttab or any other journalist. Since this morning, Mr. Kuttab has been denied visits by members of his family and US Consular officials, apparently at the explicit orders of your office in Gaza. According to family members, the police insisted that only Your Excellency could reverse the detention order, and that they had received instructions that no one could visit Mr. Kuttab without authorization from your office. Persons who attempted to visit Mr. Kuttab today told Human Rights Watch that Mr. Kuttab had signaled them that he had initiated or was about to initiate a hunger strike to protest his illegal detention.  Human Rights Watch strongly urges you to order Mr. Kuttab's immediate release. We also urge you to instruct the security forces and other law enforcement officials under your authority to cease all activities such as this which appear intended to intimidate Palestinian journalists and media workers from exercising their right to free expression and to interfere with the right of Palestinian citizens to information that allows them to participate meaningfully in public life and political affairs.

The letter comes in advance of a May 26 hearing in the Beirut Court of Appeals in which Lebanese government prosecutors will appeal an earlier decision in Dr. Mugraby's favor. Human Rights Watch fears a reversal could have """"grave implications for the right to counsel and the freedom to report rights abuses in Lebanon."""" A copy of the letter follows. His Excellency Rafiq al-Hariri Prime Minister of Lebanon c/o His Excellency Victor El-Zmeter Deputy Chief of Mission Embassy of Lebanon 2560 28th Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20008 May 22, 1997 via facsimile: 202-939-6324 Your Excellency: In a case with potentially grave implications for the right to counsel and the freedom to report rights abuses in Lebanon, the Beirut Court of Appeals will hear on May 26 three cases brought by the Lebanese government against a prominent Beirut lawyer, Dr. Muhamad Mugraby. Dr. Mugraby faces prosecution for actions and statements directly related to his role as a defense attorney. This prosecution continues despite the refusal by the Council of the Beirut Bar to waive his immunity from prosecution. The hearing is of special concern because it involves actions which Dr. Mugraby has taken on behalf of clients subject to legal proceedings instituted by their government: The first case began after the government intercepted a fax letter dated September 24, 1994, from Dr. Mugraby to Amnesty International in London. In it, Dr. Mugraby complained of substantive and procedural irregularities in military court trials in which he served as defendants' counsel. The Ministry of Defense alleged that the letter defamed the Lebanese government, its security services, and its courts, and asked the Prosecutor General to begin legal proceedings against Dr. Mugraby. The government has stated that it intends to prosecute Dr. Mugraby for filing false complaints with a judicial authority, despite the fact that Amnesty International is not such an authority. It also wishes to bring a libel charge even though Lebanese law does not permit such an action in connection with the exercise of a public authority. The second case involves Dr. Mugraby's legal arguments during a client's military trial for contacts with Israel. On July 9, 1994, Dr. Mugraby argued that in the absence of a formal, legal determination that Israel is an """"enemy"""" of Lebanon, his client could not be convicted under a provision of the Penal Code barring contacts with enemy soldiers or agents. Subsequently, Dr. Mugraby refused to comply with a summons issued by an assistant military prosecutor to appear before that prosecutor for questioning as to the substance of the legal motion on the grounds that the assistant prosecutor lacked the authority under law to issue such a summons, and the issue was referred to the Prosecutor General who to date has not specified the specific charges against Dr. Mugraby. The third suit against Dr. Mugraby stems from a legal dispute over land in the old city of Beirut in which he is defending the original property-owners against Solidere, a government-organized and now privately owned real estate development company in which you own a large share. The government brought charges against Dr. Mugraby's clients after they demolished a make-shift wall built by Solidere workers inside their building. The government is attempting to prosecute Dr. Mugraby as well for allegedly ordering the demolition of the wall. The factual basis of this charge is Dr. Mugraby's opinion given to his clients that the wall had been built there illegally. In this case as well, the Prosecutor General has not specified the provisions of law under which it wishes to charge Dr. Mugraby. In all three cases, the Council of the Beirut Bar, of which Dr. Mugraby is a member, rejected the Prosecutor General's request that the council waive Dr. Mugraby's immunity from prosecution. Under Lebanese law, no criminal action against a lawyer may proceed unless the Council waives his or her immunity, and this immunity may not be waived in cases involving actions directly related to the defendant's role as an attorney. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Lebanon acceded in 1972, guarantees the right to counsel in criminal cases. This right is meaningless if lawyers may not defend their clients zealously within the limits prescribed by law. For this reason, the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1990, calls on governments to ensure that lawyers """"are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment, or improper interference"""" and that they """"shall not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution . . . for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics."""" Furthermore, should the government continue its prosecution of the published libel charges, it will do so in violation of Dr. Mugraby's right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 19 of the ICCPR. To insist that Dr. Mugraby's letter to Amnesty International complaining of the treatment of his client constitutes defamation of some of the leading institutions of the Lebanese government is to cast a long and intimidating shadow over others who might think of reporting human rights violations to international organizations. Given Dr. Mugraby's prominent role in defense of human rights in Lebanon and his actions on behalf of dozens of persons adversely affected by Solidere, Human Rights Watch fears that these prosecutions are designed to intimidate and harass Dr. Mugraby for actions that fall squarely within his rights, and indeed constitute his duties, as a rights advocate. As further evidence of the arbitrary nature of the prosecution, none of the three complaints before the Council of the Beirut Bar specified the charges the Prosecutor General intended to bring against Dr. Mugraby. Even if these legal proceedings ultimately fail, Human Rights Watch will regard with concern the chilling effect that this case will have on lawyers and activists less prominent and well-established than Dr. Mugraby who are or may be engaged in the defense of individuals against government prosecution and rights abuses. For these reasons, Human Rights Watch respectfully calls on the Beirut Court of Appeals to uphold the Council of the Beirut Bar's decision to preserve Dr. Mugraby's immunity from prosecution for actions and statements on behalf of his clients. Human Rights Watch also calls on the Lebanese government to drop its case against Dr. Mugraby and to refrain from prosecuting persons reporting human rights abuses under the false complaints and published libel provisions of its Penal Code. In the meantime, we intend to follow closely Dr. Mugraby's case and the outcome of the government's appeal.

At the same time, the human rights organization criticized the European Union for granting Yugoslavia preferential trade status last month while these abuses were taking place. The 18 ethnic Albanians are part of approximately 100 people arrested at the end of January 1997 after a spate of terrorist attacks in Kosovo (55 are facing criminal charges). Lawyers for the defendants told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki that at times they were denied access to their clients for as many as eight days and that most of their clients had been severely beaten while in detention. Some confessed after being tortured. The defendants are accused of committing terrorist acts (Article 125 of the Serbian Criminal Code) and membership in a hostile organization (Art.136, paragraph 1) -- The National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo, a clandestine organization that calls for the secession of Kosovo from Yugoslavia by violent means. Another group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has taken credit for killing a number of Serbian officials and policemen since February 1996, as well as two ethnic Albanians they accused of collaborating with the Serbian government. After a number of the attacks the police conducted wide-scale arbitrary arrests in the area of the attack, often beating those they had taken into detention. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki respects the right of the Serb authorities to investigate and prosecute those suspected of having organized or committed terrorist acts. But such investigations must conform to domestic and international human rights guarantees. In this case, there is ample evidence that both Serbian and international law have been violated, most egregiously with the use of torture. In April, while these abuses were taking place, the European Union granted Yugoslavia preferential trade status. Such concessions to President Milosevic demonstrate the international community's indifference to human rights violations, and remove any leverage the international community has to improve human rights conditions in Yugoslavia. """"Incidents of torture and political trials after the agreement with the EU are evidence that the policy of positive encouragement has not stopped Serbian President Slobodon Milosevic from committing abuses,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki sees the political trials in Kosovo as a continuation of the Serbian government's oppression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Trials like these, police abuse and discrimination in education and health care have been part of a state policy to repress ethnic Albanians and encourage their emigration from the region since 1989.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Dr. al-Ahwany has been held in a Cairo prison without a hearing since April 24, 1997, when he was arrested for photocopying a paper critical of a controversial provision of an Egyptian agrarian reform law. Human Rights Watch and the Committee also express their concern that al-Ahwany's detention will have a """"deleterious and chilling effect on the exercise by other citizens of their fundamental right to seek information and to freedom of expression."""" A copy of the letter follows. May 15, 1997 His Excellency Hosni Mubarak President of the Arab Republic of Egypt c/o His Excellency Ahmed Maher El Sayed Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt 3521 International Court, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20008 Your Excellency: We write on behalf of Human Rights Watch and the Committee for International Academic Freedom to express our grave concern over the recent arrest and continued detention, now entering its fourth week, of Cairo University professor Ahmed al-Ahwany. Dr. al-Ahwany, assistant professor of chemical engineering at the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University and a prominent and active member of Cairo University Staff Members Club, the Egyptian Engineers Syndicate, and various Egyptian human rights organizations, was arrested by State Security Investigation (""""SSI"""") on April 24, 1997. Dr. al-Ahwany was arrested when he arrived at a bookstore/photocopying center, located off Giza Square close to Cairo University, to pick up a photocopy order he had placed earlier that day. The documents he wished to have copied included a paper criticizing a provision of a controversial Egyptian agrarian law, due to take affect in October of this year, which allows landowners to remove long-term tenant farmers from the land. For possessing and attempting to make copies of this paper, Dr. al-Ahwany has been accused by the State Security Prosecutor's Office with having violated article 102 bis of the Egyptian penal code, a law which prohibits the dissemination of """"false or biased news, statements or rumors"""" and the distribution of """"inciteful propaganda"""" with intent to endanger public security or public welfare. Among the lines of questioning put to Dr. al-Ahwany by prosecutors after his arrest was a series of inquiries concerning his opinions about the agrarian law and about the critical stance toward the law adopted in the paper in his possession. Dr. al-Ahwany currently is being held in Mazra'at Tora prison in Cairo under provisions of Egyptian penal law which allow the State Security Prosecutor's Office to have a suspect held in preventive detention for up to 45 days before review by a magistrate. Dr. al-Ahwany originally was held under a 15-daydetention order which was renewed on May 6 for another 15 days by deputy State Security Prosecutor Walid el-Guindy. Dr. al-Ahwany's case has not yet been brought before a magistrate. Dr. al-Ahwany's detention constitutes a clearviolation of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (""""ICCPR""""), ratified by Egypt on January 14, 1982, which guarantees all individuals the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds. This fundamental guarantee is directly contravened where, as here, an individual is imprisoned merely for having in his possession and making copies of a paper critical of government policy. Although Article 19 of the ICCPR allows for certain restrictions on freedom of information on grounds of national security, the terms of any such restriction must be specific and narrowly tailored to prevent against arbitrariness and to ensure that the internationally recognized human rights of all individuals are protected. The detention of Dr. al-Ahwany and the threat of further penal sanctions against him under the vague provisions of Article 102 bis of the Egyptian penal code constitute precisely such an arbitrary restriction on Dr. al-Ahwany's rights under Article 19 of the ICCPR. The questions put to Dr. al-Ahwany after his arrest concerning his views on the agrarian law, moreover, suggest an intent to harass and intimidate him for the opinions he holds, an action which violates the absolute guarantee of freedom of opinion enshrined in the first sentence of Article 19 of the ICCPR. Finally, we believe that, even if the prosecution decides not to pursue the case against Dr. al-Ahwany or if the matter eventually is dismissed by a magistrate, his detention for up to 45 days will have a deleterious and chilling effect on the exercise by other citizens of their fundamental right to seek information and to freedom of expression. The Committee on International Academic Freedom is particularly concerned with the adverse consequences for academic freedom and scholarship. A university cannot fulfill its paramount role in fostering free inquiry, rational discourse and open exchange of ideas where professors must live in fear that they will be imprisoned on grounds such as those under which Dr. al-Ahwany currently is being held. We urge the government of Egypt to desist from applying its laws to imprison persons for the possession and reproduction of written materials and, in the absence of evidence establishing that Dr. al-Ahwany actually was involved in inciting violence, we call on the government to release Dr. al-Ahwany immediately and unconditionally.

Human Rights Watch/Asia is a division of Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organization that monitors and reports on human rights conditions around the globe and maintains an office in Hong Kong. We welcome the opportunity to comment on these issues of critical importance to Hong Kong's future.   Our principal concern is that the amendments proposed introduce restrictions on the rights of free assembly and association inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The working assumption of the Consultation Document appears to be that Hong Kong will become a much more volatile and dangerous place after June 30, 1997 and will thus need more stringent regulation of demonstrations and societies. This seems, however, an unnecessarily gloomy view that is unsupported by facts. The present ordinances, some recently revised to conform to this international standard, have so far proven entirely adequate to secure public order and prevent genuine threats to China's national security, and no reasons have been offered as to why they would suddenly be inadequate after the transition. Moreover, the language of the proposed amendments is so vague in parts that it would sow confusion as to when the law was violated, and thus inhibit people in Hong Kong from exercising these basic rights. In some aspects, there is a danger is that the proposed amendments would produce worse consequences for human rights than merely reinstating the original colonial-era laws. These concerns, and other points, are elaborated below.   The challenge of ensuring fundamental civil and political freedoms in Hong Kong while addressing public order and national security interests is a difficult one and entails a careful analysis of the interlocking requirements of Hong Kong's laws, both domestic and international. This first legislative reform proposed by your administration will have profound implications for the type of society Hong Kong becomes as a Special Administrative Region of China, and it therefore deserves careful, not rushed consideration. We therefore recommend that you urge the government of the People's Republic of China to leave in place the current laws until such time as a decision, fully researched and fully consultative, can be made as to whether they require amendment, and if so, how to amend them so as to fully uphold international human rights in Hong Kong. Legislation of such importance should be debated and voted on not by a provisional legislature, but by an elected legislature of the SAR, to uphold the people of Hong Kong's right under ICCPR Article 25 to take part in the conduct of public affairs directly or through freely chosen representatives.   General Principles of Protection Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  The Consultation Document states that all future legislation in Hong Kong must be consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (para. 2.7), an important recognition of Hong Kong and China's legal obligations under the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, respectively. The Covenant, in turn, tolerates restrictions on the freedoms of assembly and association only where three conditions are met: i) that the restriction is """"necessary in a democratic society""""; ii) that it is in conformity with or prescribed by law and iii) that it is imposed in the interests of one of the following -- """"national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""""  The Consultation Document justifies new restrictions by reference to the need to redraw the """"balance"""" between individual liberties, on the one hand, and security and order concerns, on the other (3.7, 5.4). Yet international human rights law requires not that rights be weighed against state interests but that rights be subject only to restriction in carefully defined circumstances. As the European Court of Human Rights commented, assessing the legitimacy of a restriction is not """"a choice between two conflicting principles but with a [rights] principle...that is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted."""" (1)  The Consultation Document recognizes that """"Hong Kong has enjoyed remarkable social stability"""" (3.4), that """"people of Hong Kong have exercised their rights and freedoms in a sensible and responsible manner"""" and that they are """"remarkably accommodating of different viewpoints"""" and """"tolerant of occasional aberrations from what is widely regarded as acceptable social behavior"""" (3.2). The question immediately arises whether restriction of the right to demonstrate or to form societies is """"necessary"""" in the democratic society of Hong Kong.   The requirement that restrictions be """"necessary"""" imposes an affirmative obligation on the imposing government to show that they indeed are; a simple assertion that there may be some unspecified risk to national security or public order would not meet the threshold contemplated by the Covenant. To be """"necessary,"""" a restriction must be narrowly tailored and proportional to the danger to a protected interest. A typical way of phrasing this principle in U.S. jurisprudence is that the limitation on rights be the least restrictive means of protecting a valid interest. In additional to being proportional, to be necessary """"in a democratic society"""" requires the restriction to be compatible with values of pluralism, tolerance, broad-mindedness and popular sovereignty.   We are concerned, therefore, that the Consultation Document does not justify the restrictions it proposes, apart from asserting that """"it is easy to forget that being a small and open economy, Hong Kong is extremely vulnerable to external forces,"""" and the government must """"ensure that there are sufficient safeguards in our system to maintain law and order at all times, and to react to unforeseen circumstances swiftly and effectively"""" (3.4). The statement that the """"protection of human rights must not be compromised"""" is a strong positive commitment; it is incompatible, however, to justify new restrictions on rights by merely asserting """"nor should social stability be put to unnecessary risk"""" without any showing that there are new risks that require new measures (3.8b).   4. It is not sufficient for a restriction on rights to be written into an ordinance for it to be """"in conformity with law"""" or """"prescribed by law"""" under the Covenant. A restriction must be framed with enough specificity to give notice of what is lawful and what is unlawful action and(2) otherwise comport with applicable human rights guarantees. The proposed amendments, as many have pointed out, rest on vague and undefined terms that would cast a pall over the exercise of basic rights. Likewise, merely reproducing in the statutory language the Covenant's list of valid state interests does not alone make such restrictions """"lawful."""" The language of the Covenant is purposefully general, in recognition that domestic restrictions on rights must be precisely tailored in order to apply only where """"necessary"""" in a """"democratic"""" society. Nor can restrictions on assembly and association be deemed """"lawful"""" without consideration of their impact on other rights, such as free expression or the right to organize labor unions.   5. A statement of April 21 intended to clarify terms in the Consultation Document (the Clarification) explains that the purpose of some restrictions is """"to prevent foreign political forces from making use of Hong Kong to conduct political activities targeted at China and to prevent political organisations in Hong Kong from being controlled by foreign powers"""" . (3)These purposes are embraced by the protection of """"national security,"""" a term used throughout the proposed amendments, whose interpretation """"must be consistent with the UN definition"""" (3Ab). However, the Clarification states that the term """"covers any activity prejudicial to the very existence of the State,"""" and claims the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relates the term to """"measures enacted with a view to safeguarding territorial integrity and national independence from any external threat."""" This explanation, taken out of context from the report of a U.N. Special Rapporteur, does not support a broad reading of the national security exception. To begin with, the Universal Declaration does not mention the term """"national security,"""" and indeed, in no way qualifies the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association contained in Article 20. """"National security,"""" as used in the ICCPR, denotes serious cases of political or military threat to the entire nation, not merely any act """"prejudicial"""" or """"threatening;"""" the serious threat must be to the nation as a whole, not merely to a locality or to a particular party or government.The plain meaning of the terms must be accorded substantial weight since the travaux préparatoires fail to elaborate on the content of national security. """"National"""" indicates that the anticipated danger must relate to the country as a whole. (....) A state may be said to be secure only when all of its constituent elements, its territory, its inhabitants, and its government, are secure. Security in regard to the inhabitants consists of the inviolability of their human rights. In a state where security to inhabitants is completely lacking, state security cannot be said to exist. Such a government cannot justify limitations on rights to protect national security when, in fact, there is no security to protect, but only the government's interest in self-preservation.   6. Likewise, criticism or protests against the government, or peaceful but controversial expression on subjects relevant to national security do not of themselves constitute threats to """"public order."""" For example, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ruled the police violated a protester's fundamental rights when they beat him in the course of a protest against the government, writing """"Stifling the peaceful expression of legitimate dissent today can only result, inexorably, in the catastrophic explosion of violence some other day."""" (5)In U.S. law, restrictions on expression are justifiable only when the expression intended to incite imminent lawless action and likely to do so. (6)   Freedom of Assembly and the Public Order Ordinance   7. The basic change proposed in the Consultation Document to the Public Order Ordinance is replacing the present notification system with one where the Commissioner of Police would in effect license public meetings and processions (5.5-5.8 and annex). In particular, the Commissioner would have to be notified seven days before a public procession, or not less than forty-eight hours in exceptional circumstances, and then must communicate to the organizers either a """"Notice of No Objection"""" or a """"Notice of Objection"""" stating reasons or conditions no later than forty-eight hours before the scheduled march. Appeals from these decisions are to go to an administrative board chaired by a retired judge that would presumably be appointed by the Chief Executive or his delegate.   8. The issue of whether a system of prior licensing of assemblies ever comports with the ICCPR is subject to debate; however, even in jurisdictions that require licensing, such as the United States, discretion to withhold or condition licenses is strictly limited and subject to immediate judicial appeal. In the U.S., for example, restrictions must be limited to the time, place or manner of a demonstration, with regard to public order considerations. The police may schedule demonstrations to avoid traffic jams or rush hour, or cordon off particular areas for fire safety reasons. They may not, however, deny licenses on the basis of the ideology or message of the demonstrators, however objectionable or likely to cause a hostile response from an audience.(7)   9. In contrast, the Police Commissioner would be empowered under the proposed amendments to deny permission to demonstrate if """"he reasonably considers the holding of the procession is not in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedom of others."""" These conditions, though cribbed from the language of the ICCPR, present problems.   10. To begin with, the ICCPR requires that a restriction be """"necessary in a democratic society"""" and not merely in the interests of national security and so on. As discussed earlier, this requires a careful consideration of proportionality, and a guarantee that any restriction places the least possible burden on exercise of the right.   11. Moreover, permitting the Police Commissioner to quash assemblies of more than thirty persons in the name of """"national security"""" invites abuse. Would the peaceful demonstrations to commemorate the June 4, 1989 killings in Beijing be banned or restricted on the basis of national security? This would be a clear violation of international human rights law as such protests in no way threaten the existence or territorial integrity of the Peoples Republic of China, but an administrative officer who serves at the pleasure of the Chief Executive is more likely to err on the side of state interests, particularly when high-level mainland officials have expressed their displeasure at such commemorations. Although the Clarification of April 21 states that judicial review would be available for appeals of decisions made on the basis of national security under either the Societies or Public Order ordinances (3.A), the fact is that courts traditionally defer to the executive on this precise question. Review is likely to be limited to whether a decision indeed was """"based on ?national security'considerations"""" (Clarification, 3.A) and not whether national security interests warranted the particular restriction imposed with respect to international human rights law. National security issues may also fall within the purview of matters that ultimately may be taken out of the hands of Hong Kong courts and decided by the National Peoples Congress in Beijing, under the doctrine of acts of state.(8)   12. The licensing requirement is likely to create conflicts between the public and the authorities where none existed before, particularly with respect to the seven day or forty-eight hour advance notice provision. A notification system poses less burden on the organizers of assemblies, in that they may presume their demonstrations are legal until the government informs them otherwise; a licensing system will require organizers to wait in uncertainty as to whether their assemblies may proceed until shortly before the scheduled time. This will inhibit preparations that can avert disorder, such as the training of parade supervisors and preparation of safety measures. The forty-eight hour requirement disregards the fact that there is a right to demonstrate spontaneously, in reaction to current events. Inevitably, there will be such protests, which currently are handled without great difficulty by the police in Hong Kong. However, if all such spontaneous demonstrations are considered illegal and subject to suppression, the potential for clashes between police and demonstrators, and litigation against the government, will escalate.   13. Finally, no adequate rationale is offered for switching to a more restrictive and easily abused system for regulating demonstrations. The Consultative Document acknowledges that Hong Kong has had remarkably few public order problems, and cites only instances of blocking traffic, trespassing on consular property or disrupting commercial premises (3.3). As many others have pointed out, Hong Kong has ample remedies in criminal and tort law to these abuses, and nothing in the law at present would prevent a constable from arresting those who disrupt public order. The truth is that Hong Kong is an orderly and stable society right now and is likely to remain such after June 30, 1997. It has experienced thousands of peaceful demonstrations in recent years with no severe repercussions for either public order or the national security of China or the United Kingdom. The present laws appear to be functioning smoothly, as evidenced by the complete lack of appeals to the board empowered to review decisions to ban or condition demonstrations under the present law.   Freedom of Association and the Societies Ordinance   14. As set forth in an annex to the Consultation Document, the proposed amendments to the Societies Ordinance would replace the present notification system with a registration system for virtually all non-commercial organizations in Hong Kong, with the exception of a narrow range of charitable groups. The Societies Officer (the Commissioner of Police) would be able to refuse to register a society, or recommend the closure of a registered society, """"in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedom of others,"""" a condition that repeats language of the ICCPR, without, however, its requirement that any limitation be """"necessary in a democratic society,"""" as discussed above.   15. In addition, the officer may also in certain circumstances refuse to register, or recommend the closure of, a society which engages in """"political activities,"""" meaning """"promoting or preparing"""" a candidate for election or """"facilitating"""" members who serve on the elected or provisional Legislative Council, Urban Council, Regional Council or District Boards in executing their official functions. The circumstances where such """"political activities"""" would trigger removal from the list of the Societies Registrar include soliciting or accepting contributions, loans or other forms of financial support """"directly or indirectly, from an alien or from a foreign organization"""" or merely having """"a connection with a foreign political organization."""" An """"alien"""" is defined as anyone who is not a citizen of the People's Republic of China (this would cover a significant portion of Hong Kong's inhabitants who have only permanent resident status; it is also a restriction that has no conceivable counterpart in the former pre-1992 version of the law). A """"connection"""" would include situations where the society solicits or accepts money, is affiliated directly or indirectly with the foreign political organization, where the society's policies """"are determined by or at the suggestion of, or in collaboration with"""" the foreign organization, or where the foreign group """"directs, dictates, controls, influences or participates directly or indirectly in the management or the decision making process"""" of the society. A """"foreign political organization"""" is a foreign government or its political subdivision; an """"instrumentality"""" of such a government or subdivision, or """"an international political organization."""" The amendments provide that the above situations could be considered as not in the interests of national security or public safety, public order or the protection of public morals """"in the absence of evidence to the contrary."""" This language appears designed to insulate the provision from being challenged on the grounds that it contravenes the ICCPR. However, it wrongly places the burden on individuals to produce evidence that a valid national interest is not under threat rather than on the government to demonstrate that any such threat actually exists. It omits the requirement that restrictions be necessary and proportional, and indeed, fails to demonstrate that any of the listed activities actually constitute a threat to the existence of the state, or maintenance of public order.   16. The proposed amendments are fraught with vague or overbroad terms that would significantly impair freedom of association in Hong Kong. Terms such as """"promoting"""" """"preparing"""" or """"facilitating"""" the work of political candidates cover a multitude of innocuous activities, as do """"suggestion"""" or """"collaboration"""" in determining a society's policies. What constitutes influencing or participating indirectly in a group's decision-making process? Virtually any communication between a foreign group and a Hong Kong society may influence the latter's decisions; taken literally, this provision would cut off many local groups from foreign contacts altogether. What is an """"instrumentality"""" of a foreign government? It could be a charitable foundation that receives government support or a former ambassador. An """"international political organization"""" could be the United Nations or the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, a human rights organization or an international environmental coalition. The Clarification states that """"we envisage ?political organisations' to include political parties only"""" (3.B), but does not explain whether this is true for those political organizations that are """"international.""""   17. While the stated objective of these amendments is """"preventing societies in Hong Kong from being controlled by foreign political forces"""" (4.3), in fact the language goes far beyond to inhibit association in a multitude of circumstances protected by international human rights law. For example, as presently drafted, it is conceivable that a labor organization that endorses a political candidate could be banned if it relays to the candidate the positions of its international labor federation. A political party could be banned for incorporating into its platform the findings of a foreign government's environmental agency, or for inviting members of the International Parliamentary Union to monitor an election campaign, or for hosting visits by foreign political officials. Foreign foundations that support research and training programs designed to assist legislators in China could not fund similar activities in Hong Kong. Experts affiliated directly, or even indirectly with an """"instrumentality"""" of a foreign government or an """"international political organization"""" could not serve as board members or advisors to local societies; it might be risky for them even to send e-mail or make telephone calls if such would be likely to influence the local group. Universities that receive foreign grants might not be able to invite legislators to a symposium, or transmit research on social policies to them. Political parties in Hong Kong would be prohibited from accepting donations even from permanent residents who are entitled to vote in elections, and student demonstrators who endorse particular political candidates had better not let tourists drop contributions into a hat. Such examples cannot be dismissed as ridiculous, however far-fetched they appear, because of the imprecision in the drafting of these proposals.   18. No compelling reason has been given to justify any of these new restrictions, or indeed, the need to register societies at all. Registration requirements in countries such as the United States hinge not on the foreign contacts of an organization or its political activities, but on the nature of the benefits the organization wishes to enjoy. For example, in order to obtain a certain tax status, a group must register as a corporation, or to gain tax deductions for its donors, as a not-for-profit organization. It is unconstitutional under U.S. law to require an organization to list its members as part of a registration requirement, or to impose registration requirements on account of political views.(10)   18. Indeed, the government already has the power to prohibit the operation of a society where """"the operation or continued operation...may be prejudicial to the security of Hong Kong or to public safety or public order."""" The statement in the Consultative Document that the lack of a registration system makes it more difficult for the government to """"obtain additional information"""" where there are doubts whether a society should be allowed to operate cannot justify new restrictions, as such information most likely is already available through the notification system, or at any rate, could be obtained through a means that is far less burdensome to the right of association. The likelihood that registration will deter the formation of criminal societies is virtually nil; such groups are more likely to operate without submitting themselves to government scrutiny in the first place.   We appreciate the opportunity to take part in this consultation and hope very much that the plans to proceed with the proposed amendments will be halted.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1997/04/24/statement-mike-jendrzejczyk-washington-director","Statement by Mike Jendrzejczyk Washington Director","Statement by Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director","Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs","04/24/1997","Human Rights Watch/Asia is a private, independent human rights monitoring organization. We appreciate the opportunity to appear today before this Committee to present our perspective on human rights in Hong Kong.   In less than seventy days, Hong Kong will revert from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. But as the transition approaches, there is growing concern about whether China will keep its commitments to uphold basic human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong as promised in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law. The first is an international treaty, registered at the United Nations; the second is the """"mini-constitution"""" for the new Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, adopted by the National People's Congress (NPC) of China on April 4, 1990.   There is good reason for this concern. In recent months, Beijing has accelerated the process of asserting its control over Hong Kong, aiming to ensure """"social stability"""" and """"national security"""" during the transition and in the months after. And it has already begun to renege on key commitments that are crucial to Hong Kong maintaining a """"high degree of autonomy"""" after July 1, 1997.   For example, on December 21, 1996, Beijing set up an appointed """"provisional legislature"""" to replace Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) elected in September 1995, despite the fact that its current four year term has yet to expire. Consisting of sixty individuals chosen by Beijing's hand-picked Selection Committee, the provisional legislature is not mentioned in either the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law. (In fact, Article 68 and Annex II of the Basic Law clearly state that the first Legislative Council of the SAR should be constituted by election.)   But this sham group is already meeting across the border in Shenzhen, and has begun to prepare and draft laws to be enacted and to come into force as of July 1. Fifty of the sixty members are from the Selection Committee itself; thirty-three are members of the elected Legco. The strongest parties represented are pro-business and pro-China; the Democratic Party led by Martin Lee boycotted the entire process calling it illegitimate. Elections have been promised by Mr.Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive- designate for the SAR, sometime in the next year, under a scheme yet to be devised by the provisional legislature.   Hong Kong thus currently finds itself in the bizarre situation of having two legislatures sitting simultaneously: one elected by the people of Hong Kong, and the other appointed by and accountable to the Chinese government.   There are other clear reasons for concern: Hong Kong's free press and the independent judiciary have been threatened. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen warned last October that the media can be critical, but cannot put forward """"rumors or lies"""" or publish """"personal attacks on the Chinese leaders."""" Self-censorship is already prevalent in much of the press, and the decision last week by the South China Morning Post to hire a senior Chinese editor from Beijing as a """"consultant"""" has increased concern. Article 23 of the Basic Law calls for the adoption of new laws on subversion, succession and theft of state secrets, and measures """"to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign organizations or bodies."""" It is widely feared that these laws could be used by the future SAR government to repress China's critics and to restrict free expression.   Members of the business community I've spoken to in Hong Kong, while publicly optimistic, are privately worried about the possible erosion of the rule of law over time, the spread of corruption into Hong Kong from mainland China, and possible attempts to control the press or restrict the free flow of information. Some are not convinced that Beijing fully comprehends that these are all essential ingredients to Hong Kong's continued success as a thriving international financial center.   In recent weeks, China has unleashed an international and local furor in Hong Kong by its blatant attempts to roll back fundamental freedoms and civil rights protections in the territory. I would like to concentrate, in my testimony today, on these ominous developments and their implications, and then will make some recommendations for U.S. policy towards Hong Kong.   Hong Kong's Civil Rights Laws:   In January 1997, the Preparatory Committee, a body appointed by China to handle transition matters, decided to repeal sixteen Hong Kong laws, including key provisions of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights Ordinance, and to amend nine others. The Bill of Rights Ordinance was enacted in 1991 in order to bring Hong Kong into full compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) by incorporating its guarantees into Hong Kong law. (The ICCPR has been applied to Hong Kong since 1976, when the UK ratified it; China has neither signed nor ratified the ICCPR but has agreed in the Joint Declaration that it should remain in force in Hong Kong.) The National People's Congress ratified the Preparatory Committee's decision in February. But as the Hong Kong Bar Council and other legal experts have observed, Beijing took this action claiming these laws were in contradiction to the Basic Law without providing any explanation whatsoever of precisely how they violated the Basic Law.   Two of the laws to be changed are the 1992 Societies Ordinance and the 1995 Public Order Ordinance, which had been amended to conform with the Bill of Rights in order to firmly protect freedom of association and freedom of assembly. These laws, as amended, have adequately provided for the maintenance of public order even as Hong Kong people have increasingly exercised their right to gather, protest and demonstrate.   To fill the legal vacuum created by the changes, the provisional legislature is preparing to enact new regulations to take effect on July 1. They would require all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to register with the police, impose restrictions on public demonstrations, and empower the government to ban some organizations altogether. Mr. C.H. Tung issued a """"Consultation Document"""" earlier this month outlining the basic provisions of these draconian proposals, saying he was trying to achieve a """"balance between civil liberties and social stability."""" He also justified these more stringent controls by saying that """"Hong Kong is extremely vulnerable to external forces"""" -- repeating Beijing's constant warnings about subversion. All """"political organizations"""" would be prohibited from soliciting or accepting financial assistance from abroad. Most significantly, Mr. Tung is justifying these measures on grounds of """"national security.""""   In the view of Margaret Ng, a Hong Kong legislator and attorney, """"China's paranoia about Hong Kong being used as a base for subversion colors the whole issue of the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong after July 1."""" In fact, the """"Consultation Document"""" says quite bluntly: """"We must (also) take steps to prevent Hong Kong from being used for political activities against China.""""   Civil rights and church organizations in Hong Kong, legislators, the press, the Hong Kong government and Gov. Chris Pattern, the State Department and the White House, as well as international human rights organizations, have sharply criticized the new proposed laws. Mr. Tung's ratings in the polls in Hong Kong have taken a nose-dive (the South China Morning Post, on April 14, 1997, reported that more than forty-five percent of respondents said they had less trust in Mr. Tung to safeguard their interests than when he was appointed). In the last few days, Mr. Tung and his aides, responding to this barrage of criticism from the Hong Kong community, have stated that changes can be made, but only in minor details and not the basic principles. But the fact that Mr. Tung is reacting to pressure is a positive sign, and we hope the pressure can be increased in the coming weeks.   Here is a brief description of two of the most controversial provisions:   -- Under the 1992 Societies Ordinance, organizations simply notify the police within one month of their establishment. Under the new law, NGO's must register with the police and their application can be denied in the interests of national security or public safety or public order, or if the organization engages in """"political activities"""" and has ties to foreign organizations, such as accepting financial contributions from foreign organizations or allowing foreign groups to influence its activities.   -- Notification of police, under the 1995 Public Order Ordinance, is required if more than thirty people are to gather, not less than 24 hours in advance. The police can deny permission in the interests of public order or safety. In fact, hundreds of protests are routinely allowed without incident. Under the proposed law, the police must issue a """"Notice of No Objection"""" before a peaceful protest or demonstration can take place. They can refuse to issue a notice citing national security, public safety public order, protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The definition of """"national security"""" is extremely vague.   These, and other provisions, give wider powers and enormous discretion to the police, and leave the chief executive, Mr. C.H. Tung, as the ultimate arbiter. An """"independent appeal board"""" chaired by a retired judge will be set up to hear appeals of the Police Commissioner's decisions, but the appointment of that board will presumably be made by the Chief Executive. In fact, many in Hong Kong have pointed out that there is no threat to national security, public safety or public order in Hong Kong to justify these new controls, and no changes are needed in the existing laws.   We are most alarmed by the rationale Mr. Tung has given for these new controls, namely that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allows these restrictions, and that they are no more onerous than similar requirements in U.S. law. In fact, the ICCPR does allow some limitations on basic political rights, such as the rights of association and assembly protected in Articles 21 and 22, but they must be clearly """"necessary in a democratic society."""" As the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights has noted, the broad formulations contained in the ICCPR are customarily interpreted in international law to refer, among other things, to situations that clearly threaten public order and national security such as the event of a civil war, disclosure of military secrets, or a demonstration calling for the violent overthrow of the government. A threat to national security is not the same as a threat to any given government, and mere criticism of the governing party or its policies should not be restricted in the name of national security. But Mr. Tung has apparently interpreted the language to mean that the ICCPR broadly sanctions restriction of rights.   It is certainly true that in the U.S., you are required to notify the police and obtain a permit if you plan to hold a demonstration on a public thoroughfare. However, the only grounds on which the authorities can deny permission are """"time, place, and manner"""" restrictions. They cannot, under the U.S.Constitution, deny a permit because of political context or the ideology of the group sponsoring the demonstration.   It is also true that in the U.S., there are registration requirements for associations, but these stem from the nature of the benefits conferred by different kinds of association rather than from their political content or purpose. For example, organizations have to register as corporations to obtain certain legal benefits or tax status. It is unconstitutional under U.S. law to impose restrictions because of a group's political activities or views, or the nature of its membership. Finally, it is important to note the role of the U.S. courts in providing judicial review of these decisions by police authorities in order to safeguard freedom of speech and assembly. Thus far, it is unclear precisely what role the Hong Kong courts will have in overseeing implementation of the new laws.   I would also add that introducing the concept of """"national security"""" into Hong Kong's laws in this way seems to deliberately echo steps already taken in mainland China to stifle dissent using stringent security laws. In an extensive report we will publish next week with another group, Human Rights in China, we analyze the recent reforms in China's criminal code in which """"counterrevolutionary crimes"""" were abolished, but the NPC has created new categories of offenses under the rubric of """"endangering state security.""""   U.S. Policy:   The U.S. has a strong interest in seeing a smooth transition in Hong Kong, and in Hong Kong maintaining a """"high degree of autonomy"""" after July 1. These interests are well defined in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. That law provides specific benchmarks and a regular reporting mechanism to assess the implementation of China's obligations towards Hong Kong, as well as authority to the President to suspend existing laws with respect to Hong Kong if he determines that Hong Kong is """"not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment under a particular law of the U.S...different from that accorded the People's Republic of China.""""   The U.S. also has a larger agenda with China, with a wide range of economic, security and other interests with Beijing and in the region. The survival of Hong Kong must not be sacrificed for those other interests.   Given the importance of the U.S.-Sino relationship -- as evidenced by Secretary of State Albright's recent visit, literally the day before Deng Xiaoping's funeral -- there is potential leverage that could be used, in a constructive way, to press Beijing to honor its commitments to Hong Kong.   The Clinton Administration, until recently, had been muted and rather low-key in response to China's actions. It said, for example, that the abolition of the elected legislature was """"unwise and unnecessary"""" but refrained from saying it clearly violates the Joint Declaration. The Administration has been more forthright in criticizing the moves taken in the past several weeks to stifle civil rights in Hong Kong, and the President, following his meeting with Martin Lee last week, warned China's leaders to """"live up to their agreement"""" to protect basic rights in Hong Kong.   However, we were deeply disappointed by Vice President Gore's decision not to visit Hong Kong when he traveled to China last month. Nor did he speak up clearly and publicly in Beijing on behalf of Hong Kong, as he might have done, for example, during the ceremony initialing a new consular agreement.   We would urge the Administration and Congress to take the following steps in the coming weeks and months:   1) The Administration has announced that President Jiang Zemin will be invited to the U.S. for a summit meeting later this year, but has yet to set the date. When Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visits Washington this weekend, we hope Secretary Albright and President Clinton will make it clear that future high level exchanges -- including a summit in the U.S. this year and the President's planned trip to China next year -- can only take place in the context of significant progress on human rights in China and full respect of Beijing's obligations towards Hong Kong.   2) The U.S. hosts the G-7 industrial leaders summit meeting in Denver on June 22, just days before the handover. It would be very useful if the G-7 leaders, representing virtually all of China's major trade and aid partners, included in their joint communique a strong call on China to respect its promises to maintain an elected legislature, independent judiciary, free press, and other basic human rights in Hong Kong. The G-7 should also agree to assess, at their 1998 summit, China's compliance with these promises.   A multilateral agenda for Hong Kong and human rights in China is desperately needed in the wake of China's triumphant defeat of a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights earlier this month, using its economic clout to prevent a mild resolution from even coming up for a debate and vote.   3) When C.H. Tung visits the U.S. later this year, to """"dispel misconceptions"""" about Hong Kong, we hope that the Administration and members of Congress will raise questions with him -- frankly and directly -- about many of the concerns discussed at this hearing.   4) We would urge the Administration, both in Washington and through the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, to be pro-active in stimulating the U.S. business community to be more outspoken, using both private and public channels to raise concerns with Beijing and C.H. Tung about the rule of law, civil liberties, and the essential role of NGOs in Hong Kong. If the business community is perceived as willing to play along passively, they will be open to criticism later if Beijing miscalculates or moves to gradually dismantle or undermine Hong Kong's key institutions.   5) We appreciate the positive role of the U.S. consulate in supporting NGOs in Hong Kong, listening to their needs, and serving as a channel for their concerns. This role will become even more important later this year and next year as legal reforms being enacted now are actually implemented and NGOs may be targeted.   6) We believe members of Congress have been crucial in speaking out for human rights in Hong Kong, both through legislation -- such as the Hong Kong Reversion Act, adopted in the House on March 11, 1997 -- and through regular visits to Hong Kong. Those visits will become even more valuable and necessary after July 1 this year, and next year. In addition, Congress might consider sending a symbolic message of support to the Legco on its last business meeting in late June. The Senate adopted a unanimous resolution in June 1996 condemning the abolition of Legco; a positive message of support, perhaps in conjunction with parliamentarians from Europe, Japan, Korea, Canada, India and other countries, would no doubt be appreciated by the people of Hong Kong.   Additional US policy options:   The US should develop a range possible responses, on a continuum, calibrated to respond to China's actions towards HK. Where possible, it should try to coordinate multilateral actions with other goverments with strong trade/political ties to Beijing eg EU, Japan, Australia, Korea, Canada.   The US should, for example, react strongly to the enactment of the proposed laws placing new restrictions on civil liberties..It should also respond to any new security laws enacted under Article 23, and formally protest if the framework for elections for the new Legco in the SAR does not allow free & open participation, incluidng from strong critics of China.   Possible actions, in addition to public statements, based on an assessment of what political/economic pressure points will deliver the most effective message directly to Beijing, without damaging Hong Kong: (in no particular order)   -- Put off presidential summit meeting planned for Nov.; or, if meeting goes ahead, downgrade high profile events with Jiang and Clinton, restrict scale and length of visit  -- Withdraw from WTO negotiations or put the talks on hold (most effective if done in conjunction with other governments, though this will be difficult to pull off) --Coordinate, with EU & others, suspension of any planned trade delegations to China or high level business deals due to be signed with Beijing -- Use the opportunity of the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in Hong Kong in late September to make public statements, symbolic actions (eg US delegates meeting with NGOs that are targetted, outspoken former Legco members, members of the Bar Council and Journalists Assoc.) Hong Kong should be prominent in private talks with senior Chinese officials attending the meeting & CH Tung. --Delay MFN renewal decision until September 1997 (Senator Connie Mack is planning to introduce legislation that would do this) --Biapartsian Congressional and business delegations of CEO's go to Beijing to deliver direct messages to senior leaders that continued actions against Hong Kong would seriously affect prospects for either permanent MFN/a WTO deal, or summit meetings. Gingrich and Lott should be prepared to lead such delegations, along with Gephardt and Daschle.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

He also called for police to track down the attackers who threw at least three grenades into the demonstration but indicated that the protest leaders bore responsibility for the crime as well. “I wish to appeal to all armed forces and the authorized people to conduct an investigation immediately in order to arrest the criminals and to find out and arrest the leaders of the demonstration that caused people to die,” Hun Sen said in a radio address. Hun Sen did not name prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, whose unrecognized opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP) organized the demonstration, but said he had ordered the interior ministry to prevent Cambodians with dual nationality who may have been involved in the demonstration, from leaving the country. “I have ordered (chief of national police) General Hok Longdy to close Pochentong International Airport and not allow any planes to carry people suspected of (organizing) the demonstration,” he said. Sam Rainsy, who holds both Cambodian and French passports, said he considered the comments to refer to him and challenged Hun Sen, the powerful vice-president of the formerly communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP), to arrest him. He said he was planning to leave the country on a previously scheduled trip to the United States on April 7 and dared Hun Sen to arrest him before. “I have no intention to change my plan,” he said. “I am leaving on the seventh. I urge Hun Sen to come to arrest me before the seventh.” Sam Rainsy, who has alleged that Hun Sen and the CPP were behind the attack, said accusations that the KNP bore responsibility for the carnage were totally false noting that they had received permission from the Phnom Penh municiple government to hold it. “We had permission, how can we be blamed for these deaths?” Sam Rainsy said. “It is very cynical.”","Asia, Cambodia",""

In it, the Ministry argues that the Popular Front of Azerbaijan was responsible for the civilian deaths, supporting this argument by referring to an interview with former President Ayaz Mutalibov and, incredibly, to a 1992 report by our organization.   The Ministry statement reads: """". . the militia of the Azerbaijani National Front actively obstructed and actually prevented the exodus of the local population through the mountain passages specifically left open by Karabakh Armenians to facilitate the flight of the civilian population. On this matter, the September 1992 Helsinki Watch non-governmental organization report quotes an Azerbaijani woman who says that Armenians had notified the Azerbaijani civilian population to leave the town with white flags raised, in fact the Azerbaijani militia shot those who attempted to flee."""" Our report indeed found that many residents of Khojaly may have had advance warning of the impending military operation, since Armenian forces had given an ultimatum to Alif Gajiyev, then head of the Khojaly militia, who in turn warned civilians. Our research and that of the Memorial Human Rights Center found that the retreating militia fled Khojaly along with some of the large groups of fleeing civilians. Our report noted that by remaining armed and in uniform, the Azerbaijani militia may be considered as combatants and thus endangered fleeing civilians, even if their intent had been to protect them. Yet we place direct responsibility for the civilian deaths with Karabakh Armenian forces. Indeed, neither our report nor that of Memorial includes any evidence to support the argument that Azerbaijani forces obstructed the flight of, or fired on Azeri civilians. For clarity's sake I cite our 1992 report (page 24): """" . . . Thus, a party that intersperses combatants with fleeing civilians puts those civilians at risk and violates its obligation to protect its own civilians. . . .[T]he attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. In particular, the party must suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."""" """"The circumstances surrounding the attack . . .on those fleeing Khojaly indicate that [Karabakh] Armenian forces and the troops of the 366th CIS regiment . . .deliberately disregarded this customary law restraint on attacks. Nagorno Karabakh officials and fighters clearly expected the inhabitants of Khojaly to flee since they claim to have informed the town that a corridor would be left open to allow for their safe passage. . . Under these circumstances, the killing of fleeing combatants could not justify the forseeably large number of civilian casualties."""" Please allow me to clarify another reference to our 1992 report, regarding the 1988 Sumgait pogrom. Our report reads: """"The most brutal of these events was the anti-Armenian pogrom in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, which took the lives of thirty-two Armenians, wounded hundreds more, and intensified the fears of ethnic Armenians living in other parts of Azerbaijan,"""" which differs from the citation used in the Ministry statement. We further cited the estimate of 300,000-350,000 ethnic Armenians who fled Azerbaijan, not 600,000 as the Ministry statement seemed to attribute to our report. We welcome the use of our reports by governments and intergovernmental organizations, and we sincerely hope that there will be no further misrepresentation regarding the contents of our 1992 report.

The report was released as Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), arrived in Hong Kong to help resolve outstanding issues related to the boat people. The report, Abuses Against Vietnamese Asylum Seekers in the Final Days of the Comprehensive Plan of Action, charges that determination of both the Hong Kong government and the UNHCR to respond to Chinese pressure has led to a single-minded focus on repatriation efforts and an effort to """"push"""" the Vietnamese out of Hong Kong by making conditions in the camps where they are detained increasingly intolerable. Those conditions, including overcrowding and even reports of hunger, fall well below standards set by the UNHCR itself. The emphasis on repatriation, according to the report, is particularly troubling given both flaws in the screening procedures to determine refugee status and a number of cases involving Vietnamese who have been harassed or who have otherwise encountered difficulties upon return to Vietnam. Human Rights Watch/Asia calls on the UNHCR to review the cases of Vietnamese asylum seekers with compelling refugee claims and to establish an independent evaluation team to assess the performance of its monitors in Vietnam. The UNHCR should also be more transparent about its monitoring of returnees by publishing periodic reports and making the policies and methodologies which guide its monitoring activities in Vietnam available to the public, the report says. The report notes with concern the possibility that some of the more than 2,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong whom the Vietnamese government has refused to take back on the grounds that they are not Vietnamese citizens would still be in Hong Kong by July 1. It calls on the Hong Kong government to immediately end their detention and make provision either for their resettlement in other countries or for their immediate integration into Hong Kong on the basis of permanent residence. In Hong Kong, the report notes, the challenge of dealing with refugees is not an issue which is unique to the Vietnamese. The report notes that a significant proportion of Hong Kong's native population are refugees or descendants of refugees who fled political oppression, social turmoil or natural disasters in China and elsewhere to seek haven in the territory. On the eve of Hong Kong's return to China, the saga of abuses against the Vietnamese boat people will remain a troubling legacy for both the Hong Kong government and the UNHCR unless concrete steps are taken to ensure that Hong Kong is a place where basic rights are protected and enjoyed by all people in the territory both today as well as after July 1.","Asia, China and Tibet, Vietnam",""

In a 50-page report, """"Whose Security? State Security in China's New Criminal Code,"""" Human Rights Watch/Asia and Human Rights in China examine the March 1997 decision by China's National People's Congress to remove the crime of """"counterrevolution"""" from the criminal code and replace it with """"endangering state security."""" Far from being a move toward judicial liberalization, the change has served to broaden the capacity of the state to suppress dissent. """"For several years now, Chinese officials have been deliberately fueling hopes by Western leaders that the long-awaited removal of 'counterrevolution' from the books would mean an end to China's institutionalized persecution of peaceful dissidents, religious activists, and supporters of nonviolent nationalist movements,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia.."""" But now that it's happened, it's clear nothing has changed."""" National security has long been invoked by authoritarian governments around the world as a pretext for suppressing freedom of expression and freedom of association, and China's new focus on state security may not bode well for those freedoms in Hong Kong. It comes as debate in Hong Kong heats up over amendments proposed by the office of the Chief-Executive designate, Tung Chee-hwa, that would restrict public processions and non-governmental associations on """"national security"""" grounds. The fact that China's legislators have left the definition of """"national security"""" entirely open to interpretation by the executive power, as this report shows, will be cold comfort to those fighting to protect Hong Kong's freedoms after the July 1, 1997 transfer of sovereignty. The new report notes several disturbing aspects of the security provisions of the newly revised criminal code. They include: punishment of contact with individuals and organizations outside China: In the revised code, """"colluding with institutions, organizations, or individuals outside China to harm state security is seen as essentially the same as """"colluding with foreign powers,"""" while giving information to any outsider is seen as analogous to obtaining or providing state secrets for an enemy. Actions which involve some foreign connection are subject to harsher punishments than those that are purely domestic, and those inside and outside China who subsidize acts which endanger state security may be prosecuted and imprisoned. highlighting crimes of separatism Splitting the nation or sabotaging national unity has become a whole separate article in the new law, emphasizing the authorities' battle against separatist forces in places like Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. increasing limits on freedom of expression The scope of what can be considered subversive, seditious or secessionist expression appears to be even broader than in the 1979 criminal code. The clearest indicator that the recent legislative changes mean no substantive shift in the government's hardline approach toward those expressing critical viewpoints was that senior officials announced in advance that the several thousand people already serving prison terms for counterrevolutionary offenses would not be eligible for any kind of amnesty or early release as a consequence of the criminal code """"reforms."""" Even though the offenses for which they were jailed no longer exist, they will continue serving their sentences to the bitter end. Human Rights in China and Human Rights Watch/Asia call on the Chinese government to promptly and unconditionally release all persons currently serving jail sentences under Article 98 (""""organizing or participating in a counterrevolutionary group""""), Article 99 (""""using a reactionary sect or society to carry on counterrevolutionary activities"""") and Article 102 (""""engaging in counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement"""") of the old criminal code, since those statutes targeted solely the exercise of the internationally-guaranteed rights to freedom of expression and association. The two human rights groups note that large-scale """"special pardons"""" of this type have been carried out by the Chinese government in the past, and that July 1, 1997 would be a particularly suitable occasion for the granting of a similar official amnesty to China's political prisoner population. The organizations call for the establishment of a nationwide """"Commission of Review"""" to reexamine all other cases of persons sentenced on charges of counterrevolution, with a view to the exoneration and release--prior to the fiftieth anniversary of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1999--of all those found also to have been imprisoned solely on the grounds of the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

In a resolution adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China targeted provisions of the Societies Ordinance, Public Order Ordinance, sections of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, and legislation related to the 1992 electoral reforms as among those local laws which will cease to be effective when the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997.  """"Freedom of association and freedom of assembly are fundamental rights under international law,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. """"China's decision to change sections of the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance, which were amended to conform with the Bill of Rights in 1992 and 1995 respectively, will restrict these basic rights after the handover. Current laws have adequately provided for the maintenance of public order even as Hong Kong people have increasingly exercised their right to gather, protest and demonstrate. Therefore, proposals to reinstate old versions of these ordinances are not only unnecessary, but they also contradict efforts to make local laws fully compatible with international human rights standards.""""  She also noted that the Bill of Rights was adopted in an attempt to ensure that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) remain in force in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) after July 1, as stipulated in the two fundamental documents on the reversion, the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, adopted in 1991. The latter will serve as the mini-constitution for the SAR. There has been strong opposition within Hong Kong to China's efforts to weaken human rights-related laws, expressed most recently in a Legislative Council motion, endorsed by both the Democratic and Liberal Parties on February 19. The motion urged the National People's Congress in Beijing not to accept the Preparatory Committee's proposals. China's decision, which was announced on February 22 at the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 8th NPC, is based on Beijing's belief that China retains the right to overturn all the laws that have been changed after the 1984 Joint Declaration. Influenced largely by the 1995 recommendations of the now defunct Preliminary Working Committee and the more recent proposals of the Preparatory Committee's legal subgroup, the Standing Committee's resolution clearly targets the laws which were amended to conform with the 1991 Bill of Rights, as well as the electoral reforms introduced by Governor Chris Patten in 1992. Thus far, however, China has failed to provide any substantive explanation as to how the twenty-four laws in question violate, as repeatedly claimed by Chinese officials, Article 160 of the Basic Law. (The latter states merely that any laws discovered to be in contravention of the Basic Law shall be amended or abolished upon the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.)  In addition to reviving draconian colonial security laws, the decision to abolish and amend current ordinances may result either in a legal vacuum or a constitutional crisis. Contrary to statements made by Tung Chee-hwa, who will become chief executive of Hong Kong on July 1, the intention to repeal or amend a law does not automatically bring back to force the former version of that law. In order for the future SAR government to avoid a legal vacuum on July 1, the day the Standing Committee's resolution will come into effect, it will have to legislate on these areas before it officially assumes authority. It is likely the provisional legislature, a body whose legality is widely questioned, will take on this responsibility and thus precipitate a legal challenge by members of the current elected Legislative Council who have already threatened to bring the group to court in the event it meets and acts on legislation before the handover date.  In light of the impact that the Standing Committee's resolution may have on basic civil liberties in Hong Kong after the handover, Human Rights Watch/Asia urges that: China provide an explanation as to how the twenty-four laws identified by the Standing Committee's resolution contravene Article 160 of the Basic Law.  The future Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, reject the reinstatement of draconian security laws, and ensure that no new legislation or amendments be adopted that are more restrictive of rights than existing laws.  The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region uphold promises to conduct wide public consultations in Hong Kong before the formulation of any new legislation. Such consultations should include public debate and be as broad and representative as possible.","Asia, China and Tibet",""
